Five Gold Crowns. Just started reading WoT (on book 4) recommended by my GF. Mat is her favorite character, so I tried to make a thing

Looking for a recommendation after finishing Sanderson and Rothfuss. I went through the recommendations guide, but was honestly overwhelmed with all of the options.  I'm hoping to get some feedback from you guys!

Here are my answers to the questionaire.  I apologize for the wall of text:

Are you new to Fantasy or have you read many of the greatest hits?
These are the books/series in the r/fantasy top 100 that I have read. I’ve ranked them in my order of enjoyment, first to last.
1) The Stormlight Archive
2) Mistborn
3) The Kingkiller Chronicle
4) Harry Potter
5) Wheel of Time
6) Warbreaker
7) His Dark Materials
8) Elantris
9) The Emperor's Soul
10) The Inheritance Cycle
11) Redwall
12) A Song of Ice and Fire
13) Middle-Earth Universe
14) The Chronicles of Narnia

What traits do you most value in books, for example: Characterization, Prose, Story, Setting, etc.?
I want to care about the characters. That’s probably the biggest thing my top 7 books have in common from my perspective.  I want a strong story that doesn’t follow typical fantasy narratives, but also isn’t just avoiding tropes for the sake of avoiding them.  Setting doesn’t matter as much but swords and sorcery have been pretty appealing to me recently.

What are some books that you read and enjoyed and what did you like about them?
I want to especially highlight how much I enjoyed Stormlight.  I read all three books in the span of 4-5 weeks and was generally incapable of putting them down once sat down to start reading for the day.  Some other highlights of specific books in there:  The Final Empire, The Deathly Hallows, All 3 sanderson books in WoT + books 1 and 2, The Amber Spyglass.

What are some books you read and disliked and what did you dislike about them?
Did not particularly enjoy Books 4 and 5 of ASOIAF.  I found them to be pretty dry and no longer cared about most of the characters.
I also struggled through the middle section of books in Wheel of Time.  Not a lot was really happening that seemed to matter in the grand scheme of the narrative. I once described them as 950 pages of political posturing and 50 pages of action.  That may be generous

Are you looking for a series or a standalone novel?
	Either is fine, but slight preference to a series.

If a series, does it need to be completed?
	No, but would rather avoid stories that are iffy on if it will be completed, e.g. ASOIAF.

Are you interested in classics, modern works or does it not matter?
	Preference would be modern.

What manner of tone? Lighthearted adventure, grim and cynical wars or something in between?
Somewhere in between.  I want there to be real and serious consequences, but not everything has to be an apocalypse.  Some lighthearted moments are important and keep the world from being overly depressing.

What complexity and depth level? Simpler, straightforward and easy to digest, or sprawling epic spanning multiple continents and thousands of years?
I like complexity and depth, but I don’t want to have to rely on the internet to remind me who a character is or why a certain event matters.  I'd like to avoid the YA level of fiction, but I am open to it if it fits.

Anything specific you are looking for, like a female main character, books about thieves or assassins, non-medieval Europe analogue setting, or talking animals?
	Well thought out, unique, and consistent magic system

Reading WoT for the first time before the series comes out... So, I’m only about halfway through Eye of the World right now (and really enjoying it), but despite my ignorance I just had to throw out a name for what I think would be some perfect casting, because I haven’t seen it on any of the lists I’ve looked at yet. Does anyone else just see Hayley Atwell in their head every time Moiraine is mentioned?

What is your elevator pitch for WoT. I have been trying desperately to get into WoT. I love fantasy and have read everything from Tolkien to all of Sanderson's works (just not WoT). When I start to read Eye of the World I find it kinda dull and give up after 250 pages. Maybe it is the 14 books or maybe I have really any clue of what is going on. I think what I need is people's elevator pitch on how you have gotten other people to read the series. Maybe that might get me out of this sorta reading slump of false starts.

Wheel of Time would be better as an anime than live action Reasons why I think this is the case:

1. If made into a live action TV series, it will inevitably get compared with Game of Thrones, and it won't come out on top. Game of Thrones has great mainstream appeal because its not very nerdy/geeky compared to most fantasy. WoT will not be able to have a comparable budget to GoT despite having far more sfx needed for magic, resulting in a forgettable, mediocre production that gets cancelled before finishing.

2. Going off my last point, WoT has much higher appeal in geeky crowds. I'm willing to bet that many of the people who would enjoy WoT but aren't interested in reading a massive 14 book series, or haven't been exposed to it, enjoy anime.

3. For the non-anime watchers here, WHEEL OF TIME IS ONE OF THE MOST ANIME THINGS THERE IS. Teenagers/young adults saving the universe? Check. Gender stereotypes? Check. Flashy sword and magic-based combatants with superhuman physical abilities? Check. Harem for male main character? Check. Tsundere? Check. Well-defined power levels/benchmarks of both good and evil side characters so the growth of the main characters is clear? Check. Surrounded by a glow of light when using magic that gets brighter with the strength of the character in question? Check. Screaming when doing so? Check.

As an anime, WoT could be portrayed in quality with a much smaller budget, could appeal to the right crowd, and has a higher chance of not becoming forgettable/cancelled.

10 Years I finally finished it. The Wheel of Time series has been with me for 10 years.  Through fits and starts, re-reads, burnouts, and everything in between I finally pushed through and finished it.  I met a woman and we got married in the time it took me to watch the three scrappy ta'veren weave the pattern around them.



Unfortunately, though, I don't have anyone in my life who is even aware of these books.  I've spent time with friends and family without them even knowing the adventures I've read.  I don't know why I'm writing this post. I'm not looking for a parade of congratulations or anything.  Maybe I just want to tell someone about the gravity I feel of finishing something that took a third of my life to complete. Someone else who might understand.



I feel somewhat somber now, for some reason. Not a sadness, per se, but more like the feeling you'd get once you climb a great mountain, and now all there is left to do is climb back down.


Thank you for reading and I'm happy to be in the fold of the other WoT readers.  There are no endings, but this is *an* ending.

When is the best time to take a break? I want to dive into WOT but I'm also in the middle right now of trekking through the Malazan series. What would be the best stopping point for me? I've heard trom some people that Book 3 was originally intended to be the final installment but I've also heard that Book 4 is widely regarded by fans to be the best in the entire series (so i don't want to miss out on it)

When should a first-time reader of the series begin New Spring? I've just come back to the series after a decade-long hiatus and picked up the prequel to start my re-exploration of the Wheel of Time universe. My girlfriend is interested in the books as well, so I lent her the Eye of the World, as it seems that New Spring requires a greater knowledge of the WoT lore to grasp what's happening from the get-go. Anyway, I was just wondering what the community's thoughts were regarding where New Spring fits best in the series for a first-timer. Cheers!

Didn't like Malazan. Started WOT - am I doomed to not like as well? I recently finished all 10 books of Malazan Book of the Fallen. I really enjoyed The first few books of the series, but after about book 5 it was torture. Books 6-10 I think I skimmed about 50% of it due to boredom. I stuck with it just to see the ending, which I thought was pretty awful and unsatisfying.
So I'm looking for another series to read, and I've decided to try Wheel of Time. Do you think because I didn't like Malazan that I am doomed to not like WOT as well? Considering they are both really long series and from what I've heard WOT gets pretty slow in the middle. Is there anyone who disliked Malazan but ended up liking WOT?

If I had to sum up the three main reasons for my dislike in Malazan it would be 1) Too many side characters/stories that have zero importance to the main plot, 2) Alluding to so many mysterious/powerful things that are never revealed or explained
3) A lack of a common plot that drives the series. For example: LOTR from book 1-3 its about destroying that ring. ASOIAF, its about controlling the kingdom and dealing with whitewalkers. But Malazan felt disjointed. Some books felt like they had little to do with any other. And it seemed like the author just randomly decided what would be the ultimate bad guy to overcome by like book 9.

On a side note: Series that I have read and have really enjoyed include ASOIAF, Kingkiller Chron, LOTR, and some of the earlier Terry Brooks Shannara books.

TLDR: I didn't like Malazan series, is is likely that I won't like WOT also?

(Spoilers COT) Thoughts after finishing Crossroads of Twilight Come reminisce about your first time finishing the tenth book: your favorite bits, the parts that annoyed you, and everything in between. I'm making these posts as I finish each book so as to consolidate my thoughts and preserve my first impressions to look back on later on. If you're interested here are links to posts I've made so far:

[Winter’s Heart]( https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/7tyrnd/spoilers_wh_thoughts_after_finishing_winters_heart/)

Before I begin let me remind you that the scope of spoilers on this post is up to Winter's Heart, please don't discuss anything after. Also keep in mind the fact that even hinting at events in future books is still giving something away. Even saying something like "you'll find out more about that later" is still kind of a hint.

So here we are, the consensus worst book in the series. Does it deserve that title?

**Stuff I Liked**

* Crossroads of Twilight: Conceptually I like Jordan’s idea of using the cleansing of saidin as a universal presence to catch up all the storylines. Now that many of the main characters have been separated for so long it is a clever way to develop a connection between them. Probably the most interesting reaction we get are the Salidar Aes Sedai who think a weapon of the Forsaken, as they are the only ones who go see what is up at the late Shadar Logoth.

* White Tower: After being frustrated that Winter’s Heart had zero Egwene, I am happy to get some of the siege of Tar Valon in this one. Considering the reaction to the cleansing was the major catalyst for approaching the Black Tower, it makes more sense why Jordan would delay this storyline. There are so many storylines right now: the hunt for Black Ajah; Elaida vs Alviarin; Alviarin, Mesaana, &amp; Shaidar Haran; Red Ajah &amp; Black Tower; Salidar &amp; Black Tower; Aran’gar murdering Sisters with saidin; negotiations between White Tower &amp; Salidar; the siege; Egwene’s capture; and I’m sure I missed something. In the spirit of brevity I won’t go into all of them, but here are a couple of quick thoughts. Aran’gar/Halima is doing a great job sowing fear amongst the Sisters; Chesa, Egwene’s servant, is right on the money thinking Halima is sketchy. Perhaps the biggest shock here is the contingent of Red Sisters agreeing to approach the Asha’man, it’s always interesting to see a group compromise their most essential quality. We’ll see how that plays out with the Salidar contingency also approaching the Black Tower. What is the purpose of making the chain at the White Tower harbor into cuendillar? Egwene you dumb motherfucker, you let your ego get in the way and you got the Amyrlin Seat captured. You don’t see CEOs answering phones at the front desk, because they have more important stuff to deal with.

* Alliances: Like I mentioned with the Aes Sedai factions approaching the Black Tower, I liked seeing the other potential alliances forming. Perrin is considering going to the Seanchean for help against the Shaido. The prologue of the Domani/Taraboner alliance is reminiscent of the Borderlands alliance from POD. And the big one being Rand wanting to treat with the Seanchean. Interestingly the Seanchean response refers to meeting the Daughter of the Nine Moons, who we know to be AWOL.

* What Must Be Done: This might be the best chapter in Wheel of Time. There have been more epic fantasy moments but I don’t think there has been a chapter as well written as this one. Although I like the characters in the series, they often don’t feel very organic. But Perrin’s breakdown feels the most realistic of any character moment so far. He is emotionally exhausted, just as exhausted as all the readers who have followed this plotline for three books. All kidding aside I think this chapter was a great summation of everything we’ve seen Perrin do as a character so far, and his leaving of his axe stuck in a tree is a fantastic image. Also, Perrin’s disarming of the Aielman is the most violent moment we’ve seen so far. Sure the Asha’man are brutal but none of their fights feel as visceral as using an axe to chop someone’s hand off. Here we get a glimpse of what the darker, more adult version of the series that Jordan had originally planned might have looked like.

**Stuff I Didn’t Like**

* Crossroads of Twilight: While I commend the concept of using this book as a way to collect the threads of the storylines, at its core this is still a book more concerned with getting the pieces ready to be moved. As part of the overarching series, it is necessary. As a standalone book, it’s a simmer as opposed to a boil.

* Andor: Surprise! I don’t like Elayne’s storyline. I don’t think I am breaking new ground here by saying the struggle for the Lion Throne is not very interesting. Like many others Elayne is my least favorite major character. Couple that with the fact that I am going to have to look up what actually happened in her chapters is not a good recipe for success. The most interesting part of this storyline is the murder mystery from POD, but it only appears for a brief second. I’m going out on a limb here, Vandene killed Adeleas. I have no basis for this but Vandene killing her sister and then just playing up the whole grieving thing would be the most interesting outcome. There’s no way it’s true but who cares. The infamous bath scene is in this one but I would award High Seats as the worst chapter in the book. All the adolescent nobles Elayne has to deal with are unbelievably stupid and boring.

* Valan Luca: If you go back to my writeup of Fires of Heaven you can see my prediction he would be coming back, and that I would not be happy about. Well I was right. This guy is a dumbass, and I empathize with Mat’s frustration over Luca insisting to stop at every moment. Both Mat and I want Mat to do cool stuff and this joker keeps getting in our way.

**Who I’d Like to See More Of**

* Tuon: I don’t know if I like her or not but I definitely enjoy Mat’s interactions with Tuon. The moments where Tuon actually talks instead of sits there staring at Mat are refreshing. I still can’t tell if this is a romantic relationship or not. But turns out Mat already did his half of a Seanchean marriage, and Tuon can cash that in at any point.

* Rand: I thought the cleansing of saidin would cure Rand’s dizziness when channeling, but nope he still loses his grip whenever he embraces the power. Love the little detail about unconsciously using the phrases Lews Therin would use. The Seanchean were his biggest enemy in POD so I’m excited to see how that plays out. Also really enjoyed in Cadsuane’s POV chapter that the name Rand doesn’t appear. He is only thought of as “the boy.” Nice little touch of character work on Cadsuane.

* Egwene: Her kidnapping throws a new wrench in the siege plans. The White Tower/rebel showdown has been building for a while now and I really want to see it play out.

**Who I’d Like to See Less Of**

* Elayne: Kind of goes without saying here. I have not enjoyed the Andor stuff so far, and I naively hope it wraps up soon. At least most of the Sea Folk are leaving.

* Mat’s Aes Sedai: These ladies are dumb as fuck. They go out in public knowing the Seanchean control Altara. I mean, I should be used to Aes Sedai arrogance but comes on folks, you’re just asking to get collared.



**Miscellaneous**

* In Perrin’s storyline there is a town that claims the dead are walking. At first the claim that there was a man who disappeared through a wall made me think of gholam. But then Mat has a similar experience with seeing people who are not there, and he has a thought similar to the dead walking. I wonder what this all means.

* Even though I’ve tried to be careful I have been spoiled on some stuff. Some of it was relatively smaller stuff like Nynaeve would marry Lan and Mat would be involved with someone named Tuon (didn’t know she would turn out to be the heir to the Crystal Throne). But recently I got some big stuff spoiled. Encyclopedia WOT usually is good about labelling what book/chapter information comes from but not always. I know a very huge important detail about the Seanchean storyline that I am not supposed to yet. I suppose technically you could puzzle it out if you really read a couple chapters closely but I know if I had not seen a spoiler the reveal of this twist would have totally surprised me. I don’t know when we find out but I know something I shouldn’t, which is a shame because it answers one of the questions that has been bothering me for a while. If you have read the books you can go ahead and make a guess below, BUT make sure you put the correct spoiler tag on. And check back here to see if you are right: I know that [Spoilers All](/s "Semirhage is Anath").

* Above I put forth the question as to whether Crossroads of Twilight deserves its reputation as the worst book in the series. And I would say yeah, probably. But I wouldn’t say it’s bad. The Elayne stuff drags and so does the first crop of Perrin chapters. I have liked what Egwene has done in POD and COT but I can understand why some people don’t like these storylines very much. Echoing my sentiment above, I feel like this is a pivotal book for the series, and sets a lot of threads up for the final strokes. After all, Jordan thought he had only two books to go at this point. I’m sure I will appreciate this book much more once I’ve finished.

* Not a lot of Forsaken action. Maybe they’re licking their wounds after getting curb stomped by Cadsuane and co. I don’t know if the description of Mesaana after Shaidar Haran removes her weave is supposed to give any clues as to her identity in the Tower. Unlike poor Osan’gar who just can’t catch a break, Aran’gar is making up for getting toasted in the first book by doing a whole lot. I’m guessing Halima’s massages are her using saidin to Heal Egwene. We know women can’t tell when saidin is being used. He/she could be using saidin to cause the headaches in the first place. I’d have to double check but is he/she targeting Sisters who are skilled at making cuendillar? With so many Aes Sedai, I don’t always pay attention to which Sisters are doing what.

* What happened on Tremalking?

(Spoilers EotW) New reader’s WoT theories and talk Okay so I’m making another one of these! I hope you guys don’t mind how frequent these are! I just get ideas that pop up super fast!

So I’m about 550 pages in now, almost finished and OH MY GOD! Spoilers if you haven’t read this far!

I cannot believe it! It’s so crazy! I’m on the bit now where Rand is talking to an Ogier, Loial. And I absolutely cannot believe Thom Merrelin died! Gah, it was so heroically cool!
It’s clear he’s not actually dead, though. He’s definitely the male Aes Sedai that was mentioned when Nynaeve, Moiraine and Lan get into Whitebridge! Explains why he has the White Tower floating around him. So much for my theory about him being a Darkfriend, lol!

Also, I’d really like something cleared up if possible without spoilers. Thom’s backstory is that he’s a court bard. The Queen was married to this dude whose wife COINCIDENTALLY died while he wanted to marry the women who would be on the throne. He then fathered two kids before dying. Turns out the Queen was quite taken with Thom but he disappeared to help us nephew Owyn. Because of this, the Queen and her Aes Sedai councillor held it against him.
This is the same Queen we have today, right? So she’s just as old as Thom?

Also Loial mistook Rand for an Aiel which leads me to believe my previous theory of Rand being of Aiel descent is correct, which means Tam was likely involved in a war. Maybe Tam knew of Rand’s importance since the “flame and the void” seems like a means of controlling his Channeling.

Mat seems to have gone really paranoid with the dagger with the ruby on the hilt. Maybe it’s the influence of the dagger on him? Or Mordeth’s influence? The dagger is definitely important considering Min’s vision. And he’s undoubtedly going to get the Great horn in the next one.

Perrin killing two white cloaks was super badass, though I feel really bad for them being in captivity at the moment! Hopefully Elyas didn’t just ditch them! :(

Rand can totally Channel, considering he summoned lightning when he thought he was going to die. He thought about the lantern being safe as the most important thing at that time which leads me to believe he used the lantern as an angreal. He then fell sick 3 days later and recovered in a farmer’s carriage, which leads me to believe it’s the side effects Moiraine spoke of.

Ba’alzamon mentioned the thing that keeps him safe is what keeps him within the sights of the Dark One. Which leads me to believe that him Channeling will only allow Ba’alzamon to keep track of him. Or maybe even draws Rand closer to him due to the taint.

WHO KNOWS! I just cannot wait for everyone to reunite and save Perrin and Egwene!

Please comment your thoughts and I hope you enjoyed!

EDIT: I also forgot one other theory! I think the big trees of life the Ogier mentioned are related to the Aes Sedai’s relationship with the One Power. They’ve chopped down the trees or built over them in places around the world but I believe there’s still one by the Aiel and there’s still one by Tar Valon.
I think these trees give them power to do so many things and Moiraine mentioned the Aes Sedai power used to be way stronger and they used to be able to do wayyyy more.

Looking for ideas for a new epic fantasy series to read. So I basically get the same recommendations from most people when I ask this question so here I am in a place I dont believe I've asked it before.   It's been a little while since I've dug into a big juicy book series and well I'm getting the urge to read something epicly big and beefy again.

So any recommendations for a nice big (atleast 6 books) epic fantasy series?

I've read the big ones that I've heard about over the last 15 years mostly.  My favorite by far of anything is Wheel of time.  I've read Sanderson's stuff since he finished it.  Have read Malazan book of the fallen series, pretty much anything that exists in the dnd universes of forgotten realms, dragon lance, and dark sun.

Feist's Magican and 30 odd following books was a nice long read.  I tried A sword of truth, got 4 books in loved most of those 4 books, 5th was bad and 6th was horrible and ended in the most idiotic way I have ever read and I refused to even think of reading anything more of that series or by him.

I'll be honest and say that I cannot read the Diarrhea Of The Word Processor that is a Song of Ice and Fire... the story is fantastic, I've read the shorter more clifnotesy version of each book and yes the story is fantastic, I just cant ever make my way past some point in book two.  It is simply to much of a slog (I know that sounds strange considering rj could spend 3 chapters describing a closet and anyone in book of the fallen will wax poetic about the human condition be they a god, a human, or a several hundred thousand year old something...)

I've read other stuff over the years but thats the biggest and I'm looking for something new to chew into.  I dont read a massive amount of books but pick up a couple every now and then but every few years I get the urge for something big since my first main read through of wot in about 2001 and now i'm getting that urge again so time to look for something that will take up some time with a few thousand pages of wizards and warlocks and dragons and other things that go boom in the night.

If you made it this far thank you for putting up with my rambling.... that said... any suggestions?

Which Harry Potter house (or pop culture archetype) fits you based on your favourite reads? So I’m new to fantasy so take all this with a pinch of salt, but this is my vibe so far...

Gryffindor: WoT, Stormlight Archive, etc.

Hufflepuff: Dresden Files, Dragonlance, David Gemmell, Harry Potter

Ravenclaw: LotR, NK Jemisin

Slytherin: Malazan, Kingkiller

————

Edit: I would 90% of the time be in Ravenclaw, but I think my fantasy tastes lie towards Gryffindor. As that’s what I’ve read most of. And only a couple of the others. This is very lighthearted!

[Spoilers All] AMoL Review on gizmodo I've recently stumbled upon [this AMoL review on gizmodo](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5975831/the-wheel-of-time-rolls-to-a-stop-io9s-review-of-a-memory-of-light) and though you guys might it. Review itself is quite *good*, but comment section is probably even better. Just a jew examples.

One:
&gt; My basic impression of WoT is that if you're over the age of fourteen and haven't read the first book in the series yet, you will never read these books, ever, even if you really want to.

&gt; (I'm guessing this is an exaggeration on my part, but not by much.)

Two:

&gt; Anyone else have the uneasy feeling that Rand survived because and only because the publishers want a sequel series?

Feel free to share your *favourite* WoT reviews. The more cringeworthy the better.

I Have Void in me and have run out off books to fill it with. so i by no means have read all the books out there i get that, however i really am stumped as to what to read now. so far i have read Malazan, Traitor son Cycle (amazing), basically Sandorson's stuff (amazing), WOT, Kingkiller, Lies of locksomething or other, Eragon (when it was hip)

i love long series with character development. any Suggestion would be greatly appreciate, have a nice day

is WoT for me? Started reading and I'm almost done the first book but I'm noticing its already a bit slower than I'm used to and some of the characters are already kinda annoying. The guys all act like idiots and Nynaeve just annoys me. I hear it gets way slower as the books go on where there's little to no action or progression. I mostly started because I like Brandon Sanderson and was looking forward to the final books that he wrote. Should I bother continuing?

Uncannily Ogier in Methuselas Children. I'm a huge Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke fan, and so recently I've been rereading Heinlein's Future History books. In "Methuselas Children," when they (spoilers for a 50 year old book completely unrelated to WOT) when they arrive at their new planet, the description of the indigenous people is quite... familiar.

&gt;The pictures had shown bipeds seven to eight feet tall, unilaterally symmetric, possessed of internal skeletal framework, distinct heads, lens-and-camera eyes.  Those eyes were their most human and appealing features; they were large, about the size of a saucer, lipid, and tragic, like those of a Saint Bernard dog.

Maybe Jordan had some sort of minor inspiration, I dunno. So strange though! What do you think?

[All] Which Podcast is best to listen after reading? I finished The Wheel of Time maybe a year ago and have been reading through Sanderson's work since then.

I recently decided I wanted to listen to some WoT podcasting and it turns out there are a number of good ones, a lot of them quite extensive.

I dont think I'll be listening to multiple podcasts on the series, which one do you all think is best? At a quick browse it looks like "The wheel of time Spoilers podcast" and " the Legendarium Podcast" have the two most popular ones. I listend to episode 1 of both of those and it seems the spoilers podcast may be better for post reading, and I can save Legendarium for a possible re read?

Just finished my first reread. And I realized why I'd avoided rereading the series for so long. It's too good. I stopped reading for months after the first time, and I almost want to do it again. Other fantasy books just don't seem as good when you have this to compare them to. This time I realized that I need more from the WoT universe. Does anyone know how likely it is that RJ's notes will be published?  Or that anything at all will be created in this universe ever again?

Just finished a re-read of The Chronicles of the Black Company by Glen Cook Hoo, boy. That was a doozy. Absolutely love this whole series of his, enough so I even did a re-read, which is rare for me! I found myself remembering certain parts or conclusions, only to realize how much I had missed by the time I got there. So many memorable moments in the series! From the Battle at Charm in which a quarter-million men died, to the White Rose taking Oar in the fight against the Limper, to the world of the Hsien and Cat Sith and company, or the imagery of the resting place of Kina and the cave of ancients...I absolutely loved every bit. This was a great reminder in how much I love the grimdark military side of fantasy. That being said, to the few readers (surprise me?) of this series as well, I would love to hear some of your favorite moments! We can even trade quotes. Also, would love further recommendations--I've already read many of the usual suspects such as MBotF, WoT, Sword of Truth, etc. Also planning on bouncing on back into some of Peter F Hamilton's scifi before coming back to fantasy, but I'd love to hear it!

Soldiers live. And wonder why.

I'm just starting, and I've heard some mixed things I am 6 hours (of 35) through Wizard's First Rule. Richard, Khalan, and Zed have collected the sword and met up with Boundary Warden Chase.

I am loving the book so far. One of the moments that i loved was when Richard (being a woods' guide) noticed that there were no spider webs hitting him in the face,  and that warned him. I never would have thought of that kind of detail, and i was impressed with that level of detail.

Anyways, I've heard a couple of opinions and have a concern. I realize that this subreddit will be biased,  but i was hoping for input. As a side note, i searched Reddit for "wizard's first rule the sword of truth" and it didn't bring me here,  but rather showed me Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, South Park: The Stick of Truth threads. A big thank you to Google for finding your subreddit.

Opinion #1 was "only the first few books in the series are the amazing ones, then the series gets bad."

Opinion #2 was that the series has "a bunch of gratuitous rape and torture."

My concern is over the narrators on audible. How are they? I've never had to switch narrators a bunch while listening to a single series.

To influence your replies, so far i have listened to:

A song of ice and fire by George R R Martin

The stormlight archives and the mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson

The wheel of time by Robert Jordan - everyone said WoT gets bad after book 6 until book 11 but i only disliked book 10 Crossroads of Twilight.

What's your recommendation? Are those criticisms real? How are the narrators really?

Finished first read of WoT So last night, after almost two years, I completed my first reading of the entire WoT series. When I first embarked on reading the series, I was definitely concerned about the length, I had never read such a long continuous series previously.

Even through the slow books, I was enjoying the depth of the world building and political developments.

Obviously there were some portions of the series I didn’t particularly enjoy, such as some sections with Elayne’s point of view, I was clearly impressed with how our main characters, in particular Nynaeve, grew throughout the series.

After Crossroads of Twilight, and getting through some of the slower books, I was definitely glad the pace of the story increased.

I believe the key to me finishing the series, especially the slower moving books, was that I was reading other books in between books. That helped break it up, and I’m not sure I would’ve made it doing one continuous read.

After a few years, perhaps I will reread the series, but overall, I was very impressed with the Wheel of Time overall, and I’m glad I took the time to read it.

[No Spoilers] How could Amazon produce WOT when they just dropped a billion on The Lord Of The Rings? How will the show survive if it’s budget isn’t higher than Game Of Throne? I mean, are we 100% sure Amazon is producing this? We’ve only heard it once, and that was at the end of an article. How could they have 2 of the most influential book series under them, and casually drop a billion on one without ever mentioning the other?


If we were to do the nonsensical math, wouldn’t it go along these lines :

5 seasons of LOTR = 1 Billion $

We can expect the budget of each season to increase of course. (Comparing it with GOT’s budget, I feel like it’d be a bit more balanced out than what I wrote. I guess season 1 would have a bigger budget, and season 5 and 4 a smaller one.)

Season 1 : 50M
Season 2 : 150M
Season 3 : 200M
Season 4 : 250M
Season 5 : 350M

(Woah, I’m probably way off looking a bit more into it.)

Now let’s compare it to GOT (I can’t get any info on the cost per season except for season 8, 6, 2 and 1 so I’ll go with some guesses.)  :

Season 1 : 60M
Season 2 : 69M
Season 3 : 73M (?)
Season 4 : 75M (?)
Season 5 : 75M (?)

Total : 352
————————-
Season 6 : 60M
Season 7 : 80M (?)
Season 8 : 90M

And they still had to cut out some CGI in season 6/7 because it didn’t fit their budget (If you’ve watched the series, you’ll know what/who’s missing.) I’m also missing the cost of season 3, 4 and 5, so I made some guesses. (Season 6 apparently cost 60M? I’m not sure which seasons I got wrong, since the numbers came from different sources.)

How will WOT compete with these if the 3 big ones won’t produce it?

It will have more CGI than GOT, but less than LOTR in the first 4 seasons and for season 5 (book 5) it might have more CGI.

Theoretical perfect budget if we compare it to the other two :

Season 1 (Book 1)  : 63M (You got the trollocs, the ———-, the ————-, the ——————- and the ————————- , already way more CGI needed than GOT, but it doesn’t have ——— compared to GOT.)

Season 2 (Book 2) : 70M (You got the huge ———, the stones and the last chapters.)

Season 3 (Book 3) : 75M  ( I don’t need to explain this one, right?)

Season 4 (Book 4) : 80M (I don’t remember 4 much, maybe around 77-78M?)

Season 5 (Book 5) : 80M (Might be a bit more, but I did the same thing with season 4/5 of GOT.)

Total : 368M

Before you come complaining that they’ll probably cut stuff and that book 1 and 2 will be one season, that just means that The Lord Of Chaos would be season 5. Dumai’s Well anyone?

If you think the budget is way too high (probably is), then imagine how much marketing WOT will need to even compete with GOT and LOTR.

Are we fucked?

EDIT : I wrote this all on mobile, so I got no idea how to spoiler tag certain things, so I just didn’t mention them.

If WoT were converted to a TV/Movie, how would you set up the show/movie series? Including the potential for a miniseries (Note: most minisiries are just a few episodes long but east episode tends to be about a standard movie's length, of 1.5 to 2hrs.)

Each episode / movie should have a concise plot where you have an 'ending' point. The only issue I have with this myself is if you do it in movie style, you would likely have a lot of content gutted. Imagine the initial group fleeing the Two Rivers never seeing Baerlon!

However if we do it in a series it'd be a little more difficult to get each episode to have some kind of conclusion, though the later books would greatly benefit from this (the ability to show simultaneous scenes with Perrin, [](/s "Faile"), Mat, Rand, etc in their own respective arcs) it'd take *forever* to get there. If you had one season be one book, we wouldn't be done for *fourteen years!*

Wheel of Time - Breaking point? It looks like the WoT subreddits are dead. So I brought this question to the best place I could think of. Please direct me somewhere else if I need to be.

I'm about a third of the way into the first book of the Wheel of Time series. I was told by many people that it is a great read, especially if you like the Sword of Truth series.

So far it's not ensnaring me so my question is when does it start to pick up or when is a good time to say "if you aren't into it by now, you probably won't be."

I know some books are different, for example, SoT had me on the first book, Dresden had me after around book 3 or 4. So where is the "three-episode-rule" for this series? I planned on at least finishing the first book but if it doesn't snag me should I continue?


EDIT: Reddit search dropped me in /r/wheeloftime and /r/wheeloftimeseries, sorry /r/wot!

LOTR - just fairy tales? Yesterday, I stopped by a used book store that I hadn't realized was just around the corner. I'm reading through the WoT series (just finishing book 3), and wanted to see if they had books 4 &amp; 5. Success! Books purchased!

The clerk asked me if I read much fantasy, and I said that yes, I've read quite a bit over the years (including STP, GGK, GRRM, Rothfuss, Pern - does this count as Fantasy? - in High School I read most of Tamora Pierce's Tortall universe and Anthony's Xanth books, and of course, LotR). It all started for me when my mom read me and my brother The Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings. I was hooked, and I said as much. The clerk pooh-poohed LotR and said, 'oh yes, well, that's just fairy tales'.

I was actually kind of insulted on Tolkein's behalf. While I haven't read the LotR as an adult, and I know he didn't write the scope of what many other authors do (WoT is a huge series!), I don't think it should be considered any less than current works. Didn't he basically start the whole Fantasy genre? (Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under that impression.) It's hardly fair to call his tale 'children's stories'. Sure he got hung up on some details, and was a linguist who decided to write a story, but the way he said it was just so lacking in any respect.

[Spoiler Book 5] I've just finished reading TFoH and I keep sharing my renewed opions on characters so far. Link to my commentary of TSR: https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/879hae/spoiler_book_4_i_just_finished_reading_tsr_and_i/

After the epic read of TSR, I found TFoH a little wanting, in particular the middle part and the battles that were supposed to be huge, but were instead resolved in too few pages. Even though the "boring" parts I read it particularly fast, as I wanted to discover more and see what happens.

Rand: It is now sure and he is a leader, he has power, he has armies and followers. His mere existence is reshaping the world and at least now we know more of his objective. Restore peace and find whatever help he can. He learns new things thanks to Asmodean and his inner Lewis Therin, and he struggles to keep his identity and sanity.
In this book he finally admits he is a manipulator, he needs to use people and does not hide it anymore.
I like the relationship with Aviendha, it's tense at moments, but there is always a tender and cute unspoken side.
Why the fudge does he keep all these Darkfriends close? He knew of Kadere, Isendre and the peddlers company and still kept them close so they could spy on him. Bad move Rand, bad move. Asmodean was understandable, but why Kadere and co.?
The battle in Cairhien was dull. Little action and Rand fainting, it's a formula we have already seen. It's as if Jordan wrote "hey a lot of cool things are happening, but let's just skip ahead and let me narrate them after I've described how cool Aiels are dressed".

Mat: Same point as Rand. Cool things happening, but let's just skip ahead. Mat is a character that keeps growing esponentially, and my love for him, too. The randomness of his actions, the randomness of what happens to him is fun. He is the most unpredictable and he ends up leading an army and winning a battle while trying to escape. Pure random! He keeps canoodling (his term) with dangerous girls. They always happen to be Darkfriends! By the way, was the red twisted door profecy of his death referring to him dying to Ravhin or to his hanging in Rhuidean? *Dice rolling*

Perrin: sad he was not in this book, but at least we know he's doing well and probably building something in Edmond Field.

Egwene: still in the hands of the Old Ones, she at least is a lot of use for information sharing. A bit of character development has she is finally bully Nynaeve around, but my love still goes to the latter. I read too many hints that she will become the new Amyrlin Seat (Perrin dreamed of her surrounded by Aes Sedai kneeling, Siaun and co. discussing they need a new leader strong in power and not present during Elaida coup d'etat), and I think I may like it.

Nynaeve: still my favourite, a little more present in this book. While her chapters were the slowest ones (too many chapters of them joining the managerie, dresses, braids tugging, sniffing...) she also had a few of the most interesting ones. Her on-going battle with Moghedein, she is scared but also angry, but still manages to get things done. And she brought Birgitte! I love Birgitte! Also, she had Moghedein on a leash, and for the few pages of LoC I have read, she still has her there. Hopefully she will learn a lot about Healing stilling and about the a'dame. The Nynaeve-Siaun duo is the most beautiful couple of the book (Rand-Aviendha who?).

Elayne: still trusting anyone who comes at range, raising her chin, being stubborn and being hateful. I still despise this character. At least I am thankful she saved Birgitte.

Moraine, o Moraine: Light burn me, I actually felt bad for her. Her character developed a lot, she changed for the best, even if it was because of the future she saw. She sacrifaced herself and chose for the best future for Rand. I want to believe she is not dead, but just lost in an alternative world. Poor Lan, I feel you. But now maybe you might meet Nynaeve again. Also, her explanation of balefire was fascinating. "Don't use it!" *Rand procedes to balefire the shit out of everything. I want balefire to have more drawbacks, because as now it only brought positive stuff. (I expected Rand to save Mat, Aviendha and Asmodean with it, what a cheap tool it is).

Lanfear: 3 Forsakens dying in his book and only Lanfear was an actual danger. She took one of the main characters with her at least. I'm still wondering how she doesn't know who Aviendha is. Everybody knew she slept with Rand, and eveybody knew she was an Aiel. I guess Lanfear was stupid enough to not tell which one between Egwene and Aviendha was an Aiel.

Min, Siuan, Logain: what a wonderful trio. Min with her power, Siuan with her strong character, trying to bully and control full Aes Sedai, and Logain being prophetized with a great future of glory. I wonder how much I have to wait to see them in action.

I felt sorry for Asmodean, I had the feeling he was turning to be a good guy. He dealt a pact with the Dark One just for his art. How cute.

Gareth Bryne is a badass. He managed to impose his conditions on Aes Sedai. I want to read more of him.

Morgase: Same as her daughter. At least she has Lini who is a words of wisdom dispenser.

I have already started reading LoC and hopefully it will be a little faster than TFoH.

Ask me of any characters if I forgot any :)

So I have an experience to share about what I was reading and what I am reading now. I am about 3/4 through Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson. For those that don't know this is the second book of the Stormlight Archive.

Anyway I was in my book room and Gardens of the Moon is set on a display shelf almost calling to me, I planned on diving into malazan once I was finished with the current SA books.
Despite this I was curious because I hear absolutely nothing but good things about the Malazan books so I decided to read the first few pages and see how it feels.

Now I'm about 120 pages into GotM and it's just brilliant. The huge scale and scope of the story and the sense of danger at every moment.
The battle of the pale was just juicy and bloody and gory. This is like dark souls in book form, this feels like the epicness of wot combined with the drama and goryness from ASoIaF with a little bit more emphasis on the larger better scenery.

Looks like the SA is gonna have to wait I'm going all in on this.

We are the Aiel (some spoilers) As I sit here being ready for work tonight and listening to ToM again as I work, a thought came to me about when/if a TV show of Wheel of Time comes out.

There will be people who have not read/listened to the books, who will only engage WoT though the show.   Some will pursue it deeper and read, but many will not, feeling they already know all there is needed to know about WoT by what is on the show alone.

We are the Aiel, who have pushed our way through the books and who continually return to them out of love.  We spent the years in the Waste waiting for the next book and through the loss of Jordan.  Much as the Cairhien tried to copy Ji'e'toh, these show fans will copy us.

WoT Reading Diary - The Dragon Reborn first 1/3 (Spoilers TDR) I'm back with my reading diary for the first third of The Dragon Reborn.

...The gang seems to be hiding out in th wilderness for some reason. Min kissed Perrin on the cheek so maybe they'll be a thing?

...RIP Edema Ruh lady. I guess we should trust Min to know when someone is in danger huh?

...We just met a wolf-talker who went full wolf. Hopefully Perrin doesn't go the same way. Maybe he'll find out how Elyas was able to keep being relatively normal.

...Rand seems like he's gone off the deep end. He's going to Tear to get this special prophecy-sword.

...Nynaeve and Egwene get to be detectives and root out the Black Ajah. Cool! These blank checks from the Amyrlin are some major Chekov's guns.

...For all her supposed dedication to Rand, Egwene sure spends a lot of time thinking about Galad. And apparently, Elayne says Gawyn is besotted with Egwene. Love triangle between Egwene, Galad and Gawyn brewing?

...Man, the internet wasn't kidding when they said Jordan used the phrase "Tugged her braid" a lot.

...The Aes Sedai are healing Mat now. He's shouting more of the old tongue. I'm getting an Exorcist vibe.

...The logo at the start of Mat's chapter is some dice, lol. Dude loves his gambing.

...Lanfear is back, talking to Mat. If one of the Forsaken ones can just walk in to the white tower, then the Aes Sedai security kind of sucks doesn't it?

...Egwene's test is happening. Egwene just came out of the second door and told everyone that the Dark One was trying to turn "him" (Rand) to the Shadow. Sheriam is talking about how people who can channel are susceptible to the dark. Does this mean Sheriam knows about Rand?

...Verin told Egwene that the ring terangreal was associated with the dream world, and now Alanna is saying that the "reverberation" thing with the three arches angreal has only happened before when two related angreal are used in the same room! So the three arches terangreal must be related to the dream world as well!

[Spoilers TDR] I'm halfway through The Shadow Rising, could someone answer a few quick questions about the Children of the Light and religious beliefs in WoT without spoilers, please? Okay, so I'm halfway through The Shadow Rising and I love it so much. I'm deeply immersed in the world and I think I'm doing a pretty good job of following along with all the plotlines. However, I feel like any time I read something about the Children of the Light, I'm completely lost. I always mix up Bornhald and Jaret Byar and I think there might be another Bornhald? Also I feel like I'm very unclear on what exactly they are and what they believe.

So my questions are:

1. Who exactly are the Children of the Light? Are they a religious group?
2. At this point of TSR (last CotL thing I read was Carridin in Tanchico first being visited by Liandrin) what exactly are their goals? Can anyone offer a quick summary of what the CotL have done in the first three books? Or point me to where I can read about that spoiler free?

Thinking about this led me to another question. Is there religion in WoT? Nobody ever seems to mention gods or goddesses or worship of any sort except for a few people mentioning the Creator. What exactly is the Light? Who is the Creator? People don't seem to have any sort of cultural rituals around these concepts yet everyone knows about them.

is there any sort of religion in this world? Its absence seems really strange, especially given how much detail every other aspect of this world has and how diverse the various cultures are. Why does nobody seem to have any belief in higher powers?

If the answers involve spoilers please let me know and don't spoil! I've been really good about not spoiling myself for most things.

Thanks!

My 2018 The Wheel of Time reading mission - Part 1: The Eye of the World (Spoilers) So this year, looking for an epic fantasy series to dive into after finishing Oathbringer and getting tired of waiting for GRRM and Rothfuss, I thought I'd start a series that was actually finished. For some reason I never had gotten around to WoT, partly due to the massive commitment required to finish 14 700+ page books, and also partly due to being scared off by people saying it goes through a serious lull in the middle.

But as luck would have it, I found the entire 14-book series for $40 in my local Goodwill so I thought why the hell not? I'll read through it gradually and see how I like it.

So I just recently finished The Eye of the World, and I have to say - so far, so good. I really enjoyed the first instalment, even though it's pretty clear that this is more of just a prologue to a much bigger story. I can definitely see the LoTR comparisons as the structure and even the characters very closely mirror that of Fellowship of the Ring. However, the worldbuilding so far has been pretty great even though I'm not sure if I'm a huge fan of the whole "chosen one" trope. One thing I do like is that even though Rand is supposed to be the Dragon Reborn, the whole concept isn't treated as some heroic messiah thing, but with more fear and trepidation.

I also liked the treatment of the main characters as well. None of them are particularly heroic or goody-two-shoes-ish, as a lot of fantasy ensemble casts tend to be. I especially liked that how aloof and distant Perrin was portrayed as. There are some great set pieces like Shadar Logoth and the escape from Two Rivers covered in fog.

Female characters need a little bit more work though. Egwene is a solid character, but I cannot stand Nynaeve and really was hoping she'd get rek'd by a Trolloc or something. Moiraine is good, although it's hard to say since she was made to be kind of mysterious and unknowable.

My main issue was with the pacing as it moved very slow during some parts. The lore and worldbuilding was still there though and that made me push through, although I could've done without the excessive dream sequences. Ba'alzamon is a pretty interesting villain so far though and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him.

So overall, I felt TEotW to be a very solid beginning to what I'm hoping is an epic reading experience. It had some issues but there's enough good here for me to continue on. I'd give this one a 7.5/10. I'm currently about 100 pages into The Great Hunt and it's already starting off with a lot more energy. Will post about that when I'm done!

Started the audiobooks and am remembering how great WoT is. I read the books up to almost the last that Jordan penned himself but not all of them years ago but never finished if. I got to [spoiler] (/s “Rand got his hand bale fired off”) and no further. I remember enjoying them but got busy and that was that. I had an Audible credit and picked up Eye of the World and oh boy is it good. I had forgotten so much!

Bingo Review: Dreaming in the Dark, edited by Jack Dann **The book**

*Dreaming in the Dark* is an anthology celebrating the current Golden Age of Australian speculative fiction. The 21 stories are a mix of science fiction, horror, fantasy, magical realism and everything in between. It also won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology in 2017.

[Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35394718-dreaming-in-the-dark)

**Review**

The book starts on a high note with Sean Williams' *Sing, My Murdered Darlings*, an intense tale about matter transmission booths and two hackers in a deadly competition.

Switching gears completely, the next story is *Falling Angel* about a man in love with a fallen angel. I loved the prose and the storytelling in this one.

James Bradley's *Martian Triptych* is really a trio of vignettes, all centering around the human fascination with Mars. The scope is impressive for a short story, starting in the early 20th century and ending billions of years in the future.

*Northerner's Farewell* by Rjurik Davidson shares a setting with his novel *Unwrapped Sky*, which is great because this story left me wanting to learn more about this world.

Terry Dowling's *Midnight in the Graffiti Tunnel* is an excellent urban fantasy story about magical graffiti, in which the protagonist has to face down his childhood bully.

Lisa L. Hannett's *A Right Pretty Mate*, about the mating rituals of sentient harpies, is one of the more lighthearted stories in the book, but also doesn't shy away from deeper themes.

Jason Nahrung's *Eromon No More* is set in an alternate high fantasy Australia with some influences from the Western genre. It's a story about two former fighters getting caught up in the war they think they've escaped from and has a cool system of nature magic.

*Luv Story* by Kim Westwood is the first story in the anthology that I didn't enjoy. Essentially, it's a post-apocalyptic retelling of Adam and Eve, completely written in some kind of "future dialect" that made it incredibly hard to get through. "Ime gonna tell you this wun story made ov truth n lies. Not becos I meen to, but thass wot memry is." Yuck.

Sean McMullen's *The Luminarium Tower* is a return to form however, a magical story about a goblin artisan who has to build a giant observatory for a king obsessed with beauty, that could be straight from One Thousand and One Nights. Easily one of my favorites.

*Neither Time Nor Tears* by Angela Slatter is another standout, about a woman who inherits her grandmother's house and discovers some dark parts of her family history. Amazing storytelling.

Richard Harland's *A Shining Day* is a deceptively dark tale about a family attending a village festival on a holiday in Greece. The final twist was a bit too predictable, but I still enjoyed the story.

*The Liquid Palace* by Adam Browne is a surreal tale about the crew of a spaceship(?) made from the eye of a fish(?) exploring a museum(?) to do something(?). I generally like a little bit of surrealism, but to be honest something about the prose made it incredibly difficult to parse any sort of meaning from this story.

*Heat Treatment* by Venero Armanno is a horror story about post partum OCD and unfortunately another miss for me. This might be partially down to me not being a huge fan of horror anyway, but it just somehow felt unpolished.

Rosaleen Love's *Snowflakes All the Way Down* has a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting where failed attempts to stop global warming have turned plankton into new bionic creatures called snowflakes. The story is about three very different characters who travel to the island of Abonya, to find out why it has been differently affected by the snowflakes.

Alan Baxter's *Served Cold* is the story of a teenage boy who with the help of a ghost gets revenge on his abusive stepfather. Not bad, just somewhat generic.

Next up is the main reason why I picked this book up, Anna Tambour's story *The Dog Who'd Been Dead*. Anna Tambour is one of my favorite authors and I'll read pretty much anything she publishes. Her work is consistently brilliant, filled with unique ideas and luscious prose. Luckily this excellent (but woefully short) story about a dog who's bored of the afterlife and decides to return to its owners is no exception.

*Fade to Grey* by Janeen Webb is a horrifying (in a good way) story about a retired journalist who encounters a group of ghosts who task her with exposing the person responsible for their deaths.

Garth Nix's *All Those Superpowers and What Are They Good For?* is a fun take on superheroes, if a bit too short.

I'm usually not a big fan of fairy tale retellings, but Kirstyn McDermott's bittersweet retelling of Hansel and Gretel is an exception to that. *Burnt Sugar* imagines what happened to the two after they returned to their father from Gretel's perspective and it's brilliant.

Kim Wilkins' *In Hornhead Wood* a story of a man returning to his childhood home next to a mysterious forest is a bit of an oddball. I enjoyed the story itself, but just couldn't shake the feeling that it seemed to be made up of parts that I've read before.

The last story in the book, Simon Brown's *Moonshine*, is a worthy conclusion to *Dreaming in the Dark*. A vaguely noir-ish tale about a pair of whiskey smugglers running moonshine from Canada to Detroit during prohibition who get attacked by mysterious creatures.

*Dreaming in the Dark* is a massive sampler of many different styles and genres, and while not every story worked for me I also found plenty to love in there. I came away from it with a list of new authors to check out in the future, and I'm pretty sure the variety in this anthology guarantees that there's something for everyone there.

Opinion on Witcher Series Hi folks, I am new to reddit and love the conversations on this group. Had a question on Witcher series which I wanted an opinion on, I’ve read reviews for lot of other series but what is your opinion on Witcher? I am currently finishing WoT and wanted suggestion on what to pick next. Have recently started reading again but have read Harry Potter, GoT and LOTR in the past.

Cosmere Universe Reading Order I’m in the process of making my way through the Wheel of Time for the very first time. I’m planning on using books 13 and 14 as a subtle introduction to Sanderson, and moving into the Cosmere afterward (before a second round with WoT). Sanderson has said it doesn’t matter which Cosmere series you start with, but I want to make sure I’m getting the most out of the universe. What would you all recommend? I was thinking to simply go with publication order (Elantris, Mistborn Trilogy, Warbreaker, Way of Kings, etc...).

Whos your least favorite main character? Spoilers I'm almost done w my first read though, it's been about 16-18 months and wot has done so much for me. It's gotten me back into reading (in general, but more importantly into fiction and fantasy) I forgot how much I love a good story with well fleshed out characters.

My question is: who's your least favorite main character? Mine honestly has to be Eylane. RJ (and BS to an extent) does a superb job of really fleshing out the characters and making them all seem real. I especially think he does a magnificent job (as a 28 year old man-boy) of writing powerful women MC's.

But Eylane to me just doesn't really grow that much, (I'm 1/3rd of the way through MOL :'( and I just don't see her having THAT much more growth w what's left of the books) to me she's still the spoiled girl. Yes she adeptly takes the Lion Throne and has a badass warder, and is badass in her own right w the one power. But I feel like everyone else has large transformations, and really grows into themselves throughout the story. She's not a bad character by any means, just compared to the others, she's a little lacking.

Maybe my opinion of her character growth is jaded bc she's my least favorite character idk. Interested to hear y'all's thoughts. IM NOT DONE W THE BOOK SO PLEASE DONT GIVE SHIT AWAY.

New fantasy series needed So I'm curious about mark lawrence, has anyone read any of his stuff? I'm almost done w WOT series, it's been a great 16 months, but alas it's about over. While it's been a great ride and has reignited my love for fiction, and fantasy in general.

 I need a new series, obviously I was looking into Brandon Sanderson books. I do plan on reading some of his original work, just wanted to hear y'all thoughts on mark Lawrence.

Or who are some of your favorite fantasy authors? I'm def looking for a new series to sink my teeth into, but would read a standalone as well, if it strikes me fancy.

I just started my annual re-read of WoT and Like the titel says, i've just started my annual re-read of WoT. I read the whole series whenever a book got released, and in the years without a release, i read them anyway. This series is so much a part of me and my youth growing up. I can't really say how much i've read eye of the world. It's definitely been more than 30 times.
I'm now at the part where they're running from Baerlon. And i'm every bit engrossed in the story like i was 20 years ago. Although my growing up gives me a different perspective on some story lines, it always feels like the Two Rivers is welcoming me home.
I still get goosebumps from some Parts. I still get teary eyes when moraine tells the sad story of brave Manetheren, even if i could Tell it myself by rote.

I've read a lot of fantasy. And i won't pretend Jordan didnt have writing flaws.

But i would like to thank him anyway for creating a story, THE story, that will last me my entire life.

Open letter about Special Effects in TWoT TV series Dear directors of the show,
I believe I speak for all fans when I say that the easiest way to make fantasy cheesy is with bad special effects.  No matter how large your budget is now that you have made a deal with Amazon, constant usage of CGI glowing gets obnoxious very quickly.  So I kindly ask that you avoid the following when presenting magic.

1. NO CONSTIPATION FACES.  I mean it! We are NOT stupid! If Egwene is staring intently at the Seanchan soldiers while spreading her arms, we can tell that crap is gonna go down. Don't ruin it by making her look like she can only Channel while pushing out a turd.

2. No Dragon Ball Z auras.  Gentle shines around a woman are fine though.  Anything else and they go from having a Power ranking of 8(+5) to a Power level of over nine thousand.  Also please be courteous about sound effects.  Choose something that DOESN'T involve a loud wind tunnel noise.

3. Good and evil color schemes.  When channeling the OP for women, the colors of the weave are already stated by RJ: Red for fire, blue for water, yellow for air, green for earth and white for spirit.  Please, *please* don't turn this into a Harry Potter style wand-laser battle.  My heart won't have enough strength to see you guys degrade the OP into just "Gold=good/Black is evil || Red is good/green is evil."  The black Ajah and Dread-lords have the same colors for their weaves as an Aes Sedai who walks in the Light.  True Power can be your evil looking lasers but leave the True Source untouched by the Taint on Saidirector.

Now that we've gone over the No-No's, let's talk about all the creative liberty that can be taken!

1. Aes Sedai appearance and agelessness.  I imagine this as having faces with with a shiny look from lots of contour.

2. Seanchan animals. They're cool.  Have some fun making puppets, costumes or some crappy CGI. You can use CGI but I will always love me some Henderson style puppets.

3. Time/space continuum and its impact on the Wheel.  Some of my favorite scenes in WoT so far (of what I have read) are the Portal Stone dimensions.  You either have cool physics and imagery or you have alternate universe scene which are always a treat.

*Flicker.*

 Now we're at #40. Min's Viewings.  See how quickly we got through these?  These I feel should be done as floating, impressionist painted images of the things she sees.  They could be integrated seamlessly into the scene so that it looks (from Min's perspective at least) to be a thing in the room that no one notices save for her.  Then we see that it has a painting like look to it that you don't notice from far away.

My ideas are just a few thoughts from a little asian boy who just got into this fandom.  Who knows what'll happen once the show gets going; the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.

Light Illumine you,
u/Kaladinner

What are the obvious must read books of the last couple of years? Haven't been keeping up with fantasy lately.

My favourites are WoT (easy #1) and Dresden Files, Sanderson's and Abercrombie's stuff is great too. Picked up Oathbringer expecting a great book, was astonished by how horribly it betrayed my expectations. Thought I'd better come by for some recommendations.

The last book of the series... not so fast. Just finished book 3 of the Shattered Sands series, which I think is a great series, but I thought it was a trilogy as had been described online and set my expectations for book 3 accordingly; all right finally get this one wrapped up and don’t have to keep track of another series. As I’m getting closer to the end I’m realizing that there is no way everything can wrap up in time. Start doing further research and find out this is now a 6 book series!

Similar thing happened with the Light bringer series.

On the good side it means more of the characters I enjoy but on the other I feel robbed of that conclusion I thought was coming.

Any other examples? I know Sanderson did that with extending WOT.

What fantasy book/series has made you feel the most connected to the characters? For me the first one that comes to mind is Wheel of Time. Say what you will about the series, but few can make me feel like I am facing things side by side with the characters like WoT does. From the first book I felt like I cared for them and by the end of the series I never really wanted to let them go. I do think nostalgia and the longevity of the series could play a part in my feelings though.

Second to mind? Robin Hobb is an author that never fails to make me care, mostly because she is so cruel to her characters! Stop hurting them please! And yet I can't stop reading and loving every moment of it.

What about you?

Recently returned to the fantasy genre after a long hiatus (&gt;15 years) and I must admit I'm disappointed. I used to read fantasy almost exclusively as a child/young adult and kind of got away from it into my late teens and early twenties.

Anyway so my friend is crazy about this show Game of Thrones so she asked me to read the ASOIAF series with her.  I really enjoyed it.  This reminded me how much I used to love fantasy when I was a kid so I checked out this sub and r/fantasy and picked up a few of the more popular names on the lists.  So far I have read:

- Stormlight Archive: First two books

- Mistborn: First book

- Kingkiller Chronicles: First book

- Wheel of Time: Books 1 - 7 (currently on eight)

Well I have to admit, I'm sorely disappointed.  I found all of these books to be really low quality in a lot of aspects.  The only books I've really enjoyed so far are the Stormlight Archive ones.  I will continue to read SA because I enjoy the story but I found the characters to be extremely one-dimensional and the author has a huge problem with the "show don't tell rule".  For example Shallan is supposed to be super smart but she never does or says anything I would consider even remotely clever.  We are just supposed to believe she's smart because everybody around her says she is.  Also the books just read like children's books and I find when the author is trying to write a "cool" character (like Szeth) it ends up just coming across really cringey and lame.  A lot of the plot points were really cringey and forced as well.

Mistborn was almost unreadable for me - the main character is the worst Mary Sue I have ever encountered.  Kingkiller Chronicles I thought also had a problem with "show don't tell" (and the story was extremely boring - barely anything happened). And Wheel of Time - this is the one that is making me reconsider my choice to get back into this genre - is so unbelievably basic.  I despise all the characters, the writing isn't that great, the story is so tropey and predictable.  And while the story is definitely detailed and I notice a lot of foreshadowing etc., I'm disappointed with the caliber of conversation it sparks in the community vs. something like ASOIAF.  For example I posted recently about how a certain character often uses fish similes.  I expected there to be some good imagery or something surrounding the repeated theme of fish and this character - but no the community (very excitedly) explained to me it's because the character grew up in a fishing village.  I mean seriously that's it? For contrast ask the ASOIAF community about some minor detail in the book and at least you will get some more marginally sophisticated answers.  Inb4 this is a community thing and ASOIAF is live while WoT isn't, but for the amount of gushing about that book in r/wot I just find the caliber of conversation and analysis to be really superficial.

So yeah call me a negative nancy but I think I'm going to finish Wheel of Time and then forget about this genre for good.  I enjoyed it as a teen but for adult me, the cringe factor is too high.

Edit: Formatting

[QUESTION] Dealing with an unlikable protagonist So I'm about 80% of the way done the first draft of my novel, although of course this last 20% is taking more time than the first 80%.

It's a first-person story, here's the basic premise, it is set in the present day world:

Six months ago the world found out magic was real. Carl, a magical school dropout, accidentally summons a monster that possesses a nearby girl. Can he remove the demon from her while evading magical authorities, the local police and a relentless demon bounty hunter?

The problem I'm running into is that for various reasons, my main character is a huge liar. He lies to deal with any situation that he can, and he is actually compelled to do it magically without his knowledge. But as the reader is in his head and he's the narrator, the reader sees all his lies, but don't know about him being magically compelled as he has no idea.

The problem with that is that he comes off as a huge coward and overall douche for the majority of the book (because he is), until we find out why he does it.

My current idea to deal with this is to switch to 3rd person and bring in two more POV characters, specifically the possessed girl and a cop that is pursuing them. This would allow the reader to not know when Carl is lying (as we will be in the other POV when he does it), and to make it a reveal that he's untrustworthy instead of something we know from the beginning. Hopefully the reveal can then be tempered with WHY he lies and then he can become something people empathize with.

Was wondering if anyone had any examples of a character they didn't like that became better that I could study for ideas, my best example would be Mat Cauthon from WoT, who went from my least favourite character to my favourite over the course of the series.

Conclusion? I'm new here, so I dont know if this has been discussed before or not. I just finished WMF, and I'm wondering if he'll be able to finish it with Day Three. I feel like there's so much story left unsaid. Feels a bit like Jordan saying WoT was going to be a trilogy, although I highly doubt this would turn in 14 books

Dumai's Wells on first read (Minimal spoilers) I'm on my first read through (well, read and listen). I've lurked around r/wot a bit and heard of the Battle of Dumai's Wells and how awesome it was. But I had no idea when it happens. When the first mention of Dumai's Wells occurred in LoC, I got extremely excited. I just finished the chapter and...holy hell. I see why so much is made of it. Such an awesome chapter. The asha'man, Perrin and Loial, Rand kicking ass...That was awesome. Now to start my listen of ACoS!

Better to read WOT slow or fast? I started reading the eye of the world the other day. Despite my resevations about it due to a prologue which barely made any sense rn im actually starting to really enjoy it. Im listening to the audiobook along with reading. So far i only got to the gleeman chapter.  Is it better to resd slow like i am or to read faster and get more of the plot quicker.  I dont have a preference so asking for others personal experiences

JordanCon: Unanswered Questions panel etc. I noticed a few posts about this, but none of them linked to [the post I made at Theoryland](https://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=9072) so I figured I'd chime in and offer myself for questions. The relevant bits:

1. Kari al'Thor's appearance at the end of TEOTW was indeed just an illusion.
2. Rand did not in fact resurrect Lan during the Last Battle. He just didn't die.

I don't think Maria expected to make any news with these, but I do think this is the first time these things have been said officially.

There has been a lot of debate about Kari al'Thor over the years, but Maria was very firm that it was just an illusion. It came up because someone asked whether Kari al'Thor was a Darkfriend, and Maria seemed surprised that anyone would believe that, so I explained it was because Ishamael appeared to have access to her soul at the end of TEOTW. It was a very convincing illusion because she even thanked Rand for freeing her at the end of it.

I think Brandon [might have intended to leave the Lan thing open-ended,](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1alj0w/sanderson_ama/c8zizue/) for all that's not his style, but Maria said she never even got the impression that he had been resurrected by Rand. Usually it's Team Jordan who errs on the side of open-endedness, and I think Brandon was being open-ended out of respect for them, so it was a bit surprising that Maria weighed in on it. (She might have only done so because she was tired, but ~~haha~~ I mean stuff like this is so scarce these days, I hope she'll forgive me for reporting it.)

For those who don't know (probably most of you, including some who were at the con) I run the World of the Wheel track at JordanCon and I am responsible for all its programming. I moderate this panel myself, along with the one on RJ's notes and the trivia competitions, etc. If you have any questions, feel free to tag me in random conversation like you do Brandon, because Brandon told me this weekend that he has been telling people who ask him about the notes to ask me instead. I basically live on Reddit, so I'm all yours.

Edit: Apparently some people don't know about Team Jordan either. This usually refers to Harriet McDougal, RJ's widow; Maria Simons, RJ's longtime assistant; and Alan Romanczuk, who was Maria's assistant. They all worked together to help Brandon write the last 3 books. Alan is retired now, but he joined the "Team Jordan LIVE" panel this year at JordanCon and we hope to also see him in future years. (Hoping to make that a permanent panel; we'd thought that they had all retired from Team Jordan panels but Jason Denzel of Dragonmount wanted to do one this year, and they agreed, and Maria says they can talk about RJ as often as we like.)

Fantasy: Multiple entities in one body Looking for a darker adult fantasy book where the protagonist has to balance having another sentient entity within their mind.

[LoC] Just Finished Lord of Chaos and Reaction When I finished FoH I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/8balnn/foh_just_finished_fires_of_heaven_and_reaction/) and it did reasonably well so I figured I'd post about Lord of Chaos.

Since there are 13 books and I don't expect people who have read the whole thing to remember the stopping point.  Rand was captured by the White Tower's Aes Sedei and then defeated them with the help of Perrin, Rand's army, wolves, Little Tower's Aes Sedei and men from the Black Tower.  The little Tower's Aes Sedei swore fealty to Rand.  Moghedien escaped with the help of a woman who can channel Saidin.  Elayne is wearing the Amyrlin Seat.

**Reaction**

Why would anyone think that keeping Moghedien on a leash would be a good idea?  Yes, they got some useful information out of her but Nynaeve and Elayne have got to know that there are Darkfriends and Dark Sisters everywhere.  I know people say I'm gonna love Nynaeve eventually but that is just colossally stupid.

I get that Aes Sedei are used to running the show but why do they have to be such jerks to Rand.  Who they admit is the Dragon Reborn and humanities only hope to defeat the Dark One?  Was really happy that Rand forced the Aes Sedei at the end of the book to swear fealty.

Rand school for men who can channel.  This should be fun.  It is like making nukes but your not quite sure if your gonna be able to drop it on the enemy or if it's going to blow up in your face.  But to fight a war against the Dark One you need weapons.  Interested to see how this will play out.

Lan - why did it take him the whole book to reach his destination.  I like Lan and was hoping to see him in the book.

**Reckless Speculation Time**

Lanfear and Morraine - still don't think they are dead.  But now I have some doubts.

Gawn is going to do something stupid and screw up 400 pages of planning because he thinks Rand killed his mom

WhiteCloaks over exaggerates the harm men who can Channel do and get some nations against Rand.

At some point the Whitecloaks are going to find out that Pedron Niall is a Darkfriend. Half the Whitecloaks will remain and the other half will join Galad who will use them as his own personal army who he grudgingly lends to Rand.

**Question**

How do the Black sisters get out of their 3 oaths without going to Shayol Ghul?  I imagine that this RAFO but I'm purplexed.

Stuck on book 7 reread [Spoilers all] I've been slowly working through the series for the second time, occasionally stopping inbetween books to read other books, and I've hit a block. Over the course of FoH and LoC I was getting less and less motivated. Or maybe more and more annoyed. Come to CoS and I just can't get through it. I got partway through chapter 2 and was pretty uninterested, went off to read another book. I came back and powered through a few more chapters, until around chapter 6. Then I left again and read two or three other books. I came back and could barely make it a few pages into chapter 7 before I had to stop again. That was six or seven books ago. I haven't touched CoS in months. I guess I'm feeling frustrated and need to vent

I can't stand the constant bickering between characters. Everyone, even (or sometimes especially) people who are supposed to be really good friends seem to be constantly at each others' throats. Nynaeve/literally everyone else is always a good example of this, but so are Perrin/Faile, Rand/pretty much everyone, Faile/Berelain, the list goes on. You could pair almost any two characters and they wouldn't get along. I know sometimes people just don't like each other but it fees *so* excessive

I can't stand how no one is able to share any information at all with anyone else. Even among allies and close friends hardly anything is shared. Not even personal secrets or anything, but really basic things. Faile *never* tells Perrin why she's upset. Most wetlander nobles will try to withhold basic tactical information from Rand. Rand himself doesn't talk to anyone, but I guess he's sort of another category altogether. No one can talk about their problems at all, ever. No one can be bothered to give their friends a quick "heads up, there's this problem heading your way". Everyone's constantly trying to lever themselves into higher positions by withholding information and conspiring against each other, even when dealing with friends. Information always has to be coerced out of people, and even then it's always given begrudgingly. No one has the *common fucking decency* to explain anything to anyone else. I feel like most of the problems characters face could be solved very easily by just talking to people for once

Ultimately, I feel like asking to have two characters have a normal conversation without any double talk or power plays or keeping pointless, harmful secrets is like asking for a miracle. I know some people can be that standoffish, and some people are that standoffish toward everyone, but Randland feels like a world where *literally everyone* is like that at least some of the time, and most people are like that all of the time, and it's so overwhelmingly oppressive. The only character I can think of who isn't like that is post-epiphany Rand, who is obviously a special case

I know a lot of this is setup for character growth (and WoT does have some *amazing* character growth), but it feels  like this goes way deeper than character growth. This is a problem affecting the whole world, and even among the characters with the most growth Rand is really the only one who truly escapes this problem by the end of the series

Other notes: a few characters/organizations bug me to no end, though mostly due to personal issues with their philosophies rather than a problem with the world/series; in other words this isn't actually a problem but I figured I'd mention it. Namely:Rand, because he's so clearly on a horrible downward spiral and he can't see it/can't see that he's causing most of it himself; Elaida/Sevanna because they're so despicable and blind to their own follies; the Whitecloaks because Lawful Stupid always infuriates me; and most Aes Sedai because they're so prideful and think they know everything when they clearly don't

I realize there are a *lot* of overgeneralizations here, especially since I haven't actually read anything substantial from WoT in months and have been brooding on this instead, but this is how I've been feeling for a while now. I loved the books my first time reading, and I still do love them. These things bothered me the first time but not nearly as much as they have been this time around. I don't really know why I'm getting so much more up in arms now

Has anyone else felt this way? Has anyone else been this bothered? I'm curious to hear what you think

Finished Knife of Dreams, does it get better? Now I'm not dumping on WoT. I *love* these books, they've been genuinely amazing and are easily some of my favorites but these last couple of books have just felt like a slog. It's as if the writer himself just wants to get things over and done with, and yet some things aren't. The main offender being the split in the White Tower, which has been dragging on for so long with no end in sight, while others seem to get resolved with the snap of a finger. Do the last few books improve at all?

Starting WoT Series Hey everyone,

So I just finished some of my favorite series (Stormlight archives, Kingkiller Chronicles, GoT) and the Wheel of Time series has peaked my interest. The same friend who recommended the other amazing series recommended WoT to me. However, after looking through different threads,I've seen a lot of different opinions on the series. Some say it's the best they've ever read, and others that they lost interest halfway through the series. Obviously these are just opinions, but what are your guys' thoughts on it? Do you find some parts of the series uniteresting?

You can pick 3 books from each of the following major genres to introduce a non-reader to reading. Which books do you choose? The genres are:

- Classic Literature

- Fantasy

- Historical Fiction

- Horror

- Literature (Contemporary)

- Non-Fiction

- Science Fiction

- Thriller/Mystery/Suspense

My picks would be:

- Classic Lit: The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, East of Eden by John Steinbeck and Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut

- Fantasy: The Lord of the Rings trilogy by JRR Tolkien, The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and Discworld by Terry Pratchett

- Historical Fiction: The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and Shogun by James Clavell

- Horror: The Shining by Stephen King, The Books of Blood by Clive Barker and House of Leaves by Mark Danielewsky

- Literature (contemporary): Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami, A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini and Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy

- Non-Fiction: A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson, Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan and Endurance by Alfred Lansing

- Sci-fi: Hyperion by Dan Simmons, Dune by Frank Herbert and The Forever War by Joe Haldeman

- Thriller/Mystery: Red Dragon by Thomas Harris, Presumed Innocent by Scott Turow and And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie

Note: These picks should be something geared towards a novice reader as opposed to your favourites or the "best" in their respective genre. E.g. I didn't choose the Malazan series for fantasy even though I think it's "better" than WoT simply because it's a more difficult read, or not picking something like Gravity's Rainbow and Infinite Jest over something like A Thousand Splendid Suns as those are demanding reads as well, even though imo they're superior to ATSS

[Spoilers tFoH] So rereading the series again... I've gone through WoT more than a few times in the past (mostly waiting for the later books), but this is the first time I've done it since AMoL dropped a few years ago - including New Spring and I can't believe I put it off this long to read.

Zipping through EotW, I get to Caemlyn when Rand falls into the Palace gardens during Logain's procession through the city. Brought to Morgase's audience chamber (with an icy reception from Elaida), I'm struck in hindsight by Morgase's line letting him leave.

"I give you your freedom, Rand al'Thor, but I suggest you take a care where you trespass in the future. *If you are found on the Palace grounds again, it will not go so easily with you.*"

Looking back on that, it's unintentionally prescient and hilarious considering the next time Rand's at the Palace is for a throwdown with Rahvin.

[No Spoilers] Poll: What WoT book did you enjoy the most?

2018-05-03 16:08:26
Here's what I read, what else might I enjoy? (mostly Fantasy, some sci-fi) In recent years I've just been rereading the same books over and over again because I know I love them. Well, and whenever my favorite authors released a new book, I got that, but I haven't really added anything new in a while. Here's a bunch of authors / books that I read and how much I liked, or did not like, them. (If you happen to love a book I did not enjoy, please don't be offended, it's just personal preference. :3) I'll list quite a bunch, as I always have an easier time recommending things to other people if I know what else they liked and disliked. I'm not dead-set on fantasy, before someone recommended the Dresden Files to me I was really not into books set in present day.

**Books/authors wot I love:**
* Jim Butcher (Dresden Files, Aeronaut's Windlass, Codex Alera)
* Brandon Sanderson (2nd Mistborn Trilogy, Elantris, Warbreaker, The Emperor's Soul)
* Old Man's War (John Scalzi)

**Books/authors wot I like:**
* Brandon Sanderson (everything else he wrote)
* The Black Company
* Patrick Rothfuss
* Ilona Andrews (Magic &lt;verbs&gt;)
* X-Wing Series (A. Allston, M.A. Stackpole)

**Books/authors wot I think are okay:**
* Joe Abercrombie (First Law, etc)
* R. Zelazny (The Great Book of Amber)
* Robin Hobb
* A Song of Ice and Fire
* Brent Weeks (Nightangel Trilogy)

**Books/authors wot I did not like or no longer like:**
* Tolkien
* Wheel of Time
* R.A. Salvatore
* D. Eddings
* R. Feist
* Piers Anthony (On a pale horse, etc)

[OB]Well Brightlords and Ladys Ive started Oathbringer and wow its been such a great ride so far. Here is how it happed. no spoilers on OB please. I finished the wot books and sought something new something I haven't had spoiled into storming oblivion. I read up on Sandersons works because I liked how he finished the wot books, I bought Elantris and enjoyed it. I had a hard time deciding between the mistborn books or the SA books but eventually decided to go for SA.

Now I was about to dive right in but was advised that I should read warbreaker first. I did and it was pretty good as well.

Once finished with that I finally got to read tWoK and loved it. Burned right through WoR ( Spoilers for tWoK and WoR are definitely going to be thrown around soon ) I like how the black sword in now szeths. I knew wit was a world hopper but haveing him talk about perfect pitch sealed the deal, I can't wait to read more of him.

Kaladin was so boss at the end of both books so far his use of the honor blade gave me chills. Shallans back story broke my storming heart, I had a hunch she killed her mom but the way her dad took the blame and eventually killed by her was just so sad.

Dalinar actually bonding the storm father himself was just wow. I knew he would need a damn good spren but I didn't think about anyone doing that. That was great.

Edgedancer was a fun little read I finished this morning. What was that guy in the ally? I just kept thinking it was some sort of Lovecraftien being I can't comprehend lol but still a great little novella.

Now on Oathbringer and already it's just so enjoyable the artwork on the inside of the dust jacket and the inner cover is amazing. I'm only on the second chapter but it's great be part of the Fandom and getting to experience this beautiful series.

Rereading immediately Did my first readthrough of WoT recently but when I finished it, instead of moving on I just had to immediately start over from the beginning. It wasn't even my favorite series ever or anything (though I loved the last 4 books) but just because of how much of it was confusing to me the first time, I wanted to reread it while it was still fresh in my mind. Or at least start rereading it anyway. So I reread the first four books. It really was much more interesting the second time through, when you understand all the little things that are being referenced. However I'm a few chapters into book 5 and I think I'm finally ready to move on, after what must have been at least a year of reading nothing but WoT. I've put off reading the new Stormlight Archive book long enough. Anybody else read the whole series and then start again immediately, and if so how far did you get?

Started the series over after reading up to Book 2 last year. Some thoughts and questions I am very excited to get back into this series. I came in after finishing WoT and some other random books last year and did some digging into the lore to help give me a base going into GotM and I loved it. I also thought DG was good, but I was hit by fatigue and did not progress. Something about the world started pulling me back about 6 months later. I read so many reviews about it that make it seem like it was tailor made for me, and I think it is. It can just be confusing because I don't completely understand the world yet. The contents below are a composite of 18 months of pondering so read at your own peril.

I love the idea of ascendants and gods that can only die by being killed by mortals (which I'm sure will be both epic and heartbreaking). I love that they shuffle into the Deck of Dragons and certain mages can predict future convergences by reading it. We've only seen like 10% max of the characters in the deck, so I look forward to seeing more ascendants in these High Houses. I love the people and cultures in Seven Cities, but my god the brutality of this world.

I completely do not understand warrens, and I think that's by design and also pretty cool. They are alternate realms that can link to this one, and mages can tap into them for power. Or something. But I hear their connection to this world is one of the best revelations in the series, and I have a feeling it'll blow my mind.

On that note, the magic is really cool. It feels so much more terrifying than in other series. Even the Wheel of Time, where power was used to nearly destroy the world, the way sorcery is described in this series is just violent.

The intrigue behind this world is incredible. When Raest woke up and the first thing he did was feel for the sleeping goddess Burn and wound her, my brain lit up. I feel like that is very important, and wonder what happens if she wakes up... or dies. I'll probably find out somewhere in the old book.

This compounds with Tool's dialogue to Lorn about futility, and why the Imass don't care to think. If immortal beings that, as I seem to understand, have always been alive don't care about anything, that seems like a very bad thing for everybody on this world. What about this realm drives the race of people that have always inhabited it into futility?

The same sort of mindset can be seen in the Tiste Andii as explained by Anomander Rake to Baruk. He's been alive 300,000 years and goes about fighting for causes (currently, resist the empire) while none of his people care anymore simply because he knows no other way of living. It seems like this ancient world is filled with ancient peoples just going with the flow of brutal conflict.

I also like how Erickson handled the deaths at the end of these two books. Lorn and Duiker, who were both good people at their hearts who served the Empire well and died unceremoniously for their loyalty. Getting into the mind of Lorn as she begins to question the Empire and seeing Duiker the old historian doing everything he can to help and survive and seeing them both die the way they do... and the Chain of Dogs, culling of the nobility (with the chains of your shackles? WTF, Steve?), Felisin's entire viewpoint in DG... this shit hits deep. Thus far it is a very sad story, and I don't see it getting too cheery before it gets worse.

My favorite scene thus far is Quick Ben whipping up a quick ritual that felt like he was winging it and popping into the Shadow Realm. Outsmarting Shadowthrone and being recognized (as a shapeshifter, as well) before he gets pulled back out was really cool. I think I like it so much because it is the first time we see a man step up to a god and come out on top. But Quick is also just a badass. Seven Warrens, I'm guessing, is borderline impossible to master, but I'm pretty sure Quick has that trait. And he has a warren that puts him at Kalam, his master assassin pal's side. These two are awesome.

The world reminds me a lot of the Elder Scrolls, like Morrowind but with three times the complexity. You have gods that love to fuck with mortals, and they even gift magical items to people they track. Dark Elves and high elves, the Empire and its resistance, powerful leaders achieving godhood, etc. Or like the Ancient Roman Empire if you condensed the times of Caesar with the fall of Rome and threw the Roman Gods into the conflicts. I love it.

I have too many questions, so I'll just throw a few that keep bugging me since I refuse to risk myself to spoilers for this one. If my questions are satisfied if I read and find out, please let me know. I don't want any juicy spoilers, just clarity:

- The Jaghut people. They basically look like Orcs, but the power they can draw from their warren is immense? Am I following that? Raest did a crazy amount of damage and stood up to five dragons. There used to be a whole community of these people, but how many where there? They seem too powerful to have a society. Icarium is half-Jag, and has that same tremendous and terrible power, correct? Also, his companion is a Trell. What is a trell? I feel like I missed that description.

- Hairlock. What the hell is going on here? He was a casualty at the Siege of Pale when the imperial High Mage turned on his own and tried to annihilate the last mages of Whiskeyjack's old army. Hairlock gets split in half, and Quick Ben puts his soul in a puppet? Then the puppet goes crazy and starts killing people, Tiste Andii and hounds of shadow? Any help understanding what's going on with Hairlock in the first book?

- Tattersail, too. What happened to her? She was 'killed' by sorcery but her soul was transferred to a baby that is growing up really fast. I feel like I missed a bit. The conversation between Paran and the people on the plain that apparently knew what became of her didn't really help me understand what was going on.

- K'rul and Kruppe. How does K'rul appear to Kruppe? In dreams? They also appear before Raest and attempt to diffuse him, but fail. I don't understand how they are doing this, and it feels like Kruppe is bending time or something. Any insight or is this a RAFO scenario?

- The Tiste Edur are grey-skinned elves, and apparently were only mentioned once in an ancient book, but we find their destroyed realm in DG. The boat part, where the Imass bonecaster appears and talks with them for a bit before vanishing. First off, the Imass are really interesting, pretty confusing, and and the whole idea about them is terrifying. Second, what the hell is going on in this scene at the boat? How did the two parties meet here, of all places, and run into Imass of all people, and what the hell is going on at this point with these arcs? I felt so confused in these chapters the first time I read it and still find myself confused as I read them now. Also, they say the Tiste Edur are only mentioned once and never seen but doesn't Kalam run into one later in this book?

- Is the wiki safe to browse at all? I've read some chapter summaries and it seems pretty good, but the first time I clicked a link to see a map, I saw a word. Was. Maybe this whole story is ancient history and everything in is is referred to in past-tense (like if you read about Ancient Rome/Greece/etc on wikipedia), but I'll always be a little worried that I spoiled myself that the ending is an end-of-the-world loss for the good guys.

- Are there any good resources to digest that are spoiler free? I feel like to truly enjoy a story I need to immerse myself in it, and the only thing keeping me from completely enjoying this story is that I don't understand the world. That will come with time as I read more, but the more spoiler-free content I can read about the world, the better.

- Is this sub safe to browse if you're avoiding spoilers, or should I avoid until I finish the main series?

I finally have time to read!!!! I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I wanted to share it somewhere. I just started summer break, and now I finally have time to read! I celebrated by ordering about $150 of books. They are mostly works by Sanderson because I want to catch up with everything in the Cosmere, but I also ordered a copy of Gardens of the Moon and Kings of the Wyld because I saw people discussing them on here. I'm super excited to add to my collection. I'm not sure what I want to read first. I'm rereading WoT currently, but it won't take me too long to finish now that I actually have time to read. After that I get to begin brand new adventures.

Sorry if I rambled on about nothing, but I wanted to share my enthusiasm somewhere I thought it would be appreciated.

Struggling with the Mary Sue-ness of Egwene (spoilers) So, just started TGS, on my first re-read since I became familiar with the term ‘Mary Sue’. And this subreddit is my first experience with an online WoT community so it took me a little while to learn how widely (and vehemently) Egwene is disliked as a character.

But just... wow. Leaving aside her character in terms of emotions and actions, the Mary Sue is really laid on with a trowel.

On my original read I neither really liked her not disliked her, but reading this as someone older and more widely-read, it’s kinda hard to read scenes where a woman over 200 years old is asking Egwene to tell her what to do, or in a tower full of Gray Ajah, whose literal life calling is to politics, mediation, harmony, and consensus, it’s only Egwene who can see how bad the split in the Ajahs is, or where she’s easily mastering skills from other cultures she’s never had any formal training in.

I totally get that I’m not the first person to comment on this, but yikes. It’s like reading Wesley Crusher in a dress.

Should I read WoT? I recently finished Brandon Sanderson's Oathbringer and I'm craving more well built fantasy world and epicness and while I was about to just jump head first into the WoT series I bumped into reviews/opinions about how slow it can be, pointless side stories and terrible PoV.

I think it can be easier to find criticism than praise for some things like this though - so should I read WoT or look elsewhere?

I convinced someone who has not read a book sense high school (ten years) to read wheel of time. I needed to talk to someone about it so I just started talking to my former roommate about the books. Not caring he had no idea what I was talking about, I just had to bounce my thoughts off of someone.

Shortly after he moved out of my house he messaged me saying he's halfway through tEotW on audio book and he loves it.

A few months later he's on book 8 still loving the books.

I'm just happy I was able to get someone to experience the greatness that is wot.

Question about WoT, books vs Audio (please no spoilers) Hey All,

i recently decided i was ready to take a stab at WoT. The thing is, I often like to go back and forth between real book and audiobook, cause I can listen while I do things like commute, cardio, etc.

Usually books line up pretty evenly, or there is one prologue, so I know if my audiobook is chapter 24, the real book is on chapter 23.

I noticed the second chapter of WoT started with some time left in chapter one in the audio version. Is this going to be an issue with it not evenly spread out throughout each book? really appreciate any help please.

Considering reading the Redwall series as an adult. Hi all,

I've been considering for a while reading the Redwall series (Brian Jacques). I'm a big Discworld, WoT, general high fantasy fan, and definitely remember reading at least 2 or 3 of the series as a child (although which ones and in which order I couldn't tell you)

Just wanted some opinions of any fans (or critics) of the series? Is it worth re-reading as an adult? Will the themes be too childish, obviously aside from the fact they are all animals! I was a little worried in the same way when I reread discworld recently but It surprised me how much I enjoyed them from a new perspective

Anyway, thanks! Look forward to reading any responses

Anyone have Audible vs Print book guide for first 3 books? (no spoilers please) Hey all,

I posted something similar on r/fantasy asking about WoT chapters in the print book vs on Audible.

To date, every book I have read has lined up perfectly (with the exception of a prologue chapter being chapter 1 and chapter 1 being chapter 2) but even so, that is pretty easy to figure out. I like to go back and forth because I listen while I commute, and do cardio, errands etc; but still like to read for an hour or two at night when I can.

Based off my post there, it seems like the first 3 books of WoT do not line up , so for example, chapter 2 starts with 8 minutes left in chapter one.

Does anyone have a guide for the first 3 books so I know what chapters start when in the Audio Version? Really appreciate anyone's help, and really looking forward to getting into this series regardless!!

Ignore this - just a test - will be deleted soon Has Anyone Read ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’?

Apparently there’s a joke book called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’, and I was wondering if anyone here had heard of it, because I seriously want to get my hands on a copy.

I’ve been into dark humour for as long as I can remember. No topic is off-limits. Terrorism. The Holocaust. Dead babies. Whatever. I don’t care about things being offensive; as long as it’s a good joke, I’m up for it.

So when I heard about ‘1000 Dark Jokes’, I knew I wanted to read it. The problem is, it doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. I’ve searched for hours online, I’ve looked on Amazon and Waterstones, I’ve scoured the local bookshops and libraries (Side note – I discovered that libraries are still a thing!). I even contacted some of the biggest libraries in the country and asked them to search through their stock. Nothing. There wasn’t a scrap of evidence that this book had ever been written.

Except for one forum.

It’s one I’ve been lurking in for a long time, but never got around to posting in. A celebration of grim jokes and gross-out humour. It’s where I’ve read some of the best material I’ve ever come across. And some of the most downright awful.

It’s called RapeAndPunnage.org

As I was browsing through it a few weeks ago, I stumbled across this old thread, which is the only mention of ‘1000 Dark Jokes’ that I’ve been able to find anywhere. I thought of trying to summarise it for you lot, but I may as well just copy/paste the whole thread – it’s not that long – and hopefully someone here will be able to give me some pointers. Who knows, you might even recognise a username or two!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I found a book today in the second hand shop at the bottom of my street. It caught my eye because of the title, and straight away I thought of you lot. It’s a jokebook, with a blank front cover, and the title in embossed, silvery-black print down the spine. It’s called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’.

&gt;I’ve read a few now. They don’t seem to be what I’d call ‘jokes’. More like… statements. Or like –

&gt;Okay, I’ll type a few out and show you what I mean.

&gt;*#0001 – A man walks up to his doctor. “Help me,” he screams, “my lungs are burning!”. He collapses to the floor, and begins to cough blood onto the doctor’s new shoes. The doctors spits on him and laughs.*

&gt;That’s it. That’s the first joke in the book. I read it about a dozen times trying to see what I’d missed, whether there was a pun I wasn’t getting or something. But that really does seem to be it. And they’re all like that.

&gt;*#0012 – An old lady sits on a quiet beach. In the distance, she sees a flock of birds gliding past. She weeps, for she knows she will die alone.*

&gt;And #0017 is just *A baby dies in agony*.

&gt;I have to admit, I did actually laugh at some of these. Not because they’re funny, but just from the sheer audacity of someone publishing this as a jokebook. But I’ve found I really enjoy reading through it, a couple dozen jokes at a time, while I’m on the bus or whatever. Do any of you guys own ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? Is there something I’m missing?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;LOL! Nvr heard of it but it sounds lik an absolute MINDFUCK! Got to get me a copy!! XD

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Its bettr thn any jokes uv evr cum up wth u pussy f@g!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;JITO, you’ve been warned before. Contribute to the discussion or not at all.

&gt;FG1988, I was really interested to see this get posted up. My sister had a copy of this, and we used to read it together after mom and dad had gone to bed. We were way too young, looking back. It’s probably what started me liking all of this sick shit come to think of it! Anyway, I’ll see if I can dig it out from somewhere. Out of interest, have you carried on reading it? Got any favourites?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Haha, can’t imagine a little kid reading this stuff! Some of it is proper intense! Do you remember the one about the cat, I think it was thirty-something. Just a really detailed description of it being murdered.

&gt;My favourites are probably the ones that are less gruesome and more bizarre – they sort of leave you stunned for a moment wondering how anyone thought to print it!

&gt;Like *#0143 – A rich man and a poor man are standing on top of a mountain. The poor man says to the rich man, “We only have enough food to get one of us down the mountain”. The rich man says, “Yes, you should take it and go.” The poor man cries with gratitude, and promises to make a shrine to the rich man upon his arrival home. When the poor man is part way down the mountain, he is set upon by savage wolves, and killed. The rich man is among them. He feasts.*

&gt;I’ve just got this really funny mental image of the Monopoly Man covered in wolfskin, calmly cutting into a human arm with a knife and fork!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Huh. I partly remember that one. I thought it ended with something like “the rich man watched from a distance until he starved to death.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;I like number 399. ‘A nun is raped. She screams and screams, but it does not stop. She bleeds onto her robes, and dies. Her god is a lie.’

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Fucking PWNED lol!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;“Her god is a lie.”

&gt;Hey, I take offence to that! ;P

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I’ve got it! Our old copy of 1TDJ. It’s dusty, and it’s definitely seen better days, but it’s just about held it together. I’ve found the joke I was remembering from earlier.

&gt;Number 679: *A dog loved its owner very much. One day, she lay down some food before it. The dog wanted the food very much, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down more food. The dog was very hungry, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down even more food. The dog was in terrible pain, but the owner did not let it eat. The dog watched the food. The dog smelled the food. The dog sat by the food until it starved to death. The dog loved its owner very much.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;poor doggo :( i du lik dese jokes tho so i got tha book tuk me ages 2 find it but its grate so funny!

&gt;i lik the 1s with no animals tho

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I think it gets funnier the more you read. You get past a barrier, remind yourself that no one is actually being hurt, and that sort of lets you laugh at it. Does that make sense?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;You’ve got that backwards. Your “barrier” is stopping you from actually enjoying yourself. The real fun comes after you don’t need the book any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;What do you mean?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;rofl @ no. 582!! a child is asked 2 go 2 bed. they ask 4 mor time up. their parents rip ther skin away!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;That’s really weird. I’ve just read #0852. It’s like a twisted mirror of that joke. *A child stands at the foot of their parents’ bed. The child bleeds. Their skin has been torn away. The parents weep. “Please don’t come to bed,” they cry. The child only smiles. They will always come to bed.*

&gt;Is there come kind of narrative to this book?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;What if WE ARE THE NARRATIVE?! MIND = BLOWN!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Not a great medium for a narrative. Most people don’t read the jokes in order. Unless I guess it’s going for a whole “every experience is unique” deal. I don’t really get that vibe from it. I think you’re meant to just dip in and out of it when you want to. It’s more addictive that way, y’know?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;well im lovin it sooooo funny lol! gets bettr the mor u read

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I definitely agree with that. Although, I read the very last joke today. Have any of you guys looked at that one? Not what I expected. It’s a bit… weird.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;lol 2 dark 4 u? get off the forum u f@g

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Nah, like I said above, I don’t read joke books cover to cover. I think I flicked past it once, but it seemed pretty long, and it looked like it repeated itself a lot. Was it good weird or bad weird?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I’m not sure. I’ve read through it a few times now. It’s just a really odd one. I’ll try to copy it out (I’ll skip the middle bit, you’ll see why), but I guess you just have to read your own copy to get the full effect.

&gt;*#1000 – Once upon a time, there was a book of jokes. People read the book. They read jokes about death and rape and suffering, and they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed*

&gt;[It goes on like this for a few pages. I’ll skip to the final bit].

&gt;*The people laughed for a long, long time. They laughed until it hurt. Then they stopped laughing. The jokes in the book weren’t enough. They needed more than the book. They needed new jokes. They needed real jokes. They made their own jokes. And then they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed.*

&gt;I guess it’s a bit funny? In a sort of anti-humour kind of way?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I guess so

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;OK this is sick, srsly, someone get the admins in on this.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;What’s wrong? I just want you to laugh. And laugh and laugh and laugh.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[Thread locked]

&amp;nbsp;

And that’s it. That’s the full thread. As far as I can tell, it’s the only one on the site, or anywhere else for that matter, that mentions ‘1000 Dark Jokes’. No, I don’t know what the deleted posts were, they were removed long before I got there. I can imagine, but I’d rather believe they weren’t what I think they probably were. In any case, of the users above, FG and StabbyPete don’t seem to have posted anywhere else after this. I’m pretty sure they were both banned. So was JewsInTheOven, but he kept posting after this. Nothing about the book, just troll drivel. DontTellMom stuck around for a long time, last active a few months ago, but didn’t reply to any private messages I sent. Neither did any of the others. It’s an old thread, they probably don’t use the forum anymore.

In any case, this is literally everything I know about ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make your Soul Rot’. Please, *please* tell me one of you knows about this book. I *need* to read it!

Edit: So since posting this, the original thread has been deleted. Not sure if that’s a coincidence, but seems pretty odd timing.

Edit2: You’re not going to believe this! The book is real! Someone sent me a copy! Don’t know who, but *thank you!!!* Been reading through a few of them, it’s exactly as described above. Weird, but it’s great knowing it really exists! Must have already read through a hundred or so, it really does get funnier the further in you get! Once I’m finished I’ll share my favourites!

Edit3: Nearly done, now!

Edit4: They weren’t kidding about that last joke. It goes on over seven pages. Very funny though. Maybe the best one.

Edit5: It repeats “and laughed” exactly one thousand times. I counted.

Edit6: Does anyone want to see a video of my baby sister?

Some thoughts on how viewpoints from the books might affect the TV Show (Spoilers All) *All data pulled from (https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/statistical-analysis-wheel-time/)*

Based on the pretty charts found in the article (which pulled its numbers from WOT Wikia) it seems that if the show follows the POVs from the books in any meaningful way that we will more than likely have more female led scenes than any others. This is assuming that they make it past the first couple of books where it's pretty much Rand-Matrim-Perrin.

Assuming the show is written in similar POV style we will also see A LOT from Aes Sedai and everyone's favorite Taveren(s). I'm really hoping that we get the frequent viewpoints shifts to the Chosen...erm... Forsaken. For me they have always been some of the most interesting characters, specifically how you realize over the course of the series that while they *are* ridiculously powerful relative to Rand's Age, they really aren't all that remarkable. Definitely not superhuman. That's really a testament to Robert Jordan's commitment to the idea that ideas and stories change with time and distance. The more time the readers spent with the Forsaken the more we realized that they were really just kind of lucky evil people.

A Couple Questions Returning (Spoilers up to WH) Hello /r/WoT,

I recently returned to the series after a long hiatus and just finished a Path of Daggers and started Winter's Heart this weekend. Two Questions:

Where is Mat? I feel like I haven't heard from him in at least 700 pages of these books and I can't remember what he was up to the last time I heard him. He was around with the Bowl of Winds, but what did he do when they resolved that issue.

Same thing with Padan Fain? Where has he been and what was he doing the last time we encountered him.

Any help is good help. Thanks

Looking for a particular kind of series I've recently finished the Wheel of Time and the first three books of Sanderson's Stormlight Archive and I'm trying to find something similar, but so far nothing has quite matched what I want. Does anyone have any recommendations for epic fantasy that spans for longer than a trilogy but also keeps the story with the same core group of characters? Setting (Magic, magical creatures, etc) doesn't matter so much as the quality of the characters and how much the story sticks with them. I've seen Malazan Book of the Fallen recommended as being similar to WoT and SA, but it also seems like characters aren't very permanent (I might be wrong about this). I've also read the Mistborn trilogy.

What aspects of the series carry over to you day to day life? My brother (14) is on book 7 on his first read of WoT, and we reference the books constantly.

Whenever one of us messes up or drops the ball on akmethont we'll say "You have toh", "I have toh", or " you lack ji".

Also, whenever we ask each other to do something and we dont want to/ cant do said thing, we'll ask "Would you be Nae'blis?"

Anybody else here have something like this that you do?

What do you think will be cut or severally compressed for the TV series? *Spoilers* Just started my second read through of the series, my mind keeps jumping to this thought. What scenes will be missing or altered from the TV series for the sake of time? If you've read GoT and watched the series, you'll know what I mean (or Harry Potter or any numerous other book-film adaptions.)  I'm not a master of WoT lore so it would be interesting to hear what others think.

Something like removing Elyas' whole story line. Possibly just have Perrin naturally develop his talents as they travel. Then learn the rest of what he needs to know from Hopper. Perrin and Egwene would run into the Freefolk without his help. The freefolk would welcome the two to their camp anyway. And I imagine the stay with the Freefolk would only last a night.

It would suck because I think Elyas is really cool. But I could see this happening.

Is the Wheel of Time really worth reading??? I have been back and forth on whether to read WoT or not, there just seems to be so many dissenting opinions about the series's. So my question is: in the context of the current fantasy meta, with works like ASOIAF and Stormlight, does WoT warrant itself a series worth reading, with such a huge time investment? I feel like so many of its supporters are blinded by nostalgia because of how they essentially grew up with the series or something like that , so i find it hard to trust their opinion.

Some people will say to read it because its a classic, my answer is that i don't care whether its a classic, i only want to read books if they're good.

Others often say to read it because "its popular for a reason" \- that's a population fallacy.

And to people who say to just read the first book and see for myself, i'm asking about the series as a whole not just the first book.

So can anybody with a reasonably neutral bias of the series advise whether or not the Wheel Of Time  holds up even today?

Reading for travelling Going travelling for 1-2 months over the summer and I find this the best time to do some reading, especially on the beach or plane! SO I wanted to ask you guys for some fantasy series you would recommend me! I'd preferably like some larger fantasy series with many books. Also as I'm travelling it might be nice to have some fantasy where a lot of travel is involved!

Here are some of the larger series I've read. I may have missed some so apologies if you mention one I forgot to mention.

WoT
Malazan
Everything Joe Abercrombie, Robin Hobb, David Eddings, Raymond E Feist, David Gemmell and Brandon Sanderson related.

To give you an idea of what I like my favourites include: Joe Abercrombie, Luke Scull, Anthony Ryan, David Gemmell, John Gwynne.

Have currently got The Black Company ready but would definitely like some more! Thanks!

Re-Listen after Stopping in 2003 [Spoilers Pre-Winter's Heart] Been doing lots of reading on this sub and finally wanted to share about my WoT experiences.

I started reading WoT in '98 when my grandmother got my the first 4 books \(hardcover\) for Christmas. I was in middle school at the time and I remember reading and enjoying through Winter's Heart. After that I started college and things just got away from me. When the news of a tv series came out \(for reals this time guys!\) I've started the series over, this time listening on Audible at 1.5x speed. I have a 30 minute drive to and from work so I get a good chunk of listening in each day. I'm currently about a quarter of the way through Lord of Chaos.

Thinking back in my initial reading experience I really feel like quite a bit went over my head as a younger reader. I remember liking Matt \(he was funny\) and sometimes even skimming any chapter not from the main 3 perspective. Listening now as an adult there is *so much* more book. I dunno. I also find, now being married, that I connect quite a bit with Perrin. Also, I'm looking forward to getting to Crossroads...100&amp;#37; new stuff...then again, rereading this now it almost seems like I've never read it before...

What do you guys think is a good age to start WoT? I \(obviously\) think I started a bit young, YMMV.

On re\-reads do you find that you connect with other characters less/more?

How likely are is it that the tv series is trash? I hope not.

Brandon Sanderson books to read after Wheel of Time I am currently on Winter's Heart and really enjoying the series right now. I was thinking about what I would do when I finally finish the series and though about exploring more Brandon Sanderson since the last 3 books were written by him. I heard many good things about the Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series. Which would you recommend and why? Also, are there any other books by this author or any other author you would recommend as a follow\-up to WoT?

The next big fantasy. Would like to know everyone's thoughts here. What does everyone tip to be the next big fantasy series? It can be any media; books, TV etc.

With the likes of LOTR and WoT in the works for TV, Raymond E Feist starting the Firemane Sage, The Dark Tower in development, it's a good (hopefully not overwhelming) time to be a fantasy fan. It can be anything that is standalone or a series but just looking to discuss the future of fantasy. Let's hear your thoughts!

Wheel of Time Mount and Blade Warband First of all, huge WoT fan, but my first post on this subreddit for some time \(longtime lurker\). I've read the series five times \(probably a few less for the last couple books, as they were published after my initial readthroughs\). This introduced me the world of fantasy when I read Eye of the World in seventh grade, and I haven't looked back and am now 15 years older. This and Malazan are my top two series, for different reasons.

Anyways, I figured I should post this image \(not sure how good the quality is\) but I have recently gotten into the Wheel of Time mod for Mount and Blade Warband and am loving it. I am the Red, my kingdom is called Dragon Rising, and my character's name is Guire Amalasan \(yes I know I am missing an A in the first name, I was a few Johnny Walker's deep when I created the character\). My character is a boss channeler that knows more than a dozen weaves including a certain B\-word. Yes, it is that detailed that you can pick the weaves you channel \(apart from also having the option to go melee or shoot a bow, etc\)

I have just defeated the Dragonspawn and taken Shayol Gul along with multiple other kingdoms and am about to go head to head with Rand! It's my own alternative version of history. I think my favorite is that Guaire's army \(most of which is garrisoned in the town's I have already conquered\) includes some Red Ajah :\)...; I also have some of the Forsaken as my vassals... since this is a no spoilers post I will not include their names, but let's just say one of them came out Deus Ex Machina in the final book and another is an arachnid. Another's grave is no bar to his cell.

For those of you who do not know Mount and Blade \(or how to get the mods\) I highly suggest it. It's a great way to connect to the world after you have finished the books. The geography and the nobles and their armies and the factions are remarkably accurate. \*There are also fantastic mods for A Song of Ice and Fire, and Lord of the Rings, along with many others \-\- very addicting.

This is my first post on this subreddit, and I could not figure out how to get my flair to work \(Reddit noob\), but Duty is Heavier than a Mountain, Death Lighter than a Feather.

Here's to hoping the series is adapted correctly when it goes to TV. I am not sure it is possible to do it right and do it justice, but then again, *Dovie'andi se tovya sagain.* As long as Rufus Sewell is Ishamael I will be happy.

Many ideas contained in this post thanks to the dozen mojitos I just imbibed but thanks for reading. I was careful not to include any spoilers... Cheers.

[CoT spoilers] Crossroads of Twilight.....Couldn't do it. So after being about 7 chapters in where nothing interesting happened and I  kept seeing names I can barely remember, I came to the conclusion that it's WoT encyclopedia summary time.   After finishing the summaries only opening the book where there was Mat/Tuon dialogue,  I'm quite sure I made the right decision....

That being said  KoD has started out with a bang. Now I'm really hoping the stagnant Perrin chapters can pick up. The plot with Elyas and Morgase has so much potential that just hasn't developed into real page burners.

Books 1-4 seemed like a sprint, where as 5 and 6 slowed to a jog, and now it seems like he's just walking. I really hope these books are saving up for a good sprint to the finish.

Trying not to piss the hardcore fans of the series off, but what started as fast paced and great series has really  turned into a slow tedious read.  Although I understand Jordan was having his health issues which would set anyone back.

Please give me reasons and encouragement to finish the first book. I have never wanted to finish a series so bad as The Wheel of Time, but I am slogging my through The Eye of the World. I'm 500 pages in, but I took a two-month break because I just got so bored. Chapters about characters getting from Point A to Point B bores me to no end. What more about a whole book? (I know, I know, journeys are a big part of fantasy books. Sorry.)

Now, I keep hearing great things about WoT, and I know that it will be all worth in the end, but when I attempted to get back into reading the first book, I read two pages before going on a break. Again. And I'm so frustrated because this series in my book bucket list. Like I've said, I have never wanted to finish a series so bad.

So please, please, please, just encourage me. I want to finish it, even if just EOTW for now. Thank you!

Good book recaps? Hi all,

I LOVE WoT but I've never been able to finish the series (for whatever reason something always seems to come up and I end up reading something quicker). That being said it's been probably 7 years since I've touched the series and I definitely need a refresher. I don't want to start all over - I'm either halfway through Crossroads of Twilight or I just finished it (Rand just cleansed the source), so I'm almost there! So I guess my question is - does anyone have any recommendations of any thorough recaps of the books? I still remember the characters (for the most part) but I know for sure I've definitely forgotten a lot. Any help would be great!

Any news on the WoT tv series? When it was first announced about a year ago, I was super excited. They announced while I was in the middle of reading the series for the first time. I would try to find new information about every week or so, but nothing new ever came out. I just looked again today, and didn’t see anything. Does anybody know anything about the series or have a good place to find information, or have they just not announced anything?

[No Spoilers] I have a tough time reading WoT and need advice  Hey WoT fans, so it's always been a struggle for me to read novels, sentences often go over my head (descriptions and action scenes mostly) and I find myself reading the same paragraph again and again to fully comprehend what i'm supposed to be visualizing, and I hate it because I lose so much time and it really breaks the pace and the atmosphere.

 I really want to get absorbed into the WoT world, and I LOVE Robert Jordan's prose from what I read, but the description scenes, which arrive often from what I understand are really hard for me to read, not because they aren't great, but because I read the description scenes so many times since I starting the book that it kinda breaks the atmosphere. So..Any tips thanks toward not caring about it too much, or towards reading better thanks :)

1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot Apparently there’s a joke book called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’, and I was wondering if anyone here had heard of it, because I seriously want to get my hands on a copy.

I’ve been into dark humour for as long as I can remember. No topic is off-limits. Terrorism. Slavery. Dead babies. Whatever. I don’t care about things being offensive; as long as it’s a good joke, I’m up for it.

So when I heard about ‘1000 Dark Jokes’, I knew I wanted to read it. The problem is, it doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. I’ve searched for hours online, I’ve looked on Amazon and Waterstones, I’ve scoured the local bookshops and libraries (Side note – I discovered that libraries are still a thing!). I even contacted some of the biggest libraries in the country and asked them to search through their stock. Nothing. There wasn’t a scrap of evidence that this book had ever been written.

Except for one forum.

It’s one I’ve been lurking in for a long time, but never got around to posting in. A celebration of grim jokes and gross-out humour. It’s where I’ve read some of the best material I’ve ever come across. And some of the most downright awful.

It’s called RapeAndPunnage.org

As I was browsing through it a few weeks ago, I stumbled across this old thread, which is the only mention of ‘1000 Dark Jokes’ that I’ve been able to find anywhere. I thought of trying to summarise it for you lot, but I may as well just copy/paste the whole thread – it’s not that long – and hopefully someone here will be able to give me some pointers. Who knows, you might even recognise a username or two!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I found a book today in the second hand shop at the bottom of my street. It caught my eye because of the title, and straight away I thought of you lot. It’s a jokebook, with a blank front cover, and a title in embossed, silvery-black print down the spine. It’s called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’.

&gt;I’ve read a few now. They don’t seem to be what I’d call ‘jokes’. More like… statements. Or like –

&gt;Okay, I’ll type a few out and show you what I mean.

&gt;*#0001 – A man walks up to his doctor. “Help me,” he screams, “my lungs are burning!”. He collapses to the floor, and begins to cough blood onto the doctor’s new shoes. The doctors spits on him and laughs.*

&gt;That’s it. That’s the first joke in the book. I read it about a dozen times trying to see what I’d missed, whether there was a pun I wasn’t getting or something. But that really does seem to be it. And they’re all like that.

&gt;*#0012 – An old lady sits on a quiet beach. In the distance, she sees a flock of birds gliding past. She weeps, for she knows she will die alone.*

&gt;What kind of punchline is that? The jokes don’t seem to really set up anything, beyond describing horrible things happening to random people.

&gt;#0017 is just *A baby dies in agony*.

&gt;I have to admit, I did actually laugh at some of these. Not because they’re funny, but just from the sheer audacity of someone publishing this as a jokebook. But I’ve found I really enjoy reading through it, a couple dozen jokes at a time, while I’m on the bus or whatever. Do any of you guys own ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? Is there something I’m missing?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;LOL! Nvr heard of it but it sounds lik an absolute MINDFUCK! Got to get me a copy!! XD

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Its bettr thn any jokes uv evr cum up wth u pussy f@g!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;JITO, you’ve been warned before. Contribute to the discussion or not at all.

&gt;FG1988, I was really interested to see this get posted up. My sister had a copy of this, and we used to read it together after mom and dad had gone to bed. We were way too young, looking back. It’s probably what started me liking all of this sick shit come to think of it! Anyway, I’ll see if I can dig it out from somewhere. Out of interest, have you carried on reading it? Got any favorites?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Haha, can’t imagine a little kid reading this stuff! Some of it is proper intense! Do you remember the one about the cat, I think it was number thirty-something. Just a really detailed description of it being murdered.

&gt;My favourites are probably the ones that are less gruesome and more bizarre – they sort of leave you stunned for a moment wondering how anyone thought to print it!

&gt;Like *#0143 – A rich man and a poor man are standing on top of a mountain. The poor man says to the rich man, “We only have enough food to get one of us down the mountain”. The rich man says, “You should take it and go.” The poor man cries with gratitude, and promises to make a shrine to the rich man upon his arrival home. When the poor man is part way down the mountain, he is set upon by savage wolves, and killed. The rich man is among them. He feasts.*

&gt;I’ve just got this really funny mental image of the Monopoly Man covered in wolfskin, calmly cutting into a human arm with a knife and fork!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Huh. I partly remember that one. I thought it ended with something like “the rich man watched from a distance until he starved to death.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;I like number 399. ‘A nun is raped. She screams and screams, but it does not stop. She bleeds onto her robes, and dies. Her god is a lie.’

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Fucking PWNED lol!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;“Her god is a lie.”

&gt;Hey, I take offence to that! ;P

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I’ve got it! Our old copy of 1TDJ. It’s dusty, and it’s definitely seen better days, but it’s just about held it together. I’ve found the joke I was remembering from earlier.

&gt;Number 679: *A dog loved its owner very much. One day, she lay down some food before it. The dog wanted the food very much, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down more food. The dog was very hungry, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down even more food. The dog was in terrible pain, but the owner did not let it eat. The dog watched the food. The dog smelled the food. The dog sat by the food until it starved to death. The dog loved its owner very much.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;poor doggo :( i du lik dese jokes tho so i got tha book tuk me ages 2 find it but its grate so funny!

&gt;i lik the 1s with no animals tho

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I think it gets funnier the more you read. You get past a barrier, remind yourself that no one is actually being hurt, and that sort of lets you laugh at it. Does that make sense?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;You’ve got that backwards. Your “barrier” is stopping you from actually enjoying yourself. The real fun comes after you’ve finished reading, when you don’t need the book any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;What do you mean?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;rofl @ no. 582!! a child is asked 2 go 2 bed. they ask 4 mor time up. their parents rip ther skin away!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;That’s really weird. I’ve just read #0852. It’s like a twisted mirror of that joke. *A child stands at the foot of their parents’ bed. The child bleeds. Their skin has been torn away. The parents weep. “Please don’t come to bed,” they cry. The child only smiles. They will always come to bed.*

&gt;That can’t be a coincidence, right? Is there come kind of narrative to this book?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;What if WE ARE THE NARRATIVE?! MIND = BLOWN!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Not a great medium for a narrative. Most people don’t read the jokes in order. Unless I guess it’s going for a whole “every experience is unique” deal, with each reader getting a different narrative based on the order they read the jokes in. I don’t really get that vibe from it though. I think you’re meant to just dip in and out of it when you want to. It’s more addictive that way, y’know?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;well im lovin it sooooo funny lol! gets bettr the mor u read

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I definitely agree with that. Although, I read the very last joke today. Have any of you guys looked at that one? Not what I expected. It’s a bit… weird.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;lol 2 dark 4 u? get off the forum u f@g

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Nah, like I said above, I don’t read joke books cover to cover. I think I flicked past it once, but it seemed pretty long, and it looked like it repeated itself a lot. Was it good weird or bad weird?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I’m not sure. I’ve read through it a few times now. It’s just a really odd one. I’ll try to copy it out (I’ll skip the middle bit, you’ll see why), but I guess you just have to read your own copy to get the full effect.

&gt;*#1000 – Once upon a time, there was a book of jokes. People read the book. They read jokes about death and rape and suffering, and they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed*

&gt;[It goes on like this for a few pages. I’ll skip to the final bit].

&gt;*The people laughed for a long, long time. They laughed until it hurt. Then they stopped laughing. The jokes in the book weren’t enough. They needed more than the book. They needed new jokes. They needed real jokes. They made their own jokes. And then they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed.*

&gt;It ends there. There are a couple of pages after it, but no text. I guess it’s a bit funny? In a sort of anti-humour kind of way?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I guess so. I do always wonder what those blank pages at the back are for. Do they expect you to add your own jokes or something?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;it kinda creeped me out @ 1st but then i read it in the book an its pretty funny. like i get it more on the page if tha makes sence

&gt;Definitely! I feel exactly the same! I don’t read any of the other jokes any more. Last one is by far the best. Really grows on you.

And that’s it. That’s the full thread. As far as I can tell, it’s the only one on the site, or anywhere else for that matter, that mentions ‘1000 Dark Jokes’. No, I don’t know what the deleted posts were, they were removed long before I got there. I can imagine, but I’d rather believe they weren’t what I think they probably were. In any case, of the users above, FG and StabbyPete don’t seem to have posted anywhere else after this. I’m pretty sure they were both banned. So was JewsInTheOven, but he kept posting after this. Nothing about the book, just troll drivel. DontTellMom stuck around for a long time, last active a few months ago, but didn’t reply to any private messages I sent. Neither did any of the others. It’s an old thread, they probably don’t use the forum anymore.

In any case, this is literally everything I know about ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make your Soul Rot’. Please, *please* tell me one of you knows about this book. I *need* to read it!

Edit: So since posting this, the original thread has been deleted. Not sure if that’s a coincidence, but seems pretty odd timing.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit2: You’re not going to believe this! The book is real! Someone sent me a copy! Don’t know who, but *thank you!!!* Been reading through a few of them, it’s exactly as described above. Weird, but it’s great knowing it really exists! Must have already read through a hundred or so, it really does get funnier the further in you get! Once I’m finished I’ll share my favourites!

Has Anyone Read ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? [Apparently there’s a joke book called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’](/r/JRHEvilInc), and I was wondering if anyone here had heard of it, because I seriously want to get my hands on a copy.

I’ve been into dark humour for as long as I can remember. No topic is off-limits. Terrorism. Slavery. Dead babies. Whatever. I don’t care about things being offensive; as long as it’s a good joke, I’m up for it.

So when I heard about ‘1000 Dark Jokes’, I knew I wanted to read it. The problem is, it doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. I’ve searched for hours online, I’ve looked on Amazon and Waterstones, I’ve scoured the local bookshops and libraries (Side note – I discovered that libraries are still a thing!). I even contacted some of the biggest libraries in the country and asked them to search through their stock. Nothing. There wasn’t a scrap of evidence that this book had ever been written.

Except for one forum.

It’s one I’ve been lurking in for a long time, but never got around to posting in. A celebration of grim jokes and gross-out humour. It’s where I’ve read some of the best material I’ve ever come across. And some of the most downright awful.

It’s called RapeAndPunnage.org

As I was browsing through it a few weeks ago, I stumbled across this old thread, which is the only mention of ‘1000 Dark Jokes’ that I’ve been able to find anywhere. I thought of trying to summarise it for you lot, but I may as well just copy/paste the whole thread – it’s not that long – and hopefully someone here will be able to give me some pointers. Who knows, you might even recognise a username or two!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I found a book today in the second hand shop at the bottom of my street. It caught my eye because of the title, and straight away I thought of you lot. It’s a jokebook, with a blank front cover, and a title in embossed, silvery-black print down the spine. It’s called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’.

&gt;I’ve read a few now. They don’t seem to be what I’d call ‘jokes’. More like… statements. Or like –

&gt;Okay, I’ll type a few out and show you what I mean.

&gt;*#0001 – A man walks up to his doctor. “Help me,” he screams, “my lungs are burning!”. He collapses to the floor, and begins to cough blood onto the doctor’s new shoes. The doctors spits on him and laughs.*

&gt;That’s it. That’s the first joke in the book. I read it about a dozen times trying to see what I’d missed, whether there was a pun I wasn’t getting or something. But that really does seem to be it. And they’re all like that.

&gt;*#0012 – An old lady sits on a quiet beach. In the distance, she sees a flock of birds gliding past. She weeps, for she knows she will die alone.*

&gt;What kind of punchline is that? The jokes don’t seem to really set up anything, beyond describing horrible things happening to random people.

&gt;*#0017* is just *A baby dies in agony*.

&gt;I have to admit, I did actually laugh at some of these. Not because they’re funny, but just from the sheer audacity of someone publishing this as a jokebook. But I’ve found I really enjoy reading through it, a couple dozen jokes at a time, while I’m on the bus or whatever. Do any of you guys own ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? Is there something I’m missing?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;LOL! Nvr heard of it but it sounds lik an absolute MINDFUCK! Got to get me a copy!! XD

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Its bettr thn any jokes uv evr cum up wth u pussy f@g!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;JITO, you’ve been warned before. Contribute to the discussion or not at all.

&gt;FG1988, I was really interested to see this get posted up. My sister had a copy of this, and we used to read it together after mom and dad had gone to bed. We were way too young, looking back. It’s probably what started me liking all of this sick shit come to think of it! Anyway, I’ll see if I can dig it out from somewhere. Out of interest, have you carried on reading it? Got any favorites?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Haha, can’t imagine a little kid reading this stuff! Some of it is proper intense! Do you remember the one about the cat, I think it was number thirty-something. Just a really detailed description of it being murdered.

&gt;My favourites are probably the ones that are less gruesome and more bizarre – they sort of leave you stunned for a moment wondering how anyone thought to print it!

&gt;Like *#0143 – A rich man and a poor man are standing on top of a mountain. The poor man says to the rich man, “We only have enough food to get one of us down the mountain”. The rich man says, “You should take it and go.” The poor man cries with gratitude, and promises to make a shrine to the rich man upon his arrival home. When the poor man is part way down the mountain, he is set upon by savage wolves, and killed. The rich man is among them. He feasts.*

&gt;I’ve just got this really funny mental image of the Monopoly Man covered in wolfskin, calmly cutting into a human arm with a knife and fork!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Huh. I partly remember that one. I thought it ended with something like “the rich man watched from a distance until he starved to death.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;I like number 399. ‘A nun is raped. She screams and screams, but it does not stop. She bleeds onto her robes, and dies. Her god is a lie.’

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Fucking PWNED lol!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;“Her god is a lie.”

&gt;Hey, I take offence to that! ;P

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I’ve got it! Our old copy of 1TDJ. It’s dusty, and it’s definitely seen better days, but it’s just about held it together. I’ve found the joke I was remembering from earlier.

&gt;Number 679: *A dog loved its owner very much. One day, she lay down some food before it. The dog wanted the food very much, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down more food. The dog was very hungry, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down even more food. The dog was in terrible pain, but the owner did not let it eat. The dog watched the food. The dog smelled the food. The dog sat by the food until it starved to death. The dog loved its owner very much.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;poor doggo :( i du lik dese jokes tho so i got tha book tuk me ages 2 find it but its grate so funny!

&gt;i lik the 1s with no animals tho

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I think it gets funnier the more you read. You get past a barrier, remind yourself that no one is actually being hurt, and that sort of lets you laugh at it. Does that make sense?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;You’ve got that backwards. Your “barrier” is stopping you from actually enjoying yourself. The real fun comes after you’ve finished reading, when you don’t need the book any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;What do you mean?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;rofl @ no. 582!! a child is asked 2 go 2 bed. they ask 4 mor time up. their parents rip ther skin away!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;That’s really weird. I’ve just read #0852. It’s like a twisted mirror of that joke. *A child stands at the foot of their parents’ bed. The child bleeds. Their skin has been torn away. The parents weep. “Please don’t come to bed,” they cry. The child only smiles. They will always come to bed.*

&gt;That can’t be a coincidence, right? Is there come kind of narrative to this book?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;What if WE ARE THE NARRATIVE?! MIND = BLOWN!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Not a great medium for a narrative. Most people don’t read the jokes in order. Unless I guess it’s going for a whole “every experience is unique” deal, with each reader getting a different narrative based on the order they read the jokes in. I don’t really get that vibe from it though. I think you’re meant to just dip in and out of it when you want to. It’s more addictive that way, y’know?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;well im lovin it sooooo funny lol! gets bettr the mor u read

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I definitely agree with that. Although, I read the very last joke today. Have any of you guys looked at that one? Not what I expected. It’s a bit… weird.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;lol 2 dark 4 u? get off the forum u f@g

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Nah, like I said above, I don’t read joke books cover to cover. I think I flicked past it once, but it seemed pretty long, and it looked like it repeated itself a lot. Was it good weird or bad weird?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I’m not sure. I’ve read through it a few times now. It’s just a really odd one. I’ll try to copy it out (I’ll skip the middle bit, you’ll see why), but I guess you just have to read your own copy to get the full effect.

There is a lot of abuse and bondage in this series. Do you think that will be retained in a TV series? Most of the abuse and bondage is of a non\-sexual nature, but it would still be shocking if it is not censored or toned down.  In the book it's possible to gloss over it, but in a TV show it would seem more graphic, unless they try to keep it off screen.  But abuse and bondage or the threat of abuse and bondage is central to the plot, the same way it's central to a movie like 12 Years a Slave.

Furthermore, there are times when "good" characters issue corporal punishment, or when "good" characters ask for corporal punishment.  It's not just something "bad" people do.  It's more like boys' schools or navies from the 19th century, when corporal punishment was taken for granted.  Except, of course, in WoT it's more of a girl thing, which would make it even more shocking.

The more I think about it the more I wonder how the TV show will deal with this.

What do you guys think of "~The War~" in fantasy? Sorry the title is terrible, lol. I can't think of what else to call it.

I've always enjoyed looking at cliches in different genres \(I don't know why, don't ask\) and before I started writing fantasy, I always used to roll my eyes at the trope of "The Great War^(TM)". Basically, this is where a fantasy world is heavily affected by some mega\-war, a lot of times in the distant past \(the Breaking of the World in WoT, Robert's Rebellion in GoT, First Wizarding War in Harry Potter, those wars from the Stormlight Archives that I don't remember the name of...\). The fact that they came up i*n every. singl*e. high fantasy novel really just rubbed me the wrong way.

Now I'm trying to write my first fantasy story and I've realized that none of it makes sense unless there was a giant historical war or if I completely rework a lot of the story, and I'm starting to wonder if maybe it isn't that huge past\-wars are lazy, but that some elements of fantasy kind of need a war to work? I dunno.

I've seen some jokes \(and other, harsher things\) calling this trope out on other forums, but I couldn't find anything when I searched back on this subreddit. I was just wondering how you guys feel about it. Cliched? Unimportant? Just right for the genre? What do you guys think?

[Spoilers: NS, EoTW, TGH] Finished New Spring for the first time, novel and graphic novel, my thoughts. Made a post 2 weeks back that I was reading New Spring for the first time after reading the main series: https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/8he7ki/after_reading_all_of_the_main_series_i_am_now/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

Well I finished it, then very quickly in a few hours read the graphic novel version of it.

As someone who previously read the series I found it quite interesting to read more about these characters but I feel that without the other 2 prequel novels that New Spring on it's own fails to add much substantial storytelling beyond expansion of the lore.

I loved seeing Moiraine, Lan, and Siuan as their younger selves and from their perspectives way before they had gained the full measure of their strength, yet I feel the pacing of the novel is in itself indicative of the main issues with RJ's writing style... as in it's very inconsistent. New Spring had several slow chapters of inner Tower drudgery and politics, that were interspersed with chapters such as **Changes** in which so much happens at an alarming speed that you wish there was more time to soak it all in. The ending itself felt rushed, not so much in the writing but just in it's unexpectedness. I recall right up to the penultimate chapter having no clue how this story was to resolve as it had left very little indication of what was to come as the true conflict in the story is masked layers deep behind the bigger plans of hunting for The Dragon Reborn. I won't say it ended poorly it just buried it's clues to it's final showdown very cleverly so as to give no clue how it would end. Yet despite all it still felt as if it was intended to be resumed in a following book that we sadly will never get.

As I recall there were plans for 3 prequel novels, New Spring being the first, followed by one following Tam al'Thor in the Aiel War and after, and the third one detailing the span between the end of New Spring and Moiraine locating Rand.

This is further compounded by the number of unanswered questions established during New Spring, such as the would-be assassin Gorthanes who is conveniently left glowering on a dock somewhere but very much still alive, or how and when Moiraine reconciles with the Tower after her sudden departure and inevitable penance. Did she return during the next 10 years that other Amyrlins were in power or after Siuan herself became Amyrlin and conveniently avoid the worst of her penance?

Ultimately I felt it was a good novel but it does little on it's own and serves more as a supplementary text to the main series, and while my understanding of those characters is perhaps richer and my knowledge of the world greater, I didn't feel it had any great A'ha! moments that proved the main story in any greater detail.

As for the graphic novel itself, I've had it sitting on my shelf for awhile, and waited until I read the main novel before looking at it. I did enjoy it quite a bit, and it has some gorgeous artwork up until the last one or two chapters when a sudden quality drop is noticed (different artists maybe?) Up to that point though the artwork is very rich and detailed and it was interesting to see how my mental image of characters and locations differed from the artistic renderings. I did not for instance imagine Siuan and Moiraine looking as similar as they do in the comic aside from hairstyles, and I imagined Bukama having a much gruffer look about him than simply an aged version of Lan as he was depicted. The other characters fit quite well to what I imagined and the depictions of the cities of Canluum, Chachin, and especially Tar Valon were awesome and I enjoyed the depiction of how The One Power was used as well as the versions of Trollocs though they seemed a little too human (not just in the eyes).

I still maintain my view that New Spring be read later in the series and not as an introduction, as I feel it lessens the mystery of Moiraine and Lan and her intentions for the Ta'veren of the Two Rivers, not to mention depicts them initially in a role where they are not at all in control of the situation as they do a much better job of casting the illusion of in the main sequence. Also while Rand being the Dragon Reborn is hardly considered a major spoiler of the series, I still feel it counts as one as while the breadcrumb trail leading to the revelation is quite massive, there is considerable doubt about the truth of it from Rand and his friends up until it's made all but unmistakable at the end of The Great Hunt (and in Mat's view even past then).

Now that I've officially read all fifteen novels I will now continue and re-read Eye of the World which I haven't read for about 10 years now. If anyone is interested I'd be happy to post my thoughts here again when I finish with that re-read.

Would love to hear other's opinions on New Spring as well.

[spoilers all] My interpretation of the trimurti in WoT Okay so, foreword bs aside, this is what I think - the three ta'veren are chosen by creator, wheel (preserver) and dark one (destroyer).

1. Perrin's analogy is the most obvious, him being blacksmith and all so I won't waste much time here. A thing to note however is that Brahma (creator) is said to have four heads with which he could see everything. Perrin in the series is as close as it gets with him being able to talk to wolves telepathically and being able to sense people's feelings - if not their complete thoughts.

2. Rand is a bit more interesting. What led me to think this is the fact that in the final battle, Rand decides that dark one is a necessary element for humanity and its absence is just as bad as the shadow's victory. So instead of killing the dark one (like someone else might have) he imprisons shai'tan again.

3. Mat is the most interesting one imo for two major reasons.
&gt;* Magic is in form of weaves. Mat is granted the terangreal to not be affected by it.
&gt;* His luck - he has all the luck in the world. The wheel favours him especially.

I do not consider myself a good presenter, hence such a ragged mess of a post, but I hope I got my point across. It's nothing groundbreaking of course, but it's still somewhat interesting and I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere. Thanks for reading.

About to finish The Wheel of Time series, looking for a new recommendation. Hello,

After the long trek of getting through the Wheel of Time series I am finally coming to the close of this amazing series. I'm on the final two hours so I'm ready to look for something new.

I've looked up lists but I'm having such a hard time deciding what to start on next. I only really enjoy Fantasy books. I thought about listening to the King Killer Chronicles again (read the books), but I have no idea when the third book is going to come out, I also was looking at the Assassin's Apprentice series.

Any other recommendations out there? I found that the reader also makes a big difference in the experience. I absolutely loved Michael Kramer's reading in the WoT, but had a hard time with Kate Redding sometimes. Although maybe it was because I didn't like the characters at times that she was reading for, lol.

Thanks!

Trying to get into audiobooks I have 2 audible credits I'm looking to use.  I mostly read fantasy-usually a series.  Normally when I consider an audiobook I think to myself that I wouldn't want to JUST listen to a whole series, and I would not want to read part of a series and listen to the other parts of the series.  So maybe I could use audiobooks as a re-read.  For this I was thinking kingkiller Chronicles since there are 2 books for my two credits and I enjoyed it.  It also seems to be a popular audio version.

Another idea would be to listen to a singular novel that I normally would not pick up but would probably enjoy.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Right now I'm reading gardens of the moon by Erikson and I am really enjoying it- I considered listening along but it is first in a large series.

For singular novels I haven't read elantris or warbreaker by sanderson yet, though I am a huge fan of him and have read stormlight and mistborn and wot.

Does anyone have any ideas for me?

[Spoilers ACOS] Some lore questions. I have a fairly long history with trying to read the WOT. I started reading it probably 15 or so years ago, but only made it to the beginning of TPOD. I tried to start again a couple of times \(I have read EOTW and TGH a number of times\), but never stuck with it. Earlier this decade when I was commuting a lot I did try the audiobooks and made it I think to TSR or TFOH.

I have trouble committing to audibooks, so I have started over, and I am making a public commitment to finally read the whole series \(especially since it has been completed\). I have now read the EOTW and I am roughly half way through TGH. I marked the thread with spoilers through ACOS, even if I don't remember many details past the first few books \(other than some of the major happenings\).

Here are my questions:

1\) What was the point of the EOTW? The channeler still seemed limited by him own ability \(I am assuming that is why Aginor caught on fire\), so Saidin being clean or unclean feels like it makes zero difference. A pool of clean Saidin that is still limited to the max throughput of the channeler just seems like it will slightly delay madness and thats it.

2\) "Ba'alzamon" tells Rand there have been times that the Dragon has chosen to be evil. Wouldn't that mean the world would be destroyed by the DO, and the cycle would have ended long ago?

3\) Whitecloaks are obviously well versed in the world \(and familiar with shadowspawn/world politics/etc\), but still act like all Aes Sedai are Darkfriends. I am fine with them mortally disagreeing with them, even to the point of open war, but I think it would be very clear to anyone who had their knowledge of the world that they are not Darkfriends \(as a whole...clearly not counting Black Ajah here\).

4\) Ingtar's TGH redemtion. Ingtar clearly seems excited by the prospect of killing Rand/Mat/Perrin in the prologue of TGH. I realize that "Ba'alzamon" does not specifically say which of the 3 is the DR \(he makes a comment about the DR right as he shows the 3\), but Ingtar seems almost gleeful at the prospect of murdering them. It just feels like anyone who talks like the did would not simply come back to the light. Not really a question here, just pointing out that I feel like his statement \(not the statement itself, but the clear excitement at the prospect of cold blooded murder\) made in the prologue of TGH kind of contradicts his ability to come back to the light.

5\) Gentling #1: Rand seems fearful of gentling so early in TGH, but at that point he did not really know the feeling of Saidin, wouldn't it have been fine for him to be gentled? He wouldn't really know what he is missing.

6\) Gentling #2: Does anyone have the ability to explain how a woman can gentle a man and vice\-versa? If they cannot sense the other one channeling, how can they affect their ability? Assuming they can access their ability to touch Saidin, how don't they walk around always trying to sense men who can channel all the time \(like some kind of Red Ajah radar\). Like Liandrin at Fal Dara, could she not have gentled Rand on the spot just by reaching out and feeling him with Saidar to see he was a male channeler?

Random comment: It bothers me that no one offers Rand/Mat/Perrin pipes when they smoke Tabac. They are clearly considered to be young men.

[Cosmere] Thoughts on my initial re-read of Oathbringer So having just finished my re\-~~read~~\-listen of* Oathbringe*r, I wanted to share my assorted thoughts.

* I actually gave *Warbreaker* a re\-~~read~~\-listen first. It was the very first non\-WoT book of Brandon’s that I read, and on revisiting it I was frankly unimpressed. It had its moments, but on the whole I give it a solid “meh.” \(Sorry Brandon, you know I love you.\) That being said, it REALLY made* Oathbringe*r a richer read. There were so many fine points regarding Vivenna/Azure, Zahel/Vasher, and Nightblood that I missed on my first read because it had been so long since I *read Warbr*eaker. It was also fun seeing Kaladin become so entranced by a painting by the same artist that so entranced Lightsong \(and possibly even the exact same painting.\) And for all that I wasn’t a big fa*n of Warbr*eaker, I really, really want a sequel. I am salivating to find out what happened to Vivenna and Vasher b*etween War*break*er and Way o*f Kings.

* So, Nightblood. I seem to recall reading somewhere that Nightblood \(which Vasher &amp; Denth and company created in part using knowledge of Shardblades\) kills across all three realms simultaneously: Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual. So what happens if you kill a Fused with Nightblood? Would this be an end\-run around the whole “can’t actually kill them because they keep resurrecting” thing? Also, I really want to see Szeth bring down a Thunderclast with a little scratch from Nightblood. I love the image of everyone standing openmouthed at how anticlimactic that would be.

* I wasn’t really that moved by the revelation that humanity was the original Voidbringers. One, because for lots of reasons it was obvious that humanity wasn’t native to Roshar, and two, because the symbolism of the Girl Who Looked Up wasn’t exactly subtle. But even knowing it in advance, I find I wasn’t moved to much sympathy for the notion that the Singers are the “rightful” residents of Roshar. I live in America, and while the Europeans obviously had no moral “right” to conquer the Americas, it’s still my home. Humanity and the Singers both have claim to live on Roshar, and moral wrongdoings hundreds of generations back aren’t really relevant. The Singers have \(potentially\) the moral high ground because of the whole enslavement thing, but attempting genocide trumps that. Until/unless they start trying to throw off Odium and the Fused and be prepared to live side by side with humans \(which most of the regular Singers seem ready to do\), I consider the humans to be more the good guys.

* Kaladin, Shallan, and Adolin. First of all, thank the Heralds that the love triangle was ended before it could really get going. I hate love triangles. Secondly, both Kaladin and Shallan are in desperate need of modern psychiatric help. Between Kaladin’s seasonal depressive disorder and general depression, and Shallan’s borderline multiple personality disorder and the PTSD both of them have, I really want to get both of them medication, months of therapy, and a box of puppies. Thankfully Adolin is there, doing exactly what is needed to keep both of them going.

* Anyone who asserts that Brandon basically writes YA fiction and isn’t willing to get rough has clearly not read the Kholinar sequence. Storms, between the little urchin using his last breath to tell Shallan that he hates her and all of Kaladin’s friends among the Singers and the Wall Guard killing each other, that was freakin’ brutal.

* Best moment in the book:

&gt;They looked out at the street and found Kaladin approaching along with what seemed to be an army of five or six hundred men, wearing the uniforms of the Wall Guard.
&gt;
&gt;Adolin sighed softly. “Of course. He’s probably their leader now or something. Storming bridgeboy.”

* Knowing the end of the book, there was a ton of foreshadowing that Dalinar was going to learn to read.

* Moash. I know it’s something of a meme, but seriously, fuck that guy. I wasn’t entirely *un*\-sympathetic to him, and this was enhanced by Odium whispering in his ear throughout this book. \(“*It wasn’t your fault…*”\) But then he gives Kaladin the Bridge 4 salute after killing Elhokar. Fuck you, Moash.

* Adolin must really be feeling like the odd man out, being the only Kholin that isn’t Radiant, not counting Navani \(a Kholin through marriage\) and Elhokar’s son \(who’s 3\). \(Elhokar counts. He only needed like 10 more seconds. Fuck you, Moash.\) So we’re all agreed that he’s going to in some way resurrect Mya and become an Edgedancer, right guys?

* Any theories on what the deal is with that Cryptic that Hoid found in Kholinar at the end?

* Kate Reading going “No mating!” has officially overtaken James Marsters shouting “Parkour!” as the funniest moment in audiobook history.

* Lastly, allow me to present [Timbre humming to the rhythm of victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3suGfhnT2Sg).

[The Path of Daggers] Is this really considered “Slog”? In my opinion this book is the one that has more events in the entire series, so far as I have read, the second being TFoH.

So many things happened and the book is pretty short (by WoT standards)

I mean what is this “Slog” that everyone talks about. I was scared as hell of starting this series because I heard that in some books like nothing happens, but while I am reading I haven’t seen it. I mean is this “Slog” that big of a deal, or I just haven’t reach it?

So about the book... This one was dark, Rand’s life really needs more light. I thought Dashiva was a cool guy, didn’t saw him being a darkfriend. Egwene finally progresses with the sitters, the Bawl of the Winds part was great.

All about the Seanchan was great, the strange way that the power behave near Ebu Dar, the asha’man, and Callandor, I thought he screwed up because he was near the city, but I’m glad that wasn’t because I liked that Callandor got nerfed. It was a way too powerful device.

I liked the focus the asha’man  get in this book. I have always wondered why aren’t all male channelers darkfriends and we saw a few. I always wondered if the madness affects them the same way or if it is like with The Forsaken.

I loved this book, and I have really enjoyed the series, ever since TSR I have going non stop.

There was no Mat in this book :( I missed him.

Sci-fi Fantasy I've read and greatly enjoyed The Sword of Truth series and WoT.  I am considering getting into the Malazan book series but heard off-putting things about the first book in the series.  Suggest me a book please!

Also - if there is any books of a similar vein that would also be enjoyable for a father reading to his 8 year old?

Difffering mental images of characters in WoT. I was just thinking about how us that read the wheel of time series (or any book for that matter) will create a mental image of a character based on what is given in both text and peronality.

I was especially thinking of how Loial is described. For some reason, despite what the books say, i always have a mental image of him as a Tauren from Wow. Am i alone in this?

I would be curious how you see him or have examples of other characters ( maybe animals/monsters)  that you think you see differently in your head than what others or the books say.

English is not my first language so please show mercy.

What the hell do I read next? - Want to read all 16 of Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings books.
- Riyria Revelations
- The Fifth Season
- Finish Oathbringer (i'm about halfway through the book and I fell asleep.. I love Sanderson)
- The First Law
- Pretty sure I still need to read KKC
- Gentleman Bastard
- Prince of Nothing

Not even sure if i'll like all of them, but worth a shot, there's just too many I want to read, and I don't know which to choose from.


I haven't read  WoT (not sure if I want to endure all the hair tugging that everyone talks about), Discworld or Malazan either (honestly Malazan is way too daunting)

[Spoiler Book 7] I've just finished aCoS (and LoC) and I keep sharing my first-time reader opinions So... What I believe was less than a month ago I finished and commented TFoH and I considered it a little wanting, in particular after the masterpiece that was TSR. Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/8bxquk/spoiler_book_5_ive_just_finished_reading_tfoh_and/

What happened next is that I finished LoC and without an internet connection I couldn't post my usual commentary. So, I started ACOS and I was well deep into it when I finally could post. I decided to finish it and post a two-books commentary, hope you'll like it!

I've read about a lot of fans so annoyed by book 7 that some of them abandoned the series. I find it awesome instead. LoC was a lot slower to read, but at least built up in the Dumai's Well battle which is one of the most epic fighting so far. ACOS on the contrary is awesome almost until the end, where the usual final battle was just... anticlimatic, to say the least. With a lot of new characters (most of them enemies), new POVs, characters dying, characters suffering and characters have some joyful moments., aCOS is my second favourite if not the best book of the series.

This time I'll comment on characters with a different order:


Morgase: I hate her chapters and I hate reading her thoughts. She was always described as a badass by everyone, but in the end she's just taking bad decisions and things that even Elayne wouldn't believe she did. I read her chapters without much attention, and I realized a few chapters later what was happening to her: she was being bullied, raped and beaten to the point she wants to jump from a window! Jordan describe all of this in such a subtle and elegant way that my brain didn't process it until after. I felt bad for her, a lot.

Rand: at last, he gets beaten and suffers from his bad decisions. The whole kidnapping thing was huge, and didn't expect anything like it. I also had a lot of doubts about the voice in his head being real or not, until Min finally reveals her vision. At least we know it is not becasuse of madness. Unlike Dasheva's.
When I thought he had learned to not do stupid things and taking stupid risks, he teleports to the rebel's camps in plain sight to a Padan Fain ready to stab him almost to death. Stupid stupid Rand. Luckly, with his ta'veren armor he manages to survive and turn things around by catching Sammael by surprise. And what a boring fight it was.
Again, Rand lucks out thanks to a stranger appearing (i am almost tempted to google who this guy is, but I am pretty sure he is evil since Rand couldn't feel his channeling) and Mashadar devouring Sammael leaving no corpse behind. Sammael didn't even cried. Rand, could you please at least check if he is really dead? I hope he is, I hated that guy.

Black Tower and Taim: how awesome are they? Grinding enemies like meat. That was the crudest scene of the series. A nice cherry on top of the already bloody fight in Dumai's Well.
Rand, could you please be more concerned of Taim and his boys? Taim is way too fishy for me.

Forsaken: what I learned in these two books is that they are simple humans, with immortality and knowledge of past ages, but still humans to the bone (and brains). They make lots of mistakes, they could have taken direct actions to achieve their goals. Instead, they scheme and plot against each others, letting Rand do whatever he pleases. I'm kind of let down by the forsaken. The super Myrddraal is way more interesting, with the new guy controlling Moghedein.

Nynaeve and Elayne: I was almost giving up with reading their chapters, with their sniffs and braid tugging and nose raising. Slow and boring to read. But then, The First Cup and Mashiara chapters arrived and they are my favourite chapters of the two books. Elayne finally facing the Ebou Dar Aes Sedai and telling them to shut the hell up. Satisfying.
On the other hand, Nynaeve removes her block by risking her life and submitting to the Power. Gets saved by Lan and love, love love &lt;3. The scene was so vivid in my head I almost cried. And I am a man. Damn you stone faced bastard. I also laughed a lot when Lan pointed out that anything he felt, his bonded Aes Sedai would feel it too. But in the end they get married and they are together. Hoorray for the Mandragorans!

Mat: He just wanted be left in peace, instead he keeps getting involved in bad situations. I have always enjoyed his chapters, they were action-paced and fun. In LOC it was not the case.
In ACOS it happened something that made me thing a lot.
Queen Tylin stalking him was something I found funny. It's like a punishment for a womanizer like Mat. But then he moved into the palace, and Tylin threatened him with a knife to the throat. He was raped. He was always with tears in his eyes after that. I felt bad for Morgase and I felt even worse for Mat. People around him also knew and almost got angry at him thinking it was one of his conquests. How sad. I still don't understand how people hate aCOS.

Egwene: LOC was her moment to finally shine. She is the Amyrlin now and she's using her wits and power to get things done. I love it. With Siuane and Leanna helping her she is almost making me like Aes Sedai. I also like Alvarin even if she is Black Ajah.

Cadsuane: Sorry Egwene, Siuane and Alvarin. My favourite Aes Sedai is now Cadsuane. I don't even know what to say about her. She's just epic.

Morairne: She's not coming back. When I read about her cousine I had my hope up. Now I just gave up. RIP

Perrin: your wife is now annoying. Her jelousy is repetitive, and also the way they make peace. Perrin is a big part of Rand's saving, but far from being a moment of glory. I liked how Perrin and Rand smoke their pipes and relax together in the gardens, but then a few days later Rand throws Perrin into a wall with the One Power.

Min: She's my favourite Randgirl, Aviendha my second and Elayne... I hate Elayne. There were some tense and intense romantic scenes and also a sort of build-up to the love making moment with Min and Aviendha. With Elayne it was just "hey let's start kissing behind the corners" and "let me send you two letters saying two different things, just to have fun".

Galina and Savanna: The most annoying Darkfriends. Their plans are so stupid.

Gareth Bryne: I love this guy. Planning to do what Arthur Hawking failed to do. Go Gareth go!

I have a little note for Elaida and Pedron Niall (RIP): I am now sure they are no Darkfriends. It's just that their vision of doing good is altered and this makes their characters interesting. Also, Elaida saw herself triumphant in her visions, but things aren't going that well...

Hopefully I will find that TPoD is another good book as aCoS and that internet's opinions on the 8th are wrong. Only time will tell!

(Spoilers Published) Whose pen do you like better? Robert Jordan's or GRRM? So since our lord and savior does not seem to be in a rush to publish TWOW, I started reading the Wheel of time series and now have proudly finished book one.
Besides picking up minor similarities, from trees that remember, ravens who spy on people, and a certain character with wolf dreams, I really like Jordan's style of writing. I believe his story is not nearly as good as ASOIAF, but his writing style is more appealing. Much less foodporn and much more clothing description, which helps the reader with drawing an image in mind.  Am I wrong or what?

P.S. For the love of all the holy, please do not spoil WOT. I have 12 more books to read and enjoy.

Wheel of Time fans: can I interest you in some free WoT books (including EotW signed by Jordan)? Figured I'd offer them free to a fellow Clevelander before seeing if Half Price Books would take them. Need space on my bookshelf, tired of the genre. Looking to get rid of:

New Spring (hardcover)
Eye of the World (paperback; SIGNED)
Dragon Reborn (paperback)
Shadow Rising (paperback)
Fires of Heaven (paperback)
Crown of Swords (smaller hardcover)
Winter's Heart (hardcover and smaller hardcover)
Crossroads of Twilight (hardcover)
Memory of Light (hardcover)

All except NS and EotW were bought used but are in decent condition. The aforementioned two were bought new.

I need someone to take all of them, please. If you take them to HPB and make $ I'd be happy for you. Let me know if you're interested, or if this post violates any rules. Thanks!

[Spoiler Book 2 Chapter 26] Rand is an idiot and other thoughts I'm reading through the WOT for the first time and decided to leave some commentary here just in case someone is also going through their first read through.

[I'm a few pages into Chapter 26 and had to stop reading to make this post and rant a little.](/s "After traveling through time and space just to retrieve the horn, Rand decides to leave the horn to go talk to Thom? Why not invite him to your inn? Why take Loial, the only other person who is large enough to put up a fight if someone comes for the horn?

&amp;nbsp;

After all the caution Rand took while getting to Cairhein, why would you let all that go?")

&amp;nbsp;

[Also, some thoughts on Selene.](/s "I wonder if she is Lanfear. She seemed to know a lot about the portal world for someone, 'who just happened to wake up in it.' She even know how the beasts behaved an how to kill them. The beasts themselves seem to appear only where Selene didn't want to go....suspicious if you ask me.")

The Better Plot : Malazan or WoT Malazan and Wheel of Time are two of the most popular series in the high fantasy genre. I know that Malazan is way more complex than WoT in prose and plot development. I don't have much idea about WoT but has heard people tell me it's just like LOTR( which had been an enjoyable read)
Ignoring the difficulty in reading and keeping track of the various storylines(which I suppose both the series should have  given the 3M+ word count) which of the two has the best plot/story?
It may sound like a strange question but although I love great characters, happening moments and edgy wars if the overall story wasn't rewarding enough it's a BIG disappointment for me

Reading WoT after Malazan Has anyone gone from the Malazan books to the WoT series? A good friend swears by WoT and I'm four books in and it still doesn't have its claws in me yet. I'm not, not enjoying it and I love how ancient the world feels but sometimes the characters \(especially Rand\) make me want tear my eyes out. Compared to Erikson's creations they feel a little flat.

Is it worth sticking with for a few more books?

I’m sure this has been discussed... but... I’ve just recently subscribed to this subreddit. In my short time here, I’ve been very impressed with the content and discussions. However, I’ve yet to see praise for the Kate Reading- and Michael Kramer-narrated Wheel Of Time audiobooks.

I’ve read the entire WoT series multiple times in my thirty years of life (and I can assure you that I have yet to reach the ideal number of read-throughs), but this time around I decided to chance it with the audiobooks. It turned out to be a fantastic decision, as I have now become enamored with Kate Reading and especially Michael Kramer. While I could go into minute detail about what, specifically, I love about their readings of Jordan’s epic, I hate to belabor the point of this post any further.

To the point, are most in this sub familiar with the audiobooks and as infatuated with Reading and Kramer? And if you don’t mind, tell me which character is particularly well done by Reading and Kramer in your opinion. For me, Kramer’s Mat is so spot on I find myself truly getting re-lost in Mat’s character all over again. And it’s fantastic! I feel Reading nails Morgase, for her parts.

Thanks for your time, let me know any thoughts you may have. What a wonderful series; truly vibrant in so many ways.

Just finished The Fires of Heaven, book five of 'The Wheel of Time', and I'm liking it, but not loving it. My reading repertoire isn't the most expansive, but I'm a fantasy buff. At 30y/o it has taken a long time for this series to even pop up on my radar, and every time I saw it in a "must read" type of list, I felt like I was behind. It's hard to discuss fantasy books on Reddit without someone mentioning WoT. So I decided to bite the bullet about 4 or 5 months ago.

(I would love someone to discuss the books with, as I read through them, if anyone out there is on a read-through. I am mostly progressing through via Audiobooks, willing to pause, or fast forward my reading for the sake of discussion)

Honest opinion (so far), in dot points:

- Love the prose. People use the phrase 'purple prose' and I think it's intended to be derogatory, but sometimes for me, as in the case of WoT, it's welcome.
- There are times when I feel like I'm only still reading because I *have* to have read this series to discuss the fantasy genre with other readers seriously.
- I think a lot of the characters are one dimensional, though that applies almost exclusively to the female characters.
- The male vs female motif was endearing in books one and two, to a degree. Now, I just wish there could be a male and female couple in the story who worked together collaboratively even *once*. Or, for that matter, a man and woman who agreed on even one thing, *something*. Anything. *Blood and bloody ashes,* just a couple who spoke honestly for once, or at the least candidly, or just bloody *politely*... about *anything*.
- I like the pacing overall. Except when it slows down to indulge character introspection - again, particularly with the consistently angry/fearful female characters.
- Book four has been my favorite so far. The characters were at their most compelling, so far. I'm feeling like it's not a popular opinion, but the Perrin storyline was my favorite. His relationship with Faile seemed authentic, and I loved the conflict in his character at not wanting to be a leader, but doing the best he could at it while people followed him anyway. It felt especially poignant when that led to their deaths, and I really bought into his personal struggle with that responsibility. Despite my misgivings about the females always being deceptive/manipulative/angry etc. I actually felt like Faile had real depth and substance, and her influence on Perrin felt satisfying.
- Overall, I love the development of the three boys. After Perrin, I particularly liked the growth of Rand as he is coming to terms with so much expectation and responsibility, especially when he decides to take some control back for the first time in the series in B-4.
- I've seen a lot of opinions saying that 6-10 are a slog. But I've also enjoyed parts which I've read are supposed the be the worst, so I don't know if it's going to be as bad as people say. On the other hand, I don't know if I want to hand over the next half-year to it, just to put my flag in the soil.

Friends, how did you get in to Fantasy, and what books do you have lined up to read? It was 2010, I was 22 years old and deployed to Northern Afghanistan. I was laying on my cot one day, and my buddy started talking to me about WOW. I had NO idea what language he was even speaking, so he just dropped a copy of R. A. Salvatore’s “Homeland” in my lap (sorry for formatting). He said “just read it, it’s really good”. I was crazy bored, and the mana and giant swords he had been talking about sort of piqued my interest.

Bam. Hooked. I couldn’t get enough of it. Luckily, his wife mailed him the next 10 or so books in the series, so I was never short of a quick mental escape. He was always 1 book ahead of me, and he did his best to tease me with all of the great things that happens in the plot line without spoiling it all.

So here I am. I have 2 book shelves slammed with books cued up to read. I’ve been working on ASOIAF casually since 2013, and I’m halfway through ADWD. Now, and since it’s summer, I just ordered Michael Crichton’s “Pirate Latitudes”, and Powers’ “On Stranger Tides”. I hope to have those two books finished by September, because I am dying to dig into Cook’s “Black Company” series.

Also, I read slow. I get it. And After Black Company is WOT! What about you all?

Thoughts about WoT? A couple of friends and I am reading through the Wheel of Time together and plan to podcast about it as we go. We all have read pieces of it here and there, but never from the beginning to the end, all the way through. In your opinion, does the series hold up, and in a world where grimdark seems to dominate, is this series still relevant to a broad range of readers? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this series that some people swear by and some seem to dismiss.

Computing Patterns in the Wheel of Time with NLP I just finished teaching a course focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I was happily able to use the Wheel of Time as a running example throughout many of the algorithms. Using NLP techniques, we saw how computation could help us start answering the following questions:

* Who are the main characters in the series?
* How similar is the writing of Jordan vs Sanderson?
* What completes the analogy MAT : TUON :: PERRIN : ???
* What were the major plot points?

Here are some of my recent blog posts filled with data visualizations and analysis, be warned they contain **spoilers** for the whole series. I was impressed with how much the algorithms could learn, each week in my class, I was excited to tell my students "Watch this, it actually works!"

Should Eye of the World be adapted as a horror series? I feel one of the big stumbling blocks for a WoT TV or movie adaptation is that Eye of the World may feel too derivative.  There's an incredibly strong thematic reason why Jordan made Eye of the World so much like Lord of the Rings and other stereotypical fantasy at the time, but that isn't going to translate well into television.  If the series comes off as nothing but stereotypical fantasy, it might not catch on all that well.  However, if it crossed over into other genres, might it succeed?


The Myrddraal, Trollocs, crows, Mashadar, and dream sequences could all fit right into a horror setting if done well, and it would allow WoT to stand out a bit.  What are your thoughts?

Where to buy the complete set, original cover art? So....I’m one of those who replaced a large physical library with a Nook as soon as they came out. And so I also got the email last week. Nooks, the original one, will no longer be supported. That’s okay, I’ve since settled so, where and no longer need to be so mobile. I have physical books again and I’d been looking for WoT books since last winter. Only I can’t find them now. I used to see them at the local thrift shops often enough but now it’s all Dr Phil books and keto recipe books.

Did the original covers become coveted? I love the awful artwork! Did the series have a resurge in popularity that I wasn’t aware of? Does anyone know a site where I’m likely to find them at a not-too-expensive price? I’ve been reading the series since the early 90s and do a re-read every year. School is out and I’m ready to start my summer off with the Emond’s Field crew but now I find that the Nook will be useless by the end of the month!

I’m a bit frazzled. Located in the U.S., if that helps. Paperback is terrific and funds are such that I’d love to find these guys at $1 or $2 per book. Am I out of luck?

Alanna (Spoilers all) I am on my third reread of WoT right now and something has been bothering me since the beginning. Is Alanna black ajah? There is something up with her, especially in the first 6 books. I know at the end she kinda redeems herself and Verin doesn’t mention her in her book but I wonder if Verin discovered Alanna was similar to her and decided to leave her be.

The first thing that I notice in the stories is during Egwene’s Accepted test. Afterwards, Alanna tries to get herself to wash dishes with Egwene and asks about Rand or something, and then Sheriam says something to the effect of, “Too many women are all too concerned with the Dragon Reborn.” Before she remembers Egwene is there and shoos her off. The only thing is that Alanna shouldn’t know who he is yet should she? Sheriam would know because she is black and she is talking with Alanna as if they both know who he is. Of course Sheriam would probably have more tact than that, being black ajah and all but it is still a weird scene that is suspicious.

Then afterward when Perrin meets up with Verin and Alanna in TSR, he remembers that Egwene said she knows too much about things she shouldn’t, probably talking about Rand. And then later on Verin says to him to not trust Alanna. Verin is trying to help in a small way because she can’t betray the black ajah openly but can give little hints, is it possible she discovered she is black ajah at this point and then as they spent more time together Verin discovers that Alanna is regretting her vows or something?

This would also be another reason for her to bond Rand, she could have been commanded to do it in the meeting in TGH. Of course, this would only work if she was like Verin because she helps Rand in the end and Verin would have to have figured it out, but it also gives her a reason to stealthily leave for wherever she got kidnapped in the borderlands before AMoL. I know it is probably a little farfetched all things considered but she is just so sketchy everytime I read through.

TLDR; Alanna is possibly black ajah, or she is just really sketchy.

Started Malazan and enjoying Gardens of the Moon - am I nuts? I'll try to avoid spoilers as much as possible, however, I got the urge to post about my experience starting on Malazan.

Just like many of you, I was very much on the fence about beginning the sojourn into the world of the Fallen due to a lot of the negative feedback about the first book. However, I am about half way through and I cannot put it down.

Here are a few of my reasons why I love it and hopefully some encouragement for someone wanting to start it.

The book definitely throws you into the middle of the action. Years mark the start of chapters, just when you feel you have your footing with the storyline suddenly you're thrust 200 years in the past or 50 years in the future. This can be disconcerting, especially if you're starting to get to grips with characters.

Speaking of characters, they are fantastic, you can see their emotions, drives, and desires just within a few pages of dialogue. However, Erikson gives out descriptions and details sparingly. There is no immediate description of the character and chapters may go by before you get to explore them again.

Some immediate details for decision making:
- Decide if you like realistic magic (I.E. Allomancy) or ethereal magic (Dragonlance and Drizzt)
- Do you like your gods to be faceless, mystic, and unassailable deities or anthropomorphic, flawed, and emotional?
- How necessary are descriptions upfront? Do you need characters described to the belt buckle right away?

Finally, the story. Within the first 100 pages, the story stops and starts several times.
A young boy will discover his destiny?
A fallen emperor and their heir? A detective mystery?
An assassin's tale?
An epic war of domination?
A covert mission?
A battle of the gods with humans as the pawns?

The truth is - the story is all of those plots at once and that's a lot to take in. Very intimidating. Garden of the Moon does not placate its readers with a nice linear progression. Instead, it's as if you walked into the middle of a conversation that's been going for hours between close friends.

This type of narration is not for everyone -- I've read GOT, WOT, WOK, LOTR, Drizzt, Dragonlance, and a slew of other epic fantasies. Erikson manages to deliver in a vexing and fresh style while keeping the spirit of Epic Fantasy very much alive. I can't wait to dive deeper into Malazan and I am encouraged that the books "Just get better".

[Spoiler Book 8] I've just finished tPoD and I keep sharing my first-time reader opinions  Looks like I hit the famous beginning of *slob*! But there are no beginnings nor endings in the weavings of the Wheel of Time, right?

For those curious about my comments of previous books, here's the link to Book 6 and 7:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/8li6ux/spoiler\_book\_7\_ive\_just\_finished\_acos\_and\_loc\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/8li6ux/spoiler_book_7_ive_just_finished_acos_and_loc_and/)

So... The prologue wasn't as long as the previous ones, but oh boy was it slow. Slow as the rest of 75&amp;#37; of the book.

Elayne: she cleanse the weather with the other magic ladies and it has her second moment of glory. She took a chance and exploded the Travel weave, sending Seanchan bits everywhere! I think she is now ready to take the Caemlyn throne. By the way, why the cleansing of the weather was so... flat? No celebration, nothing.

Aviendha: Another Aviendha POV! I love these. In particular, with this POV it's nice to see the other girls with a fresh prospective. So Nynaeve was not just stubborn, Elayne was brave, and so on...

Perrin/Faile: Thanks to user @MikeofthePalace I now see things for what they really are. All of the problems between Perrin and Faile are caused by Perrin's nose. I suggest you reading his comment in my previous post. So Faile was plotting something and everything failed because they all get kidnapped. Good luck with that, Perrin. Hopefully you'll deal with Sevanna and Galina because I can't stand their chapters anymore. Morgase and co are with them and I'm growing fond of Morgase. She's destroyed but does not give up yet.

Forsaken: We have a Nae'blis! Hail and glory! Now every other Forsaken is basically a slave. By the way, I don't recall in which chapter, but does the Dark One impose not to kill Rand?

Black Tower: Black coats, inhuman training, mass weapons of death. Taim is an evil genius and Rand is giving him too much power. If I called Taim fishy previously I now declare him plain evil. Dashiva and co betrayed Rand and attempted to kill him and I think the mind behind the attack is nonotherthan Taim himself. No Forsaken could have tried to kill him since they have a straight order from the Dark One. Rand chapter on the attack is actually pretty confusing and I had to reread it a couple of times.

Side note: At first I thought that this series was not that violent, compared to other series like ASoIaF. Then I realized, it is not violent in your face. It is dark, and corrupted, bad things happen all the time and when they are presented to your face they are nightmare inducing. Dumai Wells, the Black Tower training, Rand poisoning the Asha'man gone mad (Morr if I rememeber correctly.)... This is some serious and dark shit. Oh, and Logain! He's back in action and doing some strange things to Aes Sedai (?) Some kind of linking/Compulsion?

Egwene: Oh yeah bitch! We had to go through some slow\-ass chapters, but in the end it was worth it. Another epic moment, Egwene takes control of the Hall by outplaying Aes Sedai at their own game. Surely Siuan helped. In your face Romanda and Lelaine! Will we see the battle for the White Tower next book? I hope so.

Elaida: she's being controlled. I pity her.

Alviarin: she's being controlled. I pity her.

White Tower Aes Sedai: At last, somebody had the brilliant idea to test Aes Sedai with the Oath Rod. Revow the oaths and say you are not a Darkfriend. This is huge! A group of Aes Sedai can now coperate and it is official that Black Ajah is a thing. Their methods may be... not kind, but the final purpose is worth the dirty game.

Rand: I was starting to hate Rand at the start of the book. He was cocky, he was thinking to beat everyone at once, he thought himself on a level with the Creator. Well, big NOPE. He gets a defeat against the Seanchan, and not because of their power, but his. He suffers a lot every time he channels, he can't control his power and Lews Therin is getting more and more control over him. He has to work with Cadsuane at her own terms, and he gets betrayed by Dashiva and co. Cadsuane has to teach  him something, as foreseen by Min. Go Cadsuane, go!

In conclusion, this book wasn't that bad. Surely the worst one so far. It is unecessarely slow, but the alternation between slow and epic moments kept me motivated to go on, and it was worth it.

There's a lot of meat on the fire now, and I am expecting a lot from Winter's Heart. (another piece of slob according to many).

Thanks for reading!

P.S.: what is the title referring to? Is it a metaphor? Titles were more direct in previous books.

let's talk Malazan so [Malazan](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Malazan-Book-Fallen-ebook/dp/B00HL0MA3W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528763958&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=malazan) (kindle) is a [series](https://www.amazon.com/Malazan-Book-Fallen-10/dp/B00VZI5ZWO/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528764315&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=malazan) (books) is my #1 go to for reading when stoned, and i will explain. let me smoke a bowl first.

okay so Malazan is my #1 go to for reading when stoned because hello fantasy. now when it comes to fantasy there's so much to say, you know, i read lord of the rings the first two, the other one i never got around to finishing (but i should UGH) and then c'mon GAME OF THRONES ANYONE?! And I loved the brutality in that, the sex, the gore, the fighting and surprise deaths... and I must admit I read the first 5 of WoT (Where's our sub Matt Cauthon?!) and LOVED them but I started hitting that book 5\-9 boring hump that I couldn't get past (i tried Matt, I tried! maybe I'll try again, I do wonder what happened to Nynaeve...)

ten minutes later

but I finished GoT and I wanted more and we all know how that is... don't get me started. so I looked around and said fuck it, I want to get into a book series that's really long, and I researched longest series of books and found Malazan and saw genre: "Fantasy" and was like wait WHAT because it was the longest series on there (proof). So I found /r/malazan and checked it out on amazon and started it WAY back.

all I can say is don't start it. it's probably better, because this series will suck your soul, you will be reading it until 4 a.m. in the morning and being tired at work but not caring because when that dude became a dragon and fought the actual dragon I mean HOLY FUCK.

it's cheaper of you get the kindle version long term, but probably just get the paperback if you want to give it a shot, the first one is called Gardens of the Moon.

smoke a bowl and drop $80 on a book YO lmao

need hardened readers to help me with a recomandation :) Right of the bat, not looking for your run of the mill fantasy books. This time i'm looking for something else that has bugged me for a long time.

Have you seen the anime overlord? or Log Horizon? Have you read Robinson Crusoe? What I want is a fantasy book that centers or incorporates the following idea : A king/queen/mage/ (insert hero) has to rebuild its nation/city/castle, including both physical aspects ( actual building/mapping ) and logistical ( rebuilding the army, securing food, establishing relations).


OR



I would sattle for a book where the protagonist starts dirt poor and weak and at the end he manages to become rich and powerful. I have read WoT ( go Rand ) and Stormlight ( go Kaladin ), but this is not what I want, as Rand got his power and wealth only because -SPOILERS- he is the dragon reborn and Kaladin because Syl has a crush on him /s. -END OF SPOILERS-

I want a hero that has to fight for every silver coin, that has to push himself against the curent to reach the top. I want to be by his side every step of the journey and see him succed.

Thank you for reading my wall of text and I'm all too eagerly waiting for your recommandations :)

Wot and Amazon We finally have confirmation, at least unofficially, that Wheel of Time is going to be on Amazon. There's been a lot of talk about how the show is probably going to be a shitshow.

I am here today to talk about why we should have hope. The consensus for years was that the only way to do a Wheel of Time show was either get Game of Thrones level budgets, which nobody thought would happen, or do an animated series. Well now we know that Wheel of Time is getting a Game of Thrones style budget and people can't stop complaining.

I don't want this sub to become the fan base that is toxic and will hurt the chances for a Good Wheel of Time show. We know that fan support in online communities has brought shows back from the dead and has seriously shaped the way shows are produced.

Let's show Amazon before production really gets started that they have a group of people behind them that support them in their Endeavour and that we are a group that they can rely on for inspiration and good press.

I know that we've been waiting many years and have been shafted by swindlers when it comes to our favorite book series, I'm looking at you Red Eagle entertainment. But now we have the chance to share our favorite series with the world, and we should be better custodians of the property.

The show could have ended up on MTV or TNT. We could have gotten the Shannara Chronicles. But we are with a production that is willing to put the money into it, and has produced some very good television shows.

Adaptions of books are never a hundred percent faithful, so don't be upset that we're not going to get it, we're going to have the chance to see our favorite characters and our favorite scenes in front of us and we're going to be able to share it with the people we love because watching a TV show is way more accessible than reading of 14 book long series.

So thank you Amazon, we've been hurt in the past so we might be a little salty but we're thankful that you have the chance to produce something fantastic. And I for one will be leading the cheerleading squad.

If you could have one more book in the WoT universe what would you want? One more book in the universe, Age of legends, Artur Hawkwing, Jain Farstrider, Any time any place and anyone except it can’t be about the 3 Ta’veren.


My top choice is definitely Tam. This guy comes from a small village but unlike the three ta’veren, he doesn’t have the pattern helping him along with powers and luck, he just has to survive off his own skill. Goes on to become second in command of one of the most elite fighting forces outside the borderlands (a rank he achieves despite being both a commoner and a foreigner), Fights against Tear, the White cloaks, and the Aiel. We know of at least one event In the white cloak war where him and the companions pull off a daring attack to rescue the king of Illian. And they manage this despite being up against one of the great captains. The guy is on the same level as Lan, the major difference being after the Aiel War Tam got to go home and enjoy 20 years of peace.

Can you recommend Wheel of Time? Hello,

I have never read Wheel of Time. I have read a shitload of fantasy, and I think WoT is the only big daddy that I haven't gotten round to. I understand that for a lot of you it will be as simple as 'hell yes, go away'. However, on this subreddit I have seen quite a bit of criticism for the series, most commonly to do with the pacing of the books. So I have always stayed away, and know very little about the books other than that they are beloved by some, disliked by others, and very long.

So I would appreciate some level-headed opinions on the series as a whole, because if I start it I want to finish it.

Thanks in advance guys :)

Finally finished the series! Here are some thoughts...(spoilers all) It took about a year and a half, but I just finished AMOL yesterday and can finally say what a fantastic series. Now I can finally dive into theories and read up on all the things I missed ( I'm sure that is a giant list, I had a shit time keeping track of a lot of side characters). I also want to congratulate Brandon Sanderson for really doing a stellar job on that last three books. Even though his version of Mat was a little docuhey, BS took on a mammoth assignment and knocked it out of the park.

Some issues/ questions I have at the end:

-Padan Fain. This guy was an unbelievable character, but he was criminally under used. After book 2 it seemed like we only got a half a paragraph of Fain every two or three books. Those half paragraphs are some of the best parts of the series IMO, I loved how every time he pops back up he is more and more disturbing and farther gone into the darkness. When he shows up at Shayol Ghul with his minions and his Mashdar mist sucking up souls and wrecking havoc, I thought we were for sure going to get some next level evil doer shows up and fucks shit up chain of events, but then he gets killed almost instantly. I was disappointed by the overall lack of Fain.

-I think it would have been best to leave Moiraine dead. It would have been neat to see her come back as a part of the Heroes of the Horn bunch though, like Hawkwing says something to the tone of "sup Mat this is Moiraine the Forsaken Slayer and she's with us now, let's fuck shit up"

- Overall strategy of the first phase the last Battle. Elayne and the great captains want to eliminate the threat it Camelyn first, that makes sense. Why not send every available channeler, male and female, surround the city with gateways, and blast away with the power and with some dragons and archers/crossbowmen to boot? There were at least 250 Aes Sedai IIRC gathered for the last battle with at least twice as many when you combine the other one power wielding groups, so they should have been able to flatten Camelyn within a day from the safety of their gateways. They could have sent the regular soldiers to hold the line at the other fronts, then move the Alpha group of channelers to the Gap and obliterate that next in the same way. Then move onto Kandor and Shayol Ghul itself. Nope, instead they send Bashere with some dragons and some channelers and a bunch of regular ass dudes who end up fighting for weeks over two countries. Poorly handled, Elayne.

- Who exactly did kill Asmodean? I'm sure it must have been one of the Forsaken, but either I missed when his killer was revealed or it's still a mystery.

- Osan'gar was Aginor, and Aran'gar was Belthamel, right? I may have that backwards, but I seemed to remember Aginor being heavily implied as Osan'gar due to his love of being a sick twisted Dr Moreau type. That leaves a few options for Aran'gar, but I think Balthamel died in EOTW, so the timing makes sense. I got a lot of Forsaken mixed up in the beginning.

- Would anyone who was not in the cave at the end (Rand, Perrin, Nynaeve, Moiraine, and maybe Gaul and Thom as well) recognize Moridin? I loved Rand's new start, but I'm worried someone would see a Forsaken walking the streets then decide to put a handful of balefire up Rand's ass.

-Who was the old Aiel woman that Aviendha spoke to on her way back to Rhuidean? I can't remember her name and don't have the book with but, but my guess is she was the same woman that helped Rand out of the cave during the last few scenes? Tigraine?

- Did not like Faile, not one bit. I wish so bad that the last scene in the series was Perrin finding her dead then immediately going to Berelain's palace and banging the daylights out of her while Galad has to watch like some one handed cuck. Then, mid bang, the wolf truly comes out of Perrin and he rips Galad's throat out with his teeth right before finishing. I know that wouldn't have fit in really with the overall tone of the series, but if any of you write WoT fanfic erotica, please take that as a prompt and deliver me some smut.

- The Bowl of Winds plot took waaaaaaaaaaaaay too long.




I'm really excited that now I can pour through every fan theory and every piece of foreshadowing that you all have posted so I can feel like a total moron for missing these things the first time. I plan to re read the series, but I've got a back log of things to read and really wanna check of some of Sanderson's other work.

Question for veteran GOT fans Hi everyone, just a quick question. Before GOT made it big with HBO, and the books became super popular, how was the popularity and reputation of the series up to that point? In other words, was the series big in the 90s and early 2000s and just as/if not, more popular than WOT? How did Martin and his stories rank on the epic fantasy ladder? Was he as game-changing then as he's made out to be now, or has the HBO series exaggerated the impact of the books?

Frustrated that I struggled to get past the 2nd WoT book. I'm a pretty big fantasy lover and I've read too many fantasy books to even begin to list. Like everything in life, taste is a personal thing and naturally everyone loves different things even within a specific genre.

However I'm really frustrated that I can't seem to get into Wheel of Time and love it as much as so many people seem to do. I don't dislike it, I enjoyed the first and second book enough but I just couldn't get excited enough about it to read the next 12 books. I really want to love it though as it's such an important series to a genre that I love.

Anyway, I just wanted to share that and see if I'm as alone in the fantasy universe with my lack of WoT passion as I feel.

Understanding the wheel (massive spoilers/discussion regarding all books) First time posting

I recently finished Amol, and having fallen into the vast hollowness of sadness of not having anymore WOT to read, I've come here to ask a few questions that I've struggled with.

During the first 3 books Ishamael would often invade Rand's dreams and speak of how they had always battled through-out time. The the DO would finally break the wheel and end it forever. I recently ran into a thread talking about the ages that pass and what each one generally entailed. The bore is opened, LTT closes it and saidin is tainted, the age of legends ends, etc etc. Going all the way forward to Rand using a three-fold weave to bind the DO again. Rinse and repeat.

I'm not exactly sure where they got the info, but I was kind of thinking along the lines that it was in a sense foreshadowing that this would ultimately again come to pass. That the threads of the pattern would spit out LTT/Rand/Whoever he becomes when the ages are recycled. I wish I had bookmarked the post in question, or at least responded to it.

If this is the case what marks the end of an age, and at what point does the age recycle? Will it play out exactly the same way that it did the first time around? At the end of Amol I got the distinct impression alluding to this as, Rand in himself is the embodiment of the light, as the shadow always calls him Adversary, and why Rand was able to light the pipe at the end, as he has handled the threads of the pattern himself and woven realities together, he is as far as anyone who read the series is the only person to have done so, ommiting Nakomi (who we know nothing about at all).

This also of course illustrates the absolute importance of winning the last battle and not allowing the DO to win, as the result would be all threads would be destroyed and no rebirth would occur. It seemed as I was traveling these lines of thought that in itself lives didn't seem all that important, granted the individual would be lost but at it's the core a person is reborn again.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. I just have a huge hole in my heart and can't figure out how to fill it, so I thought I would find solace in the words of other people and their love of WOT.

Thanks for the read.

Have a question, and I don't know where else to go. Does anyone on this sub work in publishing or know anyone who works in the business. (Publishers, agents, etc.)

Ive been looking for someone who genuinly loves epic fantasy stories like The Wheel of Time, because im trying to get my own manuscript out there, but most agents seem to only be interested in finding the next hunger games or divergent, and most big publishing companies wont look twice at an untepresented author.

And im sorry if this post is wrong for this sub, but i love r/wot, i love spending time here, I love discussing these books and characters with all of you, and i didnt know where else to find people who genuinely love epic fantasy stories.

Ive searched and searched, but at this point id almost rather take my chances wading through a school of silverpike.

[Era 2]Came from Wheel of Time: Wayne + Melaan = Mat + Birgitte This isn't a fan theory that transcends worlds, don't worry :P  I'm just wondering if any other fans of both series feel these characters are *extremely* similar in their personalities and relationship dynamics?

Both men are ordinary fellows who make wise-cracking jokes about pretty much everything, no mater the severity of the situation.  Both women are "supernatural" of a sort, who defy the stereotype of seriousness and dignity that people expect out of their heroes, and instead bond/relate much more easily with down-to-earth, laid back people like Mat and Wayne.

Wayne's character is especially interesting to me, given how much Sanderson struggled to find Mat's voice when he first took over writing Wheel of Time.  I wonder if his experiences with Mat helped him give voice to Wayne once he began writing Era 2, the first book of which was published a year after he completed his 2nd WoT book.

[Spoilers ALL] Wheel of Time ebooks annotated with the Wikia wiki Hello, r/WoT!

**Note:** There are no spoilers in this post but some may be on the sites linked.

I've been working on something I think you'll all find very intriguing: converting articles from [Wikia](https://wot.wikia.com/wiki/A_beginning) into annotations on [xyAnnotations](https://annotations.xyfir.com/sets/42467), which can be integrated directly into ebooks and viewed in just about any ebook reader. It's really neat being able to just tap on a name or phrase or location within a book and have the wiki articles already loaded and available to view right there.

I made a [short video](https://youtu.be/MEwtfng3yEM) demonstrating it in action, and if you'd like to give it a try, I'd recommend starting [here](https://annotations.xyfir.com/sets/42467/read). I've also been working on creating annotations from other wikis for these and other popular books. You can see some of the annotations on my [xyAnnotations profile](https://annotations.xyfir.com/users/1).

As you can see, I've got a large part of the main articles transferred over, thanks to the [automated tool](https://github.com/Xyfir/annotate/tree/master/cli) I built. However, because it _is_ automated, there are some things that aren't quite right and I'd love to get some help improving the converted annotations. I need to do things like remove annotations that will never be highlighted within books, remove sections that are not relevant in the annotation format, fix searches so that more aliases are highlighted within books, and much more. Additionally, I also need help adding books, their covers, and their metadata to the xyAnnotations books database.

I'm a moderator on all of the Wheel of Time books and annotation sets on xyAnnotations so I can accept your changes or even make you a moderator as well if you're willing, able, and trustworthy. It'd be great to have some of the trusted members here moderating the related books and sets of annotations on xyAnnotations. There are a lot of books and series and authors I'm working on annotating so it's hard for me to properly manage all of these annotations and books without any help.

So if any of the Wheel of Time fans or scholars here are interested in helping out, just let me know and I can point you in the right direction. If you're just looking to get these annotations into your ebooks and are having trouble, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.

High Fantasy - Genre Defining Players Hi team

I wanted to see if I could get a thread going of the fantasy books that are the ‘essential fantasy readings’. I am not only talking in terms of quality, but I’m also interested in what people think are the defining books in the history of the genre.

I started out with Sanderson and Mistborn and then made my way through his collection. That led me to Robert Jordan and WoT, which I think has been the most significant series for me.

I’ve also really enjoyed Michael J. Sullivan, Robin Hobb and, to a point, Patrick Rothfuss.

Since the above I am finding myself scraping the barrel a bit. Absolutely no disrespect to them, as I’ve really enjoyed their writings, but now reading the likes of Scott Lynch, James Islington and Nicholas Eames. They are gooood.. but they all kind of feel like rehashes of the ultimate originals I mentioned above.

Anyway! Keen to hear your thoughts. Who should I give a go that are the real players, games changes in high fantasy?? Jordan? Martin? Tell me!!!

What are you reading ATM? I’m re-reading Elizabeth Haydon’s [Rhapsody: Child of Blood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261604.Rhapsody) for a small reading group I’m running as well as reading Robert Jordan’s [The Eye of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228665.The_Eye_of_the_World) solely because I keep hearing good things about this series and the possibility of Amazon developing it into a TV series.

So far TEOTW is a welcome change from all the grimdark fantasies I’ve been reading. I just finished Brian Lee Durfee’s [The Forgetting Moon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27206615-the-forgetting-moon?ac=1&amp;from_search=true) and, while I greatly enjoyed the novel, I needed something to bounce-me-back. I felt I didn’t want to stop reading altogether, for my summer break from my English BA I wanted to read books I’ve been putting-off. So the WoT seemed like it would fit the bill and it’s not disappointing so far. It feels like I’m reading Tolkien but a more modern Tolkien with the same “page-length” descriptions but interesting characters so far. Especially Moiraine.

*Rhapsody: Child of Blood* is a favorite of mine and I’m stoked to jump back into the series. The first book is one of my favorite fantasies of all time because of the lore introduction, the world-building and its based around the trio of characters and developing their relationship with one another. Also, not a lot of Ashe, which is a HUGE plus.

So what are you reading ATM?

Im just starting my swcknd read of WoT I am just at the very beginning of the EotW. This is my second "read" of WoT I finished my first about 1 month ago. It took me a long time to get started the first two books probably took about 6 months combined.

After I setteled that hump I positiviely devoured the whole thing. Due to my life style I almost exclusively listen to my series as audiobooks. So I did sprinkle the WoT with a few other series but nothing even came close.

Anyway I'm not sure how many people have experienced the audiobooks but burn me, Michael Kramer is simply masterful in his voice acting. I never would have realised it had I not started relistenung the series so soon after. My favorite part of WoT is the development of each individual player along the whole series and Kramer has it down completely. Just one example is Perrin he sounds so boy like in the beginning and I just keep thinking " this is not the Perrin I know"

Before I begin let me remind you that the scope of spoilers on this post is up to Knife of Dreams, please don't discuss anything after.

This one had quite a lot of action, definitely up there as one of my favorites. [The Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don](https://media1.tenor.com/images/eaaeb10bd18f64f4641f6497e2f30620/tenor.gif?itemid=3892199)

**Stuff I Liked**

* The Prince of Ravens: Knife of Dreams should be renamed All About Mat Cauthon and
Some Other Stories. Mat really dominated this book, to great effect. Everything about his storyline is interesting. His relationship with Tuon, the new Moiraine rescue plot, the reunion with the Band of the Red Hand are all compelling in their own right. Mat continues to prove his military genius as we see him invent camouflage, use guerrilla tactics, and utilize the first explosives. I loved seeing Aludra’s inventions in action and cannot wait until she busts out the cannons she’s been working on. The Band is quickly becoming the most dangerous non-Power using army in the world. Loved Tuon’s POV where she sees him as a general for the first time.

* Malden- Perrin proves that Mat isn’t the only Two Rivers boy who can come up with good battle plans. I’m happy he and Faile are reunited, mostly because Sevanna is awful and I hated going through Faile having to deal with her. Speaking of Faile, when she has her own POV and Perrin isn’t around to sniff her every emotion she is a lot more likeable. I thought her directing all the other women to leave the collapsed house before her was pretty honorable. The big question left for me is how Perrin and the Seanchan will play out. He and the newly promoted Lieutenant-General Tylee get along well, but the panacea note from Suroth is now useless (I wonder if that matters at all). Could he be the one to meet up with Galad?

* Semirhage- She finally reveals she has been Anath this whole time. I got spoiled on that reveal while reading COT but I had always wondered where she was hiding. She and Demandred were the only Forsaken whose locations were left a mystery and now we know, she’s been busy murdering the Empress of Seanchan.

* The Prologue- Galad earns a heron marked blade and a host of Whitecloaks to use. Rodel Ituralde figures out how to fight sul’dam without the Power. The Empress did not live forever. Lots of good stuff.

**Stuff I Didn’t Like**

* What is Perrin up to?: Despite Perrin the character's obsession over rescuing Faile, his storyline has been all over the place. He has gotten sidetracked way beyond his original task of dealing with Masema. There was that thing with the Darkhounds that never materialized. He got hit with an arrow but then it never got mentioned again. Most other major characters have hints at their larger scale importance but I can't figure out how Perrin will fit into Tarmon Gai'don. Also, after the awesomeness of his leaving behind the axe in COT I was a little disappointed to see Perrin jump straight into murder mode. I know he had no way of knowing Rolan was trying to help but he just up and hammers him brutally, which feels like a contradiction of that amazing character moment.

* Elayne's metagaming: Using Min's vision of Elayne's babies cheapens any danger. When she gets captured by a group of Black Sisters, Elayne just sits back and thinks "I'm fine, Min said so." Not exactly riveting conflict. To the point of Elayne getting captured, it almost seemed inevitable that her plan to arrest the two Black Sisters was going to go wrong. Classic Elayne overconfidence gets hundreds of people killed.

* The Battle of Loial’s Wedding: Blossoms of Fire, Deathgates, and Arrows of Fire kind of feel like cheating. Rand and Logain pretty much take out something like a hundred thousand Trollocs on their own. Traditional armies feel pretty pointless when you have this kind of killing power at your disposal. Makes Semirhage’s one little fireball she dehands Rand with seem pretty weak.

**Who I’d Like to See More Of**

* Taim: Let the Lord of Chaos rule. We know that he ordered one of the Darkfriend Asha’man to kill Rand but is this the first time we learn that Taim is a Darkfriend himself? And he has a whole room of full Asha’man laughing when he mentions the Lord of Chaos. Whether that means they all are Darkfriends or not, it can’t be good for Rand.

* Logain: I want to know how Min's viewing of him turns out. He's meant for glory.

* Egwene: She’s doing her best to topple Elaida from the inside. It’s my understanding that there’s a lot of Egwene in The Gathering Storm, which is exciting. All this time has been dedicated to White Tower vs Salidar and so I really want to see how things play out.

* Aviendha: Free of Elayne she's off to Arad Doman and hopefully more interesting stuff.

**Who I’d Like to See Less Of**

* Masema: I don't find him a compelling character right now. Sometimes I feel like Lews Therin screaming at Rand to kill Taim, "Perrin get rid of this clown!!" To continue my point about Perrin's arc being confusing, Aram turns against him rather abruptly. And I wish Perrin was forced to kill him rather than Aram taking Shaido arrows in the back, would be a tough moment to deal with.

* The Aybara t'Basheres: The dreaded Shaido plot is over but I'd still like a little break from these guys. Not anything against Perrin and Faile but I'm more into what's happening with the White Tower and with handless Rand.

**Miscellaneous**

* RIP Robert Jordan. We've now reached the final book written entirely by The Creator. The worldbuilding, the epic scale, the clearly apparent love, passion, and imagination behind this series is nothing short of amazing.

* Jordan had intended this to be the penultimate book and we see quite a few moments in this one that support that fact. With the dead walking that started in COT, to corridors shifting in the Tower and Caemlyn, and multiple chapters ending in “get ready for Tarmon Gai’don” moments you can see that Jordan was trying to use this book to set up A Memory of Light. I can only imagine how he thought he would fit everything in one book. In my experience Sanderson is a pretty efficient writer and he had to split it in three. Gonna get to New Spring first but I'm excited to see what Sanderson can do, I really liked Mistborn a lot.

* While I acknowledge misinformation is a common theme in the series I find Jordan's decisions on who knows what and when to be inconsistent. Consider how long it took the White Tower to find out about Dumai's Wells. It's true that Elaida's delegation never made it back but it seems odd that word of such a massive battle wouldn't get back to Tar Valon. Compare it to how much they know about the rebels who had to go all the way to Salidar and back, which is way farther than Dumai's Wells. I know the WH had eyes and ears among the rebels but it feels like a convenience for the sake of writing Elaida's storyline.

* I feel like addressing an issue I have with this sub and others like it. Often times when someone who is reading a series like this for the first time speculates or posits questions, people in the comments will give them the answers. Why would you do that? Part of the fun of reading a series like this is experiencing events for the first time. It's not always malicious but it's still spoiling. Like I'm not going to go into a Shadow Rising thread where someone wonders who the Daughter of the Nine Moons is and say oh yeah Mat's totally gonna get down with the Seanchan heir. I guess I just don't understand why someone would feel like they HAVE to go in and dump everything they know on a new reader.

* Elayne keeps thinking Guybon is hot and that got me thinking. You’d have to change Min’s visions of three lovers but wouldn’t it be interesting that after all this time thinking she is in love with Rand that she meets a man who she genuinely falls in love with? Her and Rand’s love plot is by far the least developed, they thought each other were hot back in the day now they are desperately in love. Elayne is like the high school girlfriend: not much else beyond the physical attraction. Aviendha is the college girlfriend: their love develops more organically. Min is the wife: totally ride or die, the most natural partner of his three ladies.

* Well the [Towers of Midnight cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/Towers_of_Midnight_hardcover.jpg) finally makes sense. Mat, Thom, and Noal are going to try to rescue Moiraine from the Tower of Ghenjei. It seems pretty much guaranteed that she is coming back, which I did not expect (and kind of hoped against). Min says Moiraine is the only viewing she ever got wrong, which I assume means Min thinks Moiraine's "death" was a contradiction. Plus Lanfear came back. I always though the Finns were in a kind of alternate dimension but the Tower is a real place. Is entering the Tower like going through the twisted doorway or do they actually physically live in there? We will see.

* Oh yeah, did I mention the [Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don](https://media.giphy.com/media/YKPPWItnufXSU/source.gif)?

WoT tabletop RPG campaign, ideas for plot? SPOILERS ALL My first reddit post, let me know if I screw up anywhere!
I’m currently designing a WoT-based tabletop RPG and would love to get some community input! I’m fleshing out the mechanics as I go (I’m using BESM 2.5 ed, melding with some D&amp;D expansion rules) but mechanics aside, the most difficult area for me in storyline. The campaign will take place post-Tarmon Gaidon to avoid my players messing with the main story of the series - they will be a new series of ta’veren to solve a new set of problems now that the Dragon Reborn is “dead”. I have a few ideas, and I don’t think I’ll have any issue creating interesting and semi-complex plots using RJ’s immense world and politics.

Some of the obvious plot lines:
1. The Seanchan Empire - this will most likely be the primary story. Fortuona and Mat reforming the Empire, with Fortuona gradually trying to find a solution to the sul’dam/damane problem as it’s hypocrisy becomes more known. Similar to the American civil war, there will be two factions.

2. Shara - another obvious choice, with a little more leeway for the GM as so little is confirmed about this area in the series.

3. Malkier - Nynaeve and Lan and probably Sharina taking back the Thousand Lakes.

4. Cadsuane as Amryrlin, the reformation of the WT and her interactions with Logain as the new M’Hael (Tamyrlin?).

There’s obviously many more: Elayne’s consolidation of the northern countries, the borderlanders finding their place in a world without a Blight (perhaps they launch a campaign to burn out the remaining shadowspawn?), Perrin and Faile ruling the Two Rivers and Saldaea, Min the Doomseer... the only character I intend to leave out altogether is Rand. That boy deserves a rest.

I appreciate any and all input, or questions about mechanics or intentions! Thanks :)

Every year I reread the WoT series. It was never intentional for the first few years but I guess I just kind of ritualised it after LOC was published. I'm just about to start reading TEOTW for the 25th time and I am brimful of excitement and anticipation.

Finished my fourth full read through over the past 2.5 years. Need something new. When I say "full read through" I mean the series proper.  On only two of those reads did I intermingle ICE's novels, and I have only read the Kharkanas prequels and the ICE prequels once as well.

Anyways, Just finished TCG for the fourth time, and I need a new epic. I did all of the above in a two year period. I am not posting this in /fantasy because I trust you folks to steer me right, considering we share a common love.

To give you an idea of what I am looking for, it would another epic series, that makes you think, but most importantly that fleshes out its characters. Alternatively, it could sacrifice some characterization for awesome world building (see Wheel of Time).

To get an idea of my tastes, I would say my favorite series other than Malazan would be WoT, Stormlight, Asoiaf and LOTR (I know, so basic), Dune, and Bakker's Second Apocalypse. Rothfuss' series is good but too little happens and he shows too little dedication to finishing. That said, his prose is excellent.

I did not particularly enjoy Black Company. I also did not really enjoy Mistborn. First Law was solid, but too short and basic for my tastes.

I am looking for multi-book series that will engage me like Malazan and, to a certain extent, WoT do. I know, most of them don't measure up. But I am probably missing a few, such as Robin Hobb who I have seen written about often.

Hit me up with any thoughts.

[Oathbringer] A rant about Sanderson\Stormlight This isn't an angry rant, but I don't like the way Sanderson handles Stormlight. (these are the only books of his I've read thus far, beyond WoT)
I love the world of Stormlight and the lore is awesome. The plot is great, a few of the characters I really enjoy (Dalinar, Wit, Kaladin in WoK) and there's something very immersive about his world and story.
However, I feel like he's not doing the best he can, somehow. He absolutely RUINS some of the characters I liked.

Syl started as this interesting creature that was kinda funny but had a real personality, but by Oathbringer she's this "spunky" quipy self-obsessed pest. Like when they're running from the other honorspren in Shadesmar, and she says something like "I knew they would find me! I'm just too interesting and amazing!" and she's like that during the whole book. I wasn't a fan of her during WoR but at least she had that struggle with Kaladin's honor.
Adolin is another character he absolutely butchered for me. I've always been a fan of the "prince with the famous parent" trope (Robb Stark, Gawyn Trakand to a FAR lesser extent, Bjorn Lothbrok, etc) and so Adolin was almost immediately interesting to me. And he had personality and depth in the first book. He fought against his father (not literally, of course) while fighting alongside him when it was important.
In WoR, Sanderson did a great job making me like him when in his POV, and making me hate him when reading Kaladin's POV. As Kaladin warmed up to him, so did I.
Come Oathbringer, Adolin is this way-too-lighthearted quipy guy who was WAY too into fashion all of a sudden. I know it was hinted at throughout the first two books, but it really gets kicked up here. Adolin, like many things in Oathbringer, felt suddenly childish and "wacky for the sake of fun".
During the Shadesmar stuff, I ACTUALLY felt like I was reading a Percy Jackson book, rather than a Stormlight book.

The first two books aren't grimdark, but they were hard and serious with almost the right balance of humor. Now everyone is either kicked up to "wacky" or they just insult each other in the name of "humor". (seriously, Shallan, you used to be so clever. Now you're making "jokes" about Kaladin's stench driving off the Fused?)
To Sanderson's credit, Oathbringer DOES have some seriously dark stuff (The Rift....dang...) and I LOVE certain twists this book delivers, and there are some great sequences, but all the character-warping and "fun!" feels brought the book severely down for me.

I don't mean to sound like I'm hating on Stormlight or Sanderson. I love Stormlight, and as I'm an aspiring author, Sanderson and his work is something I look up to, but I just needed to get my negative feelings on Oathbringer out to people who know what I mean.
Thanks for reading.

My WoT story... AKA Never tell a kid not to read. When I was in eighth grade, my English class went to the library to pick something out for our quarterly book reports.

I had already become an a pretty avid reader at that point.  My brother is eight years older than I am and I grew up around his interests in things like Dungeons and Dragons, Ultima, and other fantasy mainstays of the time.  I had in fact just finished the first three Dragonlance books the week before.  I had decided by that point that fantasy was my thing.

I was excited when I found that my small middle school library had four copies on a bottom shelf of a wide spined blue book titled The Eye of the World. I pulled it from the shelf and saw a brave party of adventures on the cover.  I knew my next book report.  Even it was a huge book!

I ran back to my table and started in.  A few minutes into the first pages, my teacher stepped behind and asked what I had chosen.

"I'm not sure yet.," I replied. "But the it's starting off good."

Then she said something that I took as a challenge for the rest of my life.

"Seems awful big.  Why not pick something smaller so you'll get it finished in time."

I tried to tell her that I could do it, but in the end I picked up something else instead. Fahrenheit 451, slopped two pages double spaced together, and got an A.  An annoyed A.

That summer I finished TEotW in a week and a half.  Fifteen years later, I threw my copy of the final chapter of The Wheel of Time across the room as I leapt from my chair in joy over, well, a couple of scenes.

Take that eighth grade.  Read whatever you want.

Can't decide what to read first... WoT , Broken Empire or Realm of the Elderlings So recently i picked up the first three books in The Wheel of Time, The first three books in Realm of the Elderlings (Farseer trilogy) and also the Broken Empire Trilogy. And i cant decide which to read first.

It's been a week now since i finished the Mistborn Trilogy and i have been back and forth on the above mentioned series.

I know at the end of the day it's an arbitrary decision, but does anybody have a recommended reading order?

Broken Empire seems like the logical choice seeing as its a Trilogy, but i worry that if i read that and then start WoT, it might seem slow and plodding in comparison.

Any advice is welcome

Any Christian fantasy novels that are actually good? I remember reading one series in high school that I liked, but couldn't remember the name and probably wouldn't like it if I reread it. I also read an early Stephen Lawhead sci-fi novel, but stopped after he spent a whole chapter describing how the main characters caught a fish. And of course, I've read C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.
Most other Christian fantasy novels that I've read or heard of are too heavy-handed--they're very preachy or everything's an obvious allegory for something else. I'm looking for something with a good storyline.
For reference, my favorite fantasy series' are WoT, ASOIAF, Dresden Files, Kingkiller Chronicles, The Witcher, and the Stormlight Archives.

Thoughts on Worm so Far So I just started reading worm this year, and after a few months of me trying to get into it, I finally reached arc 8 and now I’m in full fledged binge mode. I have a few thoughts/complaints on the serial so far, things I love/I’m meh about. Here I go...

First off, can we all just appreciate how freaking *long* worm is? I mean I’m only halfway through but I feel as if I’ve been taken on a huge journey so far.


Of course, it’s length also brings up some of my concerns. First of all, i think there are way too many fighting/action scenes. That probably could have been shortened or even cut out. An example that comes to mind might be the fight with leviathan. It basically took up a whole arc, and to be honest I think two or three chapters would have sufficed. My favourite part about Wiblyblobs writing is his characterization, and the action sequences, while obviously well written, cut out time that could be spent on character development. I guess what this really boils down to is a pacing issue, since the story has suddenly become relentless. I could go with a breather now and again.

By FAR my favourite part about Worm are the interludes. Taylor’s a great character, but i think some of the strongest characters in the series so far are the ones that have been focused on in the interludes. My specifically favourite ones so far...

-  Alexandria’s arc. The whole thing could almost work as a separate story, it ties off really nicely. Plus, Alexandria’s just awesome in every sense.

- anything with panacea and glory girl. They’re relationship has wot me disturbed and on the edge of my seat the whole time.

- 11 a-h. Actually my favourite part so far

- Alec’s interlude

Anyone else prefer the looks of the C6 Vette over the C7? Is it just me?

I feel like the improvements in the interior department was absolutely necessary, but the exterior is over styled IMO on the C7.

There is just something eternally sexy about a C6 ZR1, and IMO the LS series sound better at WOT than the LT series.

Audiobook reccs? Alright I've done my fair share of searching but wanted something more specific if thats alright.  I'm a fantasy beginner for the most part:

What I've listened to:

Stormlight archive:  Sooooooo good.  Its how I started off on fantasy.  Shallan and Dallinar are my girl/guys.  I know liking Shallan is controversial is but I think shes the most interested

Kings of the Wyld:  also amazingly good.  Cooper and the rest of his gang are hilarious and the action is awesome.

Riyria Revelsions:  Its the top thing I've ever read.  I loved the build up and the final 4 novels or so are perfection.  Royce and Hadrian are hilarious and every reference is amazing.  10/10 experience.

KKC Name of the Wind:  Meh.  I can already tell its gonna be a power fantasy and maybe other comments have got to my head but I stopped halfway thru it.

The Lies of Locke Lamora:  meh...  Seems like an unpopular opinion from my reading but its not really doing it for me.  I think I like some good characterization and development that i may not get frmo this book?  Only listened to an hour or so.

I'm in book 2 of Mistborn right now...  I seriously can't stand Sanderson right now and I loved stormlight...  THe amount of times characters 'flush' I actually can't stand it.  Also Vin was one of my favorites from last book but shes downright annoying now.  I think I'm more likely to like females but shes so bad...  I don't feel like continuing.

WoT book 1:  boring af.  don't recommend.   I think I'd prefer something modern but i really coundn't get through more then 4 or 5 chapters of this thing.  Yea I've heard the female/male aspect has reasoning but it was just too much for me.

Any reccs for a relatively new fantasy reader?  Hit me with them pls.  Malazan is pretty popular here but I'm not sure audio is the best way to experience it.  I think I'm a big fan of characterization in general and I think Malazan bounces around too much?

Other books I've put on my wishlist are Codex Alera and Age of Myths.  Let me know if you guys have anything else.

Hit me pls

First time trying the Mistweaver series. Do the similarities to Wheel or Time stop? I’m in the first two chapters of Mistborn the Final Empire and gosh there are already so many similarities to Wheel of Time.

-Steel Inquisitors and Myrdraal seem the same, especially with the messed up eyes.
-This Vin girl seems like you could literally pluck her directly from her book and replace her with Min from WoT, down to the name, sassy attitude, tomboy look, etc
-Mistweaving “ascends” the user the exact same way channeling does. The two phrases even sound the same.
-This mist that the skaa are afraid of sounds exactly like Machin’Shin, especially with the soul stealing myth surrounding it

I feel like there were more I just can’t list off the top of my head. Do the similarities stop? Did I just pick up a different book? Am I only noticing these similarities because I’m aware Sanderson finished off WoT? I’m just a little disappointed. I’m not a fantasy buff. I enjoy it, but I am not good at reading. Is this just the genre itself where everything sounds the exact same? Not trying to crap on anyone’s favorite series, just wondering! I know nothing, after all. Just the first chapter or two. Thanks!

[TOMT] [BOOK] Novel that had a sneak peek advertised on the back of one of Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME books. Genre: (High probably?)Fantasy/Medieval

Date of Publication: Anywhere from 1990-2010

Author: No idea.

Clues:
It was about a knight that was fighting in a huge battle and then fainted/died on the battlefield. After he came to, he saw he was alone in a place that might have been the battlefield at some point in time but i dont think it was explicitly mentioned in the prologue, but im pretty sure it was because he'd woken up to find moss growing over his armour and greenery all around where there shouldn't have been any signifying that maybe a LOT of time had passed. So he picked his sword up and walked on to uncover the mystery and this is where the sneak peek ended.

Most of the clues may not be 100% accurate but the main feeling i get is of a guy(knight) dying in a war somewhere and waking upto a place where there are little to no signs of the battle he just took part in and a feeling that he maybe in a different time.

So just as a minor note, i was in school at that time around 2007-08 and i was massively enjoying Wheel of Time because i had just finished LOTR and there was a mention of Robert Jordan somewhere in one of the books which led to me WOT. The school, which was a boarding one, had a library that had a really old school artwork(conan, red sonja)style, sort of faded, hardback, first print edition collection of the WOT series uptil the 9th or 10th book i think. And they really kept it well too with all plastic covers and rebinding and what not. Didn't appreciate it at that time how rare it was to actually see a hardback of a book like that then because where i come from, the bookshops didn't have good collections. Anyways back to the topic, after i had finished reading one of the books(maybe 4th or 5th onwards) i read the appendix and glossary which i always do, and here i noticed that there where prologues of other novels in the final pages too. So i found this story that i mentioned above but really couldn't remember.

The book must still be in the library at school and i would visit it if i could, just that its not convenient for me right now.

[Book 8] Grrr... the stuff I actually want to read about keeps happening offscreen I can't believe we didn't get to see Lan and Nynaeve's wedding! They're my favorite WoT couple. No, instead we had to make time for about a million glares and sniffs as the Aes Sedai, Kin, and Windfinders spend about forever walking a few miles to the farm.


Then, Rand gets a coded note from Mazrim Taim about "blackberry bushes" which is pretty obviously saying that Taim went recruiting for the Dragon Reborn in the Two Rivers. I have so many questions! Does Tam know? I've been waiting for Tam to find out about Rand for the entire series and you mean to tell me it happens off screen!

First full re read Hi all,
WoT was my favorite book in high school and University (99-04), it is for me a synonymous of my teenage years, I met wonderful friends thanks to that book, I even learned English (book 5 and following were not translated in French at that time, so I had to jump in and read it in English, which made my grade go from.C to A in a year 😁.... I have of course red all the following books, both RJ &amp; stevenson.
But I have never rered it.
Except for New Spring, and some chapters dealing with Lan, I have never re red one of the books.
This summer, I have time, and I need to evade after a particularly hard year for me. So I just ordered EotW and TGH, and I am thinking "garden-armchair-wot" is a good summer plan.

In your opinion, is there something particular to expect, do or not do for this first re read? Like taking notes, checking some website, pausing....

Thanks for ur kind advices!

A Couple of Observations during my Re-Read (Spoilers!) I just finish a re-read of *Eye of the World* and have moved on the *The Great Hunt*.  These are 3 quotes that stuck out for various reasons.

*" Poetry out of Lan? The man was like an onion; every time Rand thought he knew something about the*

*Warder, he discovered another layer underneath. "* I just laughed because I was reminded of Shrek... Sorry

*"Flowers can kill in the Blight, and leaves maim. There's a little thing called a Stick…”* I find this funny due to the connection between Brandon Sanderson and WOT, those who have read Sanderson’s Words of Radiance will understand..

*"The other woman went on as if she had not spoken."For me, it would be different. Even stilled, an*

*Amyrlin who has been pulled down cannot be allowed to wander about loose; she might be seen as a martyr, become a rallying point for opposition. Tetsuan and Bonwhin were kept in the White Tower as servants. Scullery maids, who could be pointed to as cautions as to what can happen to the mightiest. No one can rally around a woman who must scrub floors and pots all day. Pity her, yes, but not rally to her."* \- Except this is pretty much exactly what happened to Egwene and how she won back the Tower...

Which edition? I started reading WoT in middle school, but I loaned my original books to my cousin about 7 or 8 years ago and he moved to Texas. Never got them back but they were old and falling apart anyways. I listened to the last 3 books on Audible while they came out, so I haven't actually read all the books start to finish since book 11 was released. Wanting to buy all the books and do a full read through but not sure on which edition to get.

I like the idea of reading through the original prints like when I was a kid, but not sure how I feel about having those small books, with the small print, to hold and read at night. The new prints are larger, but I have heard about some mistakes and typos that might be annoying. Then ebook sounded nice, but heard it might be a problem looking at maps and flipping to the glossary. Once I get one I know will have to get the whole set in the same edition. Any input or other insights/recommendations would be welcome. Thanks.

I need reccomendetion... I finished WoT araound 6 months ago and I cant enjoy ANY fantasy book that I read. I read Dune (Its not exactly fantasy but it has a vibe like it) but it didnt keep me going. I read  Mistborn which seemed pretty avarage to me after seeing all those fans of it. I couldnt get in love with any characters and the "plot twists" seemed a bit forced. I am looking for a series that can bring me out of this depression any help?

I'm starting a re-read The last time I read it it took me from the end if 8th grade to mid 10th grade. I've always had a pretty high reading level for my age, but when I was 13, a lot of stuff went over my head. Now I'm going into my senior year and if I can tackle Great Expectations I can probably understand more of WoT. I really enjoyed it last time and I'm looking forward to enjoying it even more this time!

[Spoilers ToM] Finished Towers of Midnight Overall thoughts on the book? I liked it a lot, solid stuff, and I'm hyped to see how this journey is going to end. However, there are a few moments i felt were a bit "meh". In no particular order, here are some scenes i felt were a bit underwhelming.

&amp;nbps;

First of all, Perrin's trial with the whitecloaks. It didn't really feel like a trial. It just boiled down to Byar saying "He killed these two guys", Morgase asks  "Is that true?", Perrin saying "Yes, but I was defending my friends". And then Perrin is found guilty but nothing else really happens, and we just move on. Yes, it wrapped up this little story arc Perrin had with the whitecloaks, but i feel like it could've been done better.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, the gholam. I've no problems with how they took the thing down, it was a pretty "Mat" way of doing it in fact, i just feel that the subplot with the gholam never really went anywhere despite it being around for so long (in my opinion.)

&amp;nbsp;

Third, and this less something i found underwhelming and more so something i'm just confused about, and that is the romance between Thom and Moiraine. It's been quite a while since last time we saw Moiraine but I don't recall them ever having any real romantic relationship. Did i miss something, or did this just show up out of nowhere (asking all you re-readers)?

&amp;nbsp;

Fourth, this is also something i'd like clarified. In Verin's letter, she says that a bunch of shadowspawn were gonna come out of the waygate in Caemlyn, but didn't Loial detroy all the waygates known of in the world? Rand was the one to send him out on that mission and he **knew** there was one in Caemlyn, so how come that one's still intact, or are there for some reason **two** waygates in Caemlyn?

&amp;nbsp;

Apart from all this though, I liked this book a lot. And with the end of a WoT book, comes a fuckton of questions. What's happened to the Asha'man who go to Taim? Where is Logain? Did Aviendha see a possible future, or **THE** future? Are the Seanchan *seriously* going to attack the White Tower while Tarmon'gaidon happens? Is Rand going to have to fight against Egwene's armies? How was Mat saving the world by saving Moiraine? Is Lanfear a good guy? AND WHO THE FUCK KILLED ASMODEAN?!?! Will we ever know?

WOT question/Malazan comparison hey,
so this is a question for those of you who have read the entire WOT series, but bear in mind i am in the middle of book 6, so spoiler free please

what i want to know is if it keeps being so... teenager-friendly til the end. i mean i like the story and it keeps being just interesting enough to keep me reading, but somehow i find it too straightforward, standard good guys vs bad guys type of thing, with the good guys always managing to prevail and miraculously finding their way out of trouble... i don't really know how to put it, it's just bland, and the teenage drama sprinkled  in doesn't help either. the "violence" is impotent and the fighting scenes are kinda meh... i don't get that gritty feeling of the Malazan series so i think i made a mistake reading the series in the order that i did. So really, if i keep reading and it ends the way i think it will (good guys win, nobody ever dies and it's all a happy end), I would really consider it a waste of time.
can i hope it gets better?

[Spoilers All] Summaries of each of the books/Major objects Hey there! I have been attempting to draw a series of covers for the WoT, and I've been theming it around various objects. (The Eye of the World for book 1, the Horn of Valere for book 2, etc.) I've gotten preliminary sketches done for most of them, but I was wanting some definitive answers for each book. Here's what I have so far:

Book 1: The Eye of the World. Real simple. I thought of it as a well in a cave (might be misremembering, please tell me if I am), so it looks like that.

Book 2: The Horn of Valere. Again, simple. The first several are. It's being blown by mat, and all of him you can see is his hand gripping it.

Book 3: Callandor. It's floating in the air in the Heart of the Stone.

Book 4: A left/right (which one is the unusual one again?) arm with a dragon on it. Whose is it? Rand's or Couladin's?

Book 5: The twisted stone doorway. It shows flames through it, (pretty much only because of the title of the book,) and that's about it.

Book 6: The twisted stone ring. It's hung on a string in front of an indistinct background, and through it you can see the Heart of the Stone with Callandor thrust into the floor.

Book 7: The Seanchan spear on an indistinct background.

Book 8: A cracked DO seal on a white cloth on a wooden table.

Book 9: The male (maybe with female) Choedan Kal figurine(s).

Book 10: Perrin's Axe thrust into the stump. Such a powerful scene that even the new covers have it!

Book 11: The Oath Rod? Couldn't think of a visually interesting enough one for this, but wasn't that a major thing here, what with Faile wanting it and everything?

Book 12: Rand's Flag. Red with the Yin/Yang minus center dots.

Book 13: The Ashandarei thrust into a metal wall with light pouring out of the cracks. Suitably epic.

Book 14. Rand's right hand holding Callandor in front of Shayol Ghul.

The Wheel of Time So I've been reading a lot of fantasy lately...including Malazan, Elderlings, Prince of Thorns, Stormlight (and other Sanderson works)Thomas Covenant and Kingkiller Chronicles...
I've read at least the first books in all these series and plan to start focussing on each one now more individually, starting with Elderlings, which I find at this stage the most fascinating.

I've always wondered about WoT...I've heard very mixed things. Some say it's an absolute genre defining classic, some say it's a bit trite, childish and cheesy. Because of this I'm kind of wishing I'd read it first before really getting my teeth into the fantasy genre as I'm afraid of finding it lacking compared to the depth of what I'm currently reading.

My question is...should I read it? Is it worth it? What are your thoughts? What are it's strengths or weaknesses? Whether you like it or not, I would love to know why and how it compares to other series for you!

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

Feeling in a fantasy rut lately. Looking for recommendations Lately I have been feeling In a bit of a rut with fantasy books specifically, which is rare  for me. Feels like I have read all the common recommendations and lots of uncommon ones, and don't know where else to go. I read pretty quickly and have \~90 minutes a day on the train, which for some reason makes me lean towards series, but I like plenty of stand-alones, especially longer ones.

* **Are you new to Fantasy or have you read many of the greatest hits?**

Read most of the greatest hits, at 27.5/30 of r/fantasy's top 2017 books (never read Tigana or Lightbringer, only read first 3 of Realms of the Elderlings), and many of the rest of the list. Read lots of science fiction too and enjoy that as well.

* **What traits do you most value in books, for example: Characterization, Prose, Story, Setting, etc.?**

Story, setting, characterization, prose in order. As long as I can understand character's motivation I'm fine. I also like books that let you explore and discover for your self what is happening (Malazan, WoT, Stormlight). Also enjoy varied PoV, but if it's 1 character that can be great too if the character is enjoyable and discovering themselves a bit.

* **What are some books that you read and enjoyed and what did you like about them?**

Beyond the big classics (aSoIaF, Stormlight, Wheel of Time)
Malazan: slow to start but loved it by the end, big DND player, so that fit. Loved the characters, the unique magic system.
Blade itself trilogy: flipped tropes on their head, lots of fun
Red Rising: YA but not overly so, page turner for sure
Dresden: fun, great setting, love the characters and writing style.
Fifth Season: super interesting world, interesting character's, really great mystery that unfolds as you read.
Kings of Paradise: Just read this, seems like a deep setting with interesting characters, and looking forward to seeing where it goes

* **What are some books you read and disliked and what did you dislike about them?**

Dies the fire (only read first 3): loved the setting a lot, but characters felt pretty flat and the writing was very simplistic.
Prince of nothing: too sprawling, felt it was almost too epic with characters I didn't care for, and was too dark.
Ready player one: simplistic writing, a bit too YA, certainly enjoyed the setting though, as a big DND player.
Black company (after the first 3): lost steam, the story sort of fell apart
Liveship traders: got probably 15&amp;#37; in, and wasn't into it and put it down. Liked the assassin's apprentice trilogy decently.

* **Are you looking for a series or a standalone novel?**

Either is fine.

* **If a series, does it need to be completed?**

No but I'd rather not start (another) series that has 1 book done of a planned 10.

* **Are you interested in classics, modern works, or does it not matter?**

Doesn't matter

* **What manner of tone? Lighthearted, grimdark, or something in between?**

Probably in between with a leaning towards darker. Having said that, love discworld and first law pretty equally, so hard to say really. Prince of nothing was a bit too dark for me.

* **What complexity and depth level? Simpler, straightforward, and easy to digest; or sprawling epic spanning multiple continents and thousands of years?**

Nothing too simple, but other than that I'm into anything.

Thanks in advance for your recommendations everyone!

New Fantasy Series I always struggle with picking my next series when i'm done one.  I just finished WoT and am looking for recommendations.


I'm looking for easy reads with very good plot.  I also tend to like growth of the protagonist wizard from powerless to uber-powered (like Belgariad/Belgarion, Rand from WoT, Pug from Feist series).

I generally don't like series where the writer goes way into description of environment with relative lack of plot movement or the writing gets flowery / filled with metaphors (ie this is my impression of Earthsea from trying one book).  I also don't want books that are hard to follow as i generally read on vacations a lot and then put the series down for months (this is my impression of the Malazan series from what people have said here)

I also would like a series that is complete.

Here are some of my favorite  series:

 \- Chronicals of Thomas  Covenant (Donaldson)

\- Belgariad  (Eddings)

\- Wheel of Time (Jordan/Sanderson)

\- Riftwar Saga (Feist - the original 5 book series, some of the add ons that i read weren't so great)

Thanks!

Enslaving The One Power wielders [So on my first 2 reads of WoT I have loathed the Seanchan. Their enslavement, how awful they are to women channelers, and them seeming like an obvious villain. One thing I paid more attention to on this reread were the characters I did not like to try and see them in a different way. This was inspired by a Faile post a long while ago that changed my viewpoint on her entirely.

Egwene and company say nothing justifies Damane yet then enslave a Forsaken. Rand also binds Asmodean to his will in a way that may not be the same as a Damane, but close enough.

What is the difference in their doing it and the Seanchan doing it? Oh and I am sure we could come up with all sorts of good reasons as to "why it is correct" but this series is not truly a jaunt through right and wrong it is a jaunt through conviction and will. The Seanchan believe what they believe with all their being and are no Darkfriends (on the whole). Rand and Nynaeve believe what they are doing regardless what they feel and say about being collared.

To step back and not root for one side or the other makes all of the characters a lot more nuanced. More so than I originally picked up on and then projected.](/s "This is a spoiler")

Ascendent series - just finished book 3 After finishing book 2 and being horrified to discover that there was no book 3 yet, it came out within a couple of months.
Now, I think (possible weak spoilers) that it's all wrapped up, and pretty satisfactorily. My only complaints are that by the end of book 2 I was expecting it to never end, and suddenly book 3 changed pace significantly and suddenly sorted everything out. A couple of reasonably significant characters seemed to just disappear from book 3, which seemed odd.
Regardless, despite being a fairly trope-rich environment, it was an enjoyable read with none of the overly arduous waiting that was required in GoT or WoT.

[Spoilers] prediction about Tam Hey everyone. So I started reading the WoT series about 2 weeks ago. I've been thinking about it (and reading it) non-stop. I'm currently about 200 pages into book 3. One thing I've thought about is how Tam managed to find Rand as a baby.

Tam entered the Illian military, as the book tells us, and found a baby that he couldn't leave behind during the Aeil war on the slopes of Dragonmount. I think that Tam is a man who can channel, allowing him to recognize Rand's ability (just as Moraine could recognize the ability to channel in Egwene and Nynaeve).

The reason I think this is due to a series of coincidences. It just so happens that Tam became a blade master, and his son who bears no blood relation to him also essentially becomes a blade master (he bested one in Falme at the end of book two). Rand uses the one power to enhance his sword and bow abilities. It's possible that Tam did the same thing, especially since he was well aware of the idea of the "flame and the void." Furthermore, Tam somehow obtained a heron-marked sword  made of heartstone. It's possibly that he wasn't aware of the rarity of the sword, but I think that Tam knows a lot more about the world (and history) than any small town farmer should. This leads me to the conclusion that Tam is a man who can channel but has avoided madness.

Let me know what you guys think, but no spoilers please!!!

What's the best way to find new books/authors? I think I have already read all the " Big Ones ",  (ASOIF, WOT, MST, etc). ( And yes, Malazan.) I have read Dragonlance, and Forgotten Realms. I've read most of the " New Big Ones " , ( Ryria, Ready Player One).
I want something new , but my old method of randomly wandering around  Barnes and Noble no longer works. How do you guys find what to read next?

[TWoK][WoR][OB] Food for Theory Crafting! - A list of possible unresolved foreshadowing. TWoK edition. I absolutely love this series. I've read all three books and I came to Brandon from Wheel of Time. So it's wonderful experiencing the series coming out and evolving while I'm involved whereas with WoT I only read it once it was all done.

If there's one thing I've noticed about his writing style, it's that he has two levels of foreshadowing. There's the obvious stuff like syl hinting that she doesn't remember everything and might remember it in the future. Then there's the stuff that the man hides throughout his writing, you don't even realize that it's foreshadowing until it reveals itself and your like wait I feel like I heard of this before. Ex. peppering the books with the names of the unmade without explaining what they are, and then throwing them right out there in Oathbringer.

I've recently ran out of things to read (and money to buy new books) so I decided to reread the whole series except this time I'm documenting every single bit of hidden forshadowing. Mind you it's only the things that haven't been ousted yet as of OB. Also I'm not including the obvious foreshadowing like "OMG WHO IS THE SIBLING" "WHAT ARE THE HERALDS" "WHY IS KALADIN SUCH A WHINYBRO" I've only just finished TWoK this morning and I plan to do one for WoR and OB as well however being that it's the first book in the saga I don't know if the others will be as long a list as this one is.

Without further ado.

*Note: I lost my notes for the first bit of the book so I'm reciting from memory. This part, unfortunately, may be incomplete.*
* Kaladin's maternal grandparents are mentions multiple times throughout the book. All we really know about them is that they're probably in Karbranth they don't like Leran and they offered Hesina money when they were struggling in Hearthstone. *My guess is that Hesina is the daughter of a wealthy darkeyes who married a lighteyes.*
* Kabsal notes that Jasnah has corrupted others before shallan. Who what why, We'll know more when we get a Jasnah flashback book I think.
* Shallan notes the anger in Jasnah when she vaporizes the thugs in Karbranth and hints that Jasnah must have been abused somehow in the past (By men?)

*This is the biggest part of my lost notes. I'll try to update when I find them. Everything after this point was recorded in detail.*

* Chapter 40 Kaladin mentions only ever meeting one other Azish besides Sigzil, however this other Azish was never seen in the book as of yet. It seems small but this is the kind of thing that Brandon is excellent at hiding I feel like this will come up in the future.
* Chapter 40. It's mentioned that the Parshendi hadn't fought much before the vengeance pact, except against other clans. Could this be an allusion to their life before the war? Were there other clans out there besides our singers on the shattered plains?
* Chapter 40. Sigzil was made a bridgeman for trying to kill someone and we still don't know who?
* Chapter 42. Different kinds of voidbringers who we may not have seen yet are mentioned: Raspings, Stormwhispers, and nightspren
* Chapter 54 Hoid talks about the Dysian aimians. We already know that they are big masses of cremlings but the way Hoid quotes it "Then combine them back together into something else," it makes it seem like they can rearrange their anatomy based on how they want their cremlings to move.
* On the same page Hoid says "I hope to return. I'll do so if I'm not killed. Probably will anyway." [Warbreaker](#s "So does this mean he can reanimate himself like a returned or something?")
* Chapter 54 Small thing but we never figured out what Hatham wanted from Au-nak the Natan at the feast it's hinted that only Sebarial is really concerned with commerce so it's probably not a trade deal?
* Same page Sesemalex Dar is thought to be a gift to the Emuli from the Heralds. Does that mean that the Heralds somehow created the patterns of the Dawn cities?
* Chapter 56 It's mentioned that Alethkar frequently has to protect itself from the Akak Reshi. Who are they? Why are they called the *Akak* Reshi instead of just the Reshi and what do they want?
* Chapter 57 Hoid: "I began life as a thought a concept words on a page" I have no idea what this could mean but I'm putting it here anyway. Maybe Hoid broke the 4th wall and knows he's in a book lol.
* Chapter 57 We still don't know anything about why Hoid was training Sigzil or how they met.
* Chapter 57 Syl mentions she's taking something from Kaladin as part of the Nahel bond.
* Chapter 59 This is a fun one. Lopen talks about his cousins a lot sure but everything he's said no matter how weird has turned out true. He mentions one of his cousins who makes a drink for people who lost their wits. Some kind of invested drink to cure madness?
* Chapter 60 Dalinar's vision this time features Nohadon talking about the Surgebinders and that they have no common core morals. Could the nature of the Nahel bond have been different before the Radiants were founded.
* Chapter 61 Renarin Mentions the Seedstones. That they were stones touched by the Heralds themselves.
* Chapter 62 Kaladin muses that he failed Tarah like he failed Tien and Dallat but that she probably isn't dead like them.
* Chapter 71 Taravangian Mentions the Lifebrother. Szeth calls him a vorin god. Could he be Honor or could he be something completely different.
* Chapter 75 Honor mentions in Dalinars vision that Humans will have a harder time surviving without the Dawnshards but what in keleks breath are the Dawnshards?

Fun facts:
* Everytime a veil is mentioned in Shallan's chapters it's capitallized. Could Shallan have been veil before and forgot after she pushed away her memories?

* I recorded the pages of Kaladin's Windrunner words if you want to find them. 1st: page 841 2nd: page 926


Conclusion, This was fun. My list ended up a lot longer than I thought and I'll certainly be doing this again for WoR and OB. Let me know what you think! Feel free to disprove anything I've written or add anything you like!

What is the best service to listen to the WOT Audiobooks? I am an audio book virgin - I have not listened to one since some random harry potter book on CDs.

I am interested in doing a casual listen threw the WOT audio books on my work commutes. However I dont really enjoy the though to Audible. Perhaps i'm missing something but audible seems excessively expensive. $15 a month for a single book per month? Seems outrageous.

Is there some other service I can use to buy only the WOT books a bit cheaper than that?

Was the ending was too abrupt? I just finished WoT for the first time and while I thought the last book was great (Branderson really revitalised the series after the slog that was books 8 -11), I couldn't help feeling the ending was a bit abrupt.

I would have really liked to have the characters' directions played out a bit more to see what happens after the Last Battle and in its wake. Perrin is my favourite character, and reading him find Faile and... well that's it, was really disappointing.

That's just one example, but there also seemed to be a few loose ends;

Do the Tinkers ever find 'the song'?

Who is Nakomi (though a few posts on here kind of hint that no one knows for sure and that it's a guarded secret)

How did Rand and Moridin 'swap', and is rand basically now the Creator or something

I've only just finished and I'm still sorting through it so I've missed out a few things that hit me at the time that I thought were unresolved.

Did anyone else feel the same way?

Need a new Fantasy/Sci-Fi series to jump into Hi all!

Just finished Iron Gold (the new trilogy that follows up the Red Rising trilogy).

I loved that Red Rising was a real page turner and although Iron Gold didn't have the same gripping feeling for me, I still loved it.

I need a new series to get into, something that will keep me up late at night and have me really engaging with the world and characters.

The types of series I like are: Demon Cycle, all of Brandon Sanderson, Kingkiller Chronicles, The Gentleman Bastards etc. So anything along those lines I will probably like.

I've tried Mark Lawrence Thorns series and finished it, however, I found I didn't enjoy it too much towards the end. The same goes for Lev Grossman's Magicians.

My step-dad keeps recommending Wheel of Time as well as Brent Weeks, but I've read WOT has a real lull in the middle and I'm worried the latter wouldn't keep me as interested as others have.

I'm willing to try anything though, so recommend away :)

Rereading WoT not holding up I've been rereading the WoT books &amp; I love them they're great up until Brandon sanderson takes over. First couple of times I read it I didn't mind that much and thought he did a good job (and still do, probably better than any other would have done other than Jordan himself).

Upon rereading the previous 11 books though how jordan wrote the characters really stuck with me &amp; the difference really struck me hard. Some characters don't really lose that much and some come out different but still good enough that I don't mind (a lot of the female characters, nynaeve, aviendha, egwene so on). Mat just gets completely butchered though. From being my favorite character to being so cringeworthy it just doesn't make sense.


I can't really put into words why because I don't understand completely what's so different about it myself. If i had to guess it's that Robert jordans WoT was very lighthearted while Brandon sandersons WoT aims for more depth, more internal character struggles which were there in the original but in a very different way. But the new WoT becomes a more serious world where they're stuck between still trying to be lighthearted and yet also be serious.
I think Mat suffers that transition the worst as he's the epitome of the lighthearted WoT.

I don't think I'm explaining it well but suffice to say I do wonder how it would've looked if Robert jordan would've gotten to finish his work..

If I'm to say something positive about Brandon sandersons rendition of the end, especially A memory of light is that he brought an epicness to the end which made the impact of what happened (the deaths and such) more emotional.

Question about podcasts. I recently listened to the Legendarium WoT podcasts, and had a great time both agreeing and disagreeing with their opinions and thoughts about the series. I particularly enjoyed watching Craig go from constant criticism of every minor detail (mostly unfounded nitpicks in my opinion) to genuinely being gripped by the world.

I also listened to the WoTchers podcast, and was let down by how little the actually discussed the books, since a good portion of their airtime they just spend discussing their own writing and their own experience with authorship, which is not what I went in for.

I've been told that the WoT spoilercast is better. I've listened to the first few and I want to continue, since they're going to be talking in depth, chapter by chapter and talking full spoilers which is what I really want. But there are problems.

There American way of trailing off at the end of every sentence is something I can forgive and will push through, but before I continue, I need to know.

**Will they ever start pronouncing Ishamael's name right?**

He's named after Ishmael, I get it. But there's an extra syllable in there and it's *killing me* listening to it.

Rant about "Pre determined magic"/ Suggestions request Ok, so I just sat through Shadow and Bone by  Leigh Bardugo and I hated it, mainly because of the main character.  The main problem I had was that the MC was born with this super-rare magic and that some people just have magic and others don't and while I understand that some people like a "chosen one" main character (Or any MC powers that they didn't earn) , I just cant stand them as it subtly  suggest that one can only succeed based on the circumstance of your birth rather than by defeating them though handwork or using out-thinking them through  trickery or figure-out a solution that hasn't been thought of in short I prefer the kind of characters that earn there victory rather than being "destined" to win . For me, I prefer a reason for why characters have the powers they do.

For example the Knights Radiant from Stormlight have there powers because they display an aspect that attracts a spren and that spren decides whether or not to give them there powers and even then to improve your powers you need to make oaths to be a better person and if they don't the spren will either leave or could actually be killed, tl;dr there is a reason you get your powers and you can get stronger and weaker though or lose them through your actions.

Another one is Mistborn although there are slight spoilers for Hero Of Ages so be warned , People are only allomancers  cause gods have god-metals and Preservation had a fancy plan to beat Ruin so we no why he gave people Allomancy but we do no where it comes from and why people have and more than that we know its only class based cuase Rashek did a Rashek. And we know the super rare Mistborn exist instead of only mistings cuase Rashek didn't stop Rasheking with Preservation's god-metal

So in short i'm going to make a list of MC I like and MCs I dislike and then if anyone has suggestions for books or characters that fit either list please leave them so I know what to read and what to avoid.

MCs I like

* Kaladin/Shallan/Dalinar from Stormlight
* Kellen from Spellslinger
* Vivenna from Warbreaker
* Darrow  from Red Rising
* Yarvi from Half a King
* Kvothe from Name of the Wind
* Eragon (the way he gets his powers not the book) from Eragon
* Gerald from The Witcher

MCs I dislike

* Alina Starkov (Esspecially) from Shadow and Bone
* Rand al'Thor (I'm sorry but I just couldn't read past the first book) from Wheel of Time
* Luke Skywalker &amp; Rei (I liked the Movies but mainly because of other characters) from Star wars
* Gavin Guile from Lightbringer (Yes I know his secret but being born a drought-er is the point i'm trying to make Prisms are just more annoying)
* Most of YA

I know that some of the books light Lightbringer and WOT are good but I personally don't enjoy them and if you have any suggestions please leave them

Obligatory first reread post So I'm rereading the books for the first time after almost a decade, and I'm almost done with EotW in less than a week. Not only did I forget how amazing this series is even from book one, but the foreshadowing is real. I'm so excited to read the entire series again, and I now agree with the r/WoT community about how important it is to read it a second time.

No specifics, just wanted to share my excitement. If you've only read the series once, you'll want to reread it eventually. It's worth it.

Reading To Your Baby Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am due my first little one in December and am very keen to get reading to him/her ASAP. However, having seen most of the children's books available (which I do know are beneficial and I will be using them), does anyone here read their current fantasy book to their newborn? Currently on a WoT re-read and would really enjoy reading it aloud!

Also, are there any studies showing this is beneficial/detrimental? I read today that the more words children hear in early development, the more able/literate they are in later life.

Failing that, can anyone recommend any good children's books for 0-3,3-6... months?

(Spoilers All) I have finally finished the series I just finished aMoL and I have some thoughts.

Ogier version:

A little background on me and where WoT fits into my life.

I am a long time reader of WoT, and have returned to the series after a self-imposed ban of 12 years. My sister introduced me to the series in April of 2000, right after our dad died. I was 19 years old. These books allowed me to escape into this huge and beautiful world, so they will always have a special place in my heart. Between 2001-02, I think I reread the series like 3 times, then again for CoT and again for KoD. Funny story: I’m really not a fan of starting unfinished series; Stephen King killed me with the Dark Tower. So between CoT and KoD, I asked my sister for a recommendation of a book series that was finished. So she told me about GRRM’s a Song of Ice and Fire that she assured me was a complete trilogy!! I still have not forgiven her for that. But I digress...

I had twins two months before Robert Jordan died (I know he’s James Oliver Rigney, Jr. but he will always be RJ to me, sorry), and needless to say, I did not take his death well. I vowed to never read another unfinished series. I also did not take well to having twins, suffering from postpartum, then major depression for a few years. After that, I went back to college and got a degree which involved reading hundreds of pages of dense medical text, so reading was out for at least a year after I graduated. WoT had faded to the deepest parts of my memory. Now that I think back on what made me want to finally finish the series, the trigger is obvious. My mom had an unexpected quadruple bypass in February of this year. My subconscious knew what I needed. My first reread of the books after they were complete, and my first time reading any of the Sanderson stuff. I actually tried summaries by chapter because I was really and finally ready to get to the finale of this big piece of my life, but that ultimately stopped working around CoS--I got kind of confused with the plotline but also really nervous that I was getting to the end too quickly--so I went back to the very beginning and started to reread the series in earnest. I am so glad that I did. Man, the FEELS! The nostalgia! Combined with my whole new grown up perspective--the twins are nearly 11 now--I have just undergone an amazing journey. I purposefully avoided this subreddit to avoid spoilers. I have had no one to talk to about these wonderful books, so forgive me for being verbose. I also tried to avoid thinking about the Sanderson books being different, or not canon or whatever. Once I finally got to them, it didn’t bother me nearly as much as I think it could have if I had dwelled on it, and I actually loved them quite a bit and might start reading Mistborn next.

I have a lot of thoughts about events and characters in this series that have been rattling around in my head for a long time. I really think I just need to get them out of my head! Ok, here we go!

A character that everyone loves to talk about: Egwene. I liked her a lot more when I was younger. She is strong and independent. And even though she is cocky as hell, she really deserves to be because she is badass. But what I noticed this time that I absolutely hated was the fact that she was so judgemental of others but had no problem bending or breaking rules herself. I also didn’t like how she treated Nynaeve.

Nynaeve I liked a lot more this time, probably because I’m old and grouchy now myself.

Perrin I liked less, but that whole power wrought hammer scene was awesome. I liked Faile more even though I still hated her at first this time. That passive aggressive bullshit with The Ways. Ugh! But she got better.

Something that bothered me this time that didn’t before, maybe because I have twin boys that are rapidly turning into little men: Tylin’s treatment of Mat. But even worse was the whole Malkieri carniera deal. That was super creepy to me then and now.

Seanchan have Texas accents! I never realized until this read through. I came to the conclusion after having a random thought about how Seanchan talk slowly probably for the same reason people in the United States talk differently from people across the pond. I always heard them with a French accent for some reason before, but no, they’re cowboys! Hahaha! I tried to correct it in my head, but they just sounded so freakin silly! I am from Texas, so I mean no offense, I sound like a hick too. I also wished at one point that Tuon would channel on accident and change the whole Seanchan empire to something more conducive to peace and maybe even free their freakin slaves. Now I’m not so sure that would happen. I think she just might turn herself into a damane. But of course then Mat would have to rescue her somehow and change the Seanchan empire on accident.

Rand al’Thor. I never really connected with him very much on my last rereads, but this time, man he got me. Because of my sons, I felt this maternal love for this poor sweet boy. His story really is tragic. He was so hard on himself and it just made me so very sad. One of the few times I cried was when he talked to Nynaeve near the end. I’m tearing up just thinking about it. He terrified me when he took Colavere’s crown though. That was some true insanity and power he showed right there.

I think they should give Elaida’s palace to the Kin. Let them use it for their home base and send them out among the world in a rotation similar to what they were using in Ebou Dar. Elayne was being selfish with them. I didn’t like how she acted with Perrin and Faile about the Two Rivers, or how she was with the dragons. Greedy. I admired her determination though.

The out of nowhere crazy Sharans!!! Am I the only one who was completely blindsided by this? I mean I saw all the signs that they would eventually come into play but then they never showed up and I got swept up into the Last Battle. When that giant gateway opened up, all I could hear was hair metal playing. Some Welcome to the Jungle or something haha

Birgitte: Why exactly was she being born out into the world again?!? Because I thought that they were born back into the world when there was a great need. Maybe this has something to do with the big secret that nobody has asked Brandon Sanderson about. If the Seanchan do make a deal to release damane that want to leave, that means Moghedien could be loose again, giving Birgitte the chance to defeat her once and for all. Man that thread made me want to read aMoL again! I actually think I may because I flew through that sucker. It was so fast paced and amazing, and what’s the word...

The scene at the end where Rand lit his pipe without channeling was very strange. I don’t understand it. When I realized he couldn't channel my first thought was that he was going to die too soon for his channeling wives. Then he did that crap with his pipe and I was like is this even real what is going on why? Now I’m thinking maybe it has something to do with his single dragon fang saa. Maybe it's like a well or something? Or then again maybe he was somehow aided by his bond with Elayne or Aviendha. Something like what happened with Androl and Pevara? Gahhh! I don’t know, I’m totally thrown by that one.

Something that I found disappointing: I didn’t realize that there were still things to be spoiled after reading all 15 books. I was always curious about Setalle Anan and dreamed of a scene where she was finally healed, but it never happened so I looked her up. Turns out there are spoilers in the WoT Companion which I haven’t acquired yet. Needless to say I was disappointed...

Another thing that caught me off guard: there are WoT memes now!! I found r/wetlanderhumor the other day and about died! I feel like I’ve been living under a rock for the last ten years. The most advanced I ever got was when I was active on a yahoo message board around 2005-06. We didn’t even have pictures!

I also recently bought a one piece pantsuit thing (romper?) and can't help but to think of it as a dress with narrow skirts divided for riding.

Hasty human version:

I am a long time fan who was traumatized by RJ’s death and didn’t read the last three books until earlier this year. I just completed my first reread after not looking at or thinking of WoT for 12 years.

Egwene. It’s a love/hate relationship. Nynaeve I like more this time, Faile too but Perrin a little less. Mat is Mat. I was disturbed by his and Tylin’s relationship.

I love Rand.

Seanchan have a Texas accent. I never saw this before. I also didn’t realize Tuon was black until the last time I reread the books. I wish Tuon would have accidentally channeled. But kinda don’t.

I was blindsided by the Sharans.

I think Birgitte is being reborn to eventually fight Moghedien.

Rand and his pipe: Hmmm who was smoking crack that day.

There are WoT memes now!

28/M/Happily married but lacking friends to chat with about what I enjoy!!! Hi all;

I got married in May, and my mate and I share different interests. This results in me not being able to talk to her about the things I'm passionate about without explaining a lot of shit (she isn't even in the same ballpark). Basically I'm looking for someone to chat with about stuff that would fly over her head, and keep myself engaged and entertained! Also, I like to hear about other people's lives, whether than helps me vicariously live, or solving problems!!

I love board/pen and paper games. I play DnD with a group every other weekend (running a cleric lv7 and ranger lv6), Settlers of Catan, Carcassone, Munchkin, etc.

Video Games: actively looking for someone to WoW with going into new expansion(and similar games like FFXIV, Ni no Kuni II,) grand strategy (HoI IV, CK2, Civ series, Gal Civ III, Endless Legend, etc.), atmospheric (Amnesia series, Sunless Sea) , Colony builder (minecraft, banished, Tropico series, Prison Architect, gnomoria, FTL, Stardew Valley, Oxygen not Included, This War of Mine), RPG (Skyrim, Fallout series, GTA V, Dark Souls (demons souls and up!!!)) I enjoy playing with people and talking to them.

Books: Wot, GoT (a long ass time ago), LoTR, Battlefield Earth, Dune series, cthulu, iain m banks, the black company, gardens of malazan, oscar wilde, thoreau, fight club (and other books on philosophy (lol)), harry potter, Andrea Gibson poetry (fucking kills me everytime). I am at any given point reading 5-10 books.

Shows: Warehouse 13, The Lost Room, X Files, Fraiser, A Series of Unfortunate events, The Office, Parks and Rec, HIMYM, OITNB, Bob's Burgers, and more that I can't remember immediately.

Movies: I fucking love B reel movies that aren't in theaters. Love them. I never make time to watch them now though. Studio Ghibli, No country for old men, a quiet place, dinner for schmucks, Star Wars (even the new ones (come at me)),

Sports: Soccer; everything else is a snooze to me. Either I don't get it, or don't care to. Also, I think cricket is a made up sport to make fun of the rest of the non-british world, and that Australians take it WAY too seriously and do things like beat England at the Ashes. I think the rules are made up as the game goes along (and everyone involved is in on the joke) and outsiders can only be bewildered.

Music: I don't know where to even start, I have the most eclectic taste....bon Iver, Jason Molina, CCR, City &amp; Colour, Iron &amp; Wine (I have an Iron &amp; Wine tattoo), basically anything blues, Dry the River, Ben Howard, Bombay Bicycle Club, Daughter, Beirut, Matt &amp; Kim, Lucy Rose; fuck there's a lot more. But I am less exposed to new music now and would love to receive/share music with someone.

I am a big ol' DIYer and love carpentry and mechanicing (wrenching!). I enjoy the idea of tiny homes, but I don't think I could do it myself. I have a home and three acres of land, so I spend a lot of time taking care of it; mowing, weedeating, I have a small garden of tomatoes. I have both a dog (whippet) and a cat (tuxedo) that I adore immensely and would love pictures of your floofers. If you don't sing silly songs to your animals, you're either lying or a cyborg!

I speak French and have a degree in Anthropology (of course I use neither).

US; CT zone.

TLDR; need people I don't have to explain everything that I say to.

I'm done. I finished A Memory of Light. Gather. I have Thoughts. And Spoilers. So I finished it today. Some of you may have seen me posting every once in a while as I finished books in the series that I really liked and posted about them here.

This is probably gonna be a sort of long, rambling post, so if you don't want to read all of it, that's fine. But your should stay. Or don't whatever. I'd still like if you comment whatever you want. Whatever you want to say - favorite quotes, characters, questions, life advice for how to get out of bed tomorrow.

 I believe it took me 62 days, so fuck that guy who said he doubted I could finish the series before summer ended back when I posted a picture of me starting The Eye of the World. BTW, I still have no idea what the eye of the world actually really was in the first book.

Anyway, I've been reading this book series everyday for the last two months, and in many ways I've been more part of that world than I have this one. I guess you realize you've reached that point when the swears you reach for become "Light!" or "Burn that bloody wool-headed sheepherder." Basically what I'm trying to say is that its over and I guess it hasn't really hit me yet that there's no more ta'veren, no more Aes Sedai, no more assholish seanchan. So that kind of sucks but I guess I'm not as torn up as I thought I would be. I think that's because the journey was so long that unlike many stories, I got everything I wanted out of it by the end. That being said, if somebody could explain what the heck happened with Rand/Moridin at the end, that would be nice.

I don't want to start a fight about the whole Brandon Sanderson thing, but I just want to point out how I felt about it. I think that overall he did a really good job - it seems like the best outcome we could have had without Robert Jordan. That being said, part of me still wants to know what it would have been like had he written it. But you know, the wheel weaves as the wheel wills and all that. I thought A Memory of Light has some weak points and some pacing issues, but I'm satisfied overall with it and the closure it gave me.

Also how the hell did Lan come back to life? Or did he just not actually die?

Favorite male characters: Lews Therin, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Logain, Lan, Androl, Thom, Moridin there's kind of a lot honestly
Favorite females: Moraine, Nynaeve, Avienda, Siuan,  Birgitte, Graendal, Lanfear.

I think my favorite moment in the series was Rand's return to Dragonmount. I still miss Lews Therin.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that for weeks I've spent half of my waking hours reading, the other half thinking about the series, and at least half of my sleeping hours dreaming about. Like I shit you not even when my dreams weren't directly related to WoT, there was always some connection. I literally had a dream where I had a computer science research fellowship with Demandred. I didn't even know anything about Demandred then. So. Yeah.

Small things. Part of me wishes Logain's "glory" was cooler, but it was also a good redemption arc so I guess I'm satisfied. Was Be'lal a bitch or what. The Sea Folk literally do nothing other than be a pain in everyone's collective ass and so even though they're a cool culture, they can one hundred percent be removed if any fat needs to be trimmed for the show. I also think Androl and Pevara's relationship was one of the best and most unexpected parts of the series. Same for Morgase and Tallanovor surprisingly (as in I am surprised) I feel like some of the deaths like Siuan's were too... idk. There was something missing. Not an emotional investment per say but like the actual deaths weren't given time to register I feel.

Yeah this is too long and I need to go to bed and literally nobody's gonna read this so goodbye, I'll lurk on this subreddit as long as the wheel turns.

tl;dr - Unlike the wind, this post touched nobody cause it was too bloody long and unlike the wind, it was an ending.

A realization of truth from WoT Many may read the series with an outlook of enjoyment, seeking to be captivated in a fantasy world of another individuals creation. The writing is so immersive that it engages all senses, all the right observations being made at every moment in time. The perspective is focused on the details that bring life to the characters, life to the environment, life to the magic. It is beautiful in the way that it embraces all perspectives and observes from all minds, it is written in such a way that it opens up our own awareness as we read it.

It fills our minds with visualizations and thought forms that create light in our being.

Some may need to stay focused in order to soak in the majesty of this creation, as it is easy to drift within ones own mind and not perceive the nature of how pure and truthful this series is. It brings to light other possibilities within ones mind, opens the gate to imagination, it (if one allows it to) teaches the observer how to be, how to work the faculties of mind in order to create. It is so wonderful that I will not let this series go until I have read every last book. (6/14 here)

So here, the truth behind WoT. We here have a bible that contains the secrets to the universe, better yet we have FOURTEEN!

Peace and Love to you all ~ D

When should I reread WoT? So I finished the series about two years ago and it took me about 2-3 years to read, currently reading The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski, short easy reads compared to WoT.

What are people’s opinions on the reread, is it worth it, will it take me another two years lol?

And yeah first post here, hi all!

Time in a WoT (SPOILERS - ALL) So Im on my second round through the series, audo books only both times, so I appologize for horrible spellings, ive never seen it spelled out.

How long has passed from the first book to the begining of AMoL?  I think the answer is less than 2 years, but more than one....I only remember one winter, and the book specifically starts out aroudn beltine (spring equinox?).  To me it seems like much more time has passed than 2 years, i was imagining Rand spending at least 4-8 months on the east side of the spine of the world.... but that cant be right if its only 12-24 months total in the story.

Also more general, do "ages" last until a specifically monumental event takes place (Sealing the bore/breaking of the world) or is there some time allotment between the ages?  I seem to remember lots of talk about it being ~3000 years since the bore was sealed and the breaking started.

A tune which I feel can be an amazing intro music opener to the WOT TV series So, I know that a TV series is being developed for WOT. Currently I am on book 9, and its been really enjoyable so far.

Back to the point, there is a tune stuck in my head, which I feel would be the perfect intro music for the series (like any series has, for eg. the instantly recognisable GOT theme).

That tune is The Whole Universe Wants To Be Touched by Nils Frahm. Minimal, not so grand and showy like the GOT one, but amazing enough for it to be an intro music opener.

I am sharing the link in the comments, check it out and recommend the ones you feel would be an opener too. If you guys like what I recommended, maybe someone here with the connect suggest it to the TV guys ;) ?

What is it with Grimdark? This post might receive downvotes, but I would like to understand.

As a long-time member of this forum, I have noticed that the more vocal/frequent forum members seem to gravitate toward dark/grimdark fantasy. I have also observed a level of disdain against lighter fare, such as YA, heroic, and urban fantasy. In fact, I have seen DEAL posts for a FREE YA Fantasy book go from 30-some upvotes down to the teens. Why would someone downvote a FREE fantasy book? Isn’t a downvote supposed to be for *LACK OF RELEVENCE TO THE SUBREDDIT?*

Okay. On to my questions.

1: What is it about dark/grimdark fantasy that you find so attractive? (Yes, I’ve read my share, but between GRRM killing off every character I grow to like and the harsher grimdark making me depressed by torpedoing my faith in mankind, I now shy away from it.)

2: Do you exclusively read dark/grimdark or do you read other subgenres?

2a: If you read other subgenres, do you enjoy them as much?

2b: Do you mix in hopeful fantasy to give yourself some balance?

Lastly, I will note that while I technically write YA fantasy, I dislike much of the genre (It’s too widely defined.) The niche I write is the niche I enjoy reading: Coming of age/epic fantasy similar to The Belgariad, Codex Alera, and Feist’s Riftwar and Serpentwar books. My favorite series is WoT, which also qualifies as YA (young protags and clean content), despite the massive scope.

Deaths in WoT [Spoilers All] There is something about all the deaths that occur in the Last Battle that has never sat right with me. A lot of people die, but I don’t really feel the impact of it. In a weird way, it almost all feels sort of out of place and not in fitting with the story.

I think it’s because not enough characters die throughout the series, and then their plot lines get sort of cut short abruptly and what feels like somewhat pointlessly at the end.

How much more impactful would it have felt for Siuan to die in the White Tower, executed by Elaida when the Tower breaks, rather than having her escape only to live a somewhat pointless existence until her anticlimactic death at the Last Battle?

Same goes for Morgase... why survive Rahvin, only to have chapter upon chapter of boring POVs from her only to amount to nothing interesting in the end?

It felt like the characters were kept alive when they could have died impactful deaths, only to have them die non-impactful deaths later on. If they were to be kept alive through all that, I think I’d have preferred they also survived the Last Battle and had their threads wrapped up more satisfactorily. Thoughts?

After 7 books, I gave up on The Wheel of Time. Just couldn't do it anymore Well guys, I tried my best, but I think halfway through book 7, A Crown of Swords, I've realized that I just don't want to continue with the series anymore. It's weird because I don't even think it's particularly bad. In fact, I enjoyed most of the books quite a bit. The problem is that by and large, I'm finding most of the books...just pretty decent. They're not blowing me away or anything but are rather solid, mostly enjoyable books. However, just in my perspective, I don't think I can really justify spending the time and energy reading 14 books in a series I'm just intermittently enjoying.

I'm also having a lot of issues with the narrative, which at this point in the series has really slowed down quite a bit and seems to lack a sense of urgency or major stakes. I also really, really do not like most of the female characters as well as the whole male/female dynamic. It's really kind of trite and juvenile. The women characters are just awful, especially egwene and elayne. They're bad enough to make me want to stop reading sometimes.

I still enjoy the world building and a lot of the character development but the other factors have just kind of made me want to drop it. I hear the series gets better starting from book 11 onwards but I dont know if I can make myself complete the series.

Anyone else give up WoT or another epic series?

Just finished the series! (Major spoilers inside). Favorite part for you? For me, I think it is the beginning of book 4. Whichever book introduces Karsa. The entire section where he is still living with the Teblor just had an amazing mood and atmospheric appeal. I wanted to read a book just about the Teblor due to how amazing that section was. That was some of the best fantasy writing I've ever read.

I have to say, I think books 2-...idk maybe 6 are the best? I feel like the last two are too rushed and had some loose ends. I also felt like the philosophical pontificating was a bit much near the end. I understand that walking through the glass desert is awful, but we have some other plot points to attend to IF YOU PLEASE.

I assumed that Karsa was going to play a larger role, along with the crimson guard. Apsalara and Crokus just sorta got cast off, along with Mallick Rel and the Empress, etc.

Which side series do you recommend most? Already read all the Korbal and Broach, which I thought were decent but not great.

I'm also thinking about picking up some Sanderson stuff (I've only read what he did for WoT).

Help rekindle my love for books Hi all,

I've mostly lurked in this reddit for some time, but I want to draw upon the reddits vast knowledge of fantasy worlds yet to be discovered (by me) to help me get back into reading fantasy books again.

I've read a bit when I was younger but the habit never really took a hold and it wasnt really cultivated by parents either. Gaming took it's place and honestly, that's been my major hobby for 25 years. A year ago, I started listening to audiobooks in my commute to work time, and it after I listened to last words of Jonathan Renshaw - Dawn of Wonder, I was absolutely hooked.

Since then I've been reading the Wheel of Time series (I'm not exactly the fastest reader) and perhaps this wasnt exactly the right choice for a novice fantasy reader.. but I'm at book 8 and getting totally burned out on all the tedious plot twists and character tropes (like all women being akin to the root of all evil). It's gotten to the point I just can't pick up the book again, even though I've honestly found that rush of adventure to be amazing and something I need in my life.

Then I peruse this reddit and look at the thousands upon thousands books, reviews, discussions and truth be told, I'm a bit intimidated and feel "choice-paralysed". I've seen people say in this forum, well, I just figure, I'm in this or that mood and then take a book that matches that. That's probably how I'd like to start out as well, but I have no idea how to properly gauge a book to be a good read and whether it fits the mood. And the idea that I pick up a second WoT where I want to stop halfway is pretty disheartening.

This post is not so much of a 'recommend me a book' (although, feel free to recommend light hearted adventurous books like Dawn of Wonder), but ideally, when you have a friend that wants to get into reading fantasy, what do you tell them? Do you have a few recommended websites that can help a new reader, or a starter list of books that will likely get 90&amp;#37; of the readers hooked?

Thanks in advance!

(Spoilers Book 1-3) Starting TSR after a long break Sorry for the awful title, bear with me here.

As the title kinda explains out, I'm starting back into my read of WoT and looking for some info. I have no idea how it has happened but twice in my life I've been interrupted by life events that have caused me to stop reading in the middle of TSR. I've read books 1-3 twice and somehow both times I've had to stop reading as soon as Rand and company arrive at Rhuidean. Last night I started getting back into TSR and burnt through the first 13 chapters.

Anyway, the main reason I wanted to start this thread is to ask for some basic help. It's been about a year since I took my break and I feel like I'm gonna be forgetting some details on the previous 3 books.  Is there any small amount of details I could be forgetting? Do you guys recommend going through the WoT encyclopaedia to get a full reminder of the first 3 books? Any advice for some of you guys that might have taken breaks between books and what you did to remember things?

Thanks again for all the help! Can't wait to get into the series again.

Best completed Fantasy series? The only real fantasy I've read so far is the Six of Crows duology and Elantris. While they were both pretty good, neither one really blew me away. I'm aware of the longer completed series such as WoT and Malazan, but was looking for something a little shorter before delving into these. I was thinking about picking up the Mistborn trilogy, but any other recommendations would be appreciated.

Suggestions for a good fantasy book Hello guys!!! I wanted to see if anyone could give me good recommendations on books. I’m looking for a book series that has 3+ books (preferably that is completed but I’m down to read ongoing series), I want both big battles and some bad ass 1v1 fights. I have read the game of throne series and I finished WoT about two months ago. I have been forcing myself to read Malazan Book of the Fallen and I dont know if the book has a slow start but I’m not being Darwin in as I hope it would draw me in so I’m a little sad about that. Long story short I’m looking for series that can meet some of these requirements:

-great battles
-good magic system
-somewhat easy to read
-main character(s) is/are not a ridiculously moral character (the closer to an anti-hero the better)


Like I said I’m a little bummed at how slow the start of MBotF has been so far. But if it picks up the pace soon I would consider reading the whole thing.

Thank you for your time

Defending the Middle Books Hello all! I am currently on FoH, so I'm not quite in that books 7/8 - 10 stretch everyone talks about dipping in quality, and as I've heard this stretch of books even extended in both directions to books 6 and 11, I'd like to give people the chance to defend any or all of these "middle books," especially if one or two of them happen to be anyone's favorites. (Also this serves the purpose of keeping me motivated! Which shouldn't be necessary as I love WoT so far, but still.) No spoilers please!

Just finished The Broken Empire, now what? So I recently finished this trilogy. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I did feel the last book was slow but maybe I was just burning myself out with how fast I read the first two. I loved the darkness of the MC and his band of misfits. It's time for something knew though and I'm open to suggestions.

Other works I've read. Asoiaf - lotr - many of the drizzts book - hunger games - WoT up to like book 7 - dean koontz Frankenstein - Clive clussler Dirk Pitt novels - a lot of John Jake's work.

Honestly I'm just looking for a something with charactera you fall in love with and/or hate. Something that makes you want to keep reading that next page. It can be extremely dark or something easy going as long as it grabs your attention.

Sorry for the trash grammar/punctuation.

Character Defence: Egwene al'Vere I'm going to preface this post by saying that Egwene is my all time favorite character in the Wheel of Time series. She wasn't always, but after she became Amyrlin Seat she really grew on me.

Two more notes before I begin: I've never read the books, only listened, so forgive any egregious spelling errors, I'll do my best. And, as this is a defence of her character as a whole, expect spoilers from the entire series.


Every character in WoT has an incredible amount of characterization and effort put into them. Even characters that are viewed wholly as unimportant and distasteful have so much care put into the way they fit into the story.

Egwene al'Vere, in my opinion, has the most impressive and realistic character arc in the series. She goes from a small village girl who only dreams of seeing the world to a novice in the White Tower, to the most powerful woman in the world. And aside from that, she's one of the most important people in the series.

It becomes obvious very early on in EoTW that Egwene wouldn't be completely satisfied with a life in the Two Rivers. If she'd stayed she would have been happy, married Rand and had a daughter, possibly more kids, and died as a farmer's wife. Eventually Rand would have touched saidin and went mad from the taint, with no one able to teach him to control himself.

Moiraine shows up and throws little Emond's Field into chaos: Trollocs follow her and massacre the village, and she steals away in the night with Rand, Mat, Perrin and Egwene. Of the three, only Egwene said, "I want to go, I want to leave and see the world." The boys left because they were assured that it would help protect their families, but Egwene left because she wanted more from her life.

This says a lot to her character. Some people might see it as her being eager to run away and forget everything she knows; I've seen that argument. I prefer to think it means that she needs to see the world before it passes her by. No one would question someone in real life for wanting to travel, and many people want to leave behind lives that they don't think are a fit for them.

After leaving the Two Rivers and being separated from Moiraine and the others at Shadar Logoth, Egwene and Perrin are left together. Egwene's natural matriarchal and stubborn personality emerges, bullying Perrin into doing things even when he doesn't want to, such as riding Bela. This is an attribute that is present in every woman from the Two Rivers and should not be used against Egwene. Coming from a matriarchal society, it only makes sense that she expects to get her way.

Eventually Egwene gets to the WT and becomes a novice. She, Nynaeve, Min and Elayne are betrayed by someone they should have been able to trust, a figure of authority in the form of an Aes Sedai. Egwene is captured and tortured by the Seanchan, and her spirit is almost broken until she thinks she is nothing but an animal.

After she is rescued she is understandably wary of trusting anybody, especially Red Sisters. She lashes out against White Cloaks because she fears that they mean to imprison her because if what she is, exactly what happened in Falme. She is chastised, and rightly, by Verin Aes Sedai for her actions.

Once she is made accepted she gains more responsibility and begins to learn more about her particular abilities i.e. dreaming and dream walking. This is one of the most important aspects of Egwene's character: she brings back that which is lost. She is essentially a tool of the Wheel that allows old Talents and powers to be reborn.

She, Elayne and Nynaeve to the Tear and are captured by Black Sisters, again being betrayed by someone they believed they could trust, this time a thief taker, Juilin Sandar. They are later rescued by Mat, but because of who they are and what they are told they are(the most powerful channelers in thousands of years), they berate Mat and act as if they were about to escape on their own.

Egwene then accepts the tutelage of the Wise Ones in the Waste, accepting their authority on her ability to dream walk. She promises not to enter Ten'Aran'rihod without one of them present. She breaks this promise repeatedly, which is morally reprehensible, although understandable. It is, in fact, part of becoming a WO: learning when to do what you think necessary.

This is very similar to her situation in the WT. As a novice, one is expected to follow the rules blindly, learning only later the reasons behind them. A cepted are given leniency and aren't punished as often for infractions because they should know by that point which rules can be broken. It isn't openly stated in either the WT or the WO, but growing to do your own thing is an important step.

After she leaves the WO to go to Salidar and is made Amyrlin, Egwene is essentially made into a puppet for the Hall of the Tower. She was raised because older, more experienced women believed that they could manipulate her. Remember, Aes Sedai created the great game. One cannot hold Egwene accountable for being scheming and manipulative when she was forced into a position she didn't want, surrounded by some of the best schemers and manipulators in the world.

She uses her predecessor, Siuan, as an advisor and confidant, Siuan being the only person with whom Egwene shares anything in common with anymore. Nynaeve and Egwene came from the same village and are both Aes Sedai, but Siuan understands the pressure of the Amyrlin Seat, and she knows the pitfalls that led to her demise. With proper guidance, such as received from Siuan, Egwene had the ability to become an incredible and accomplished Amyrlin.

The milestone of becoming Amyrlin Seat allows a small respite for me to address one detail that I have seen crop up in many posts that slander Egwene's character: how she treats other characters, especially those from Emond's Field, and Nynaeve in particular.

As stated above, Egwene and Nynaeve come from a primarily matriarchal society. Women have the most powerful in the TR, even if it doesn't seem like it. Nynaeve was the Wisdom in Emond's Field, which technically made her equal to the mayor in importance. Her duties were to lead the Women's Circle, help the Village Council not to be wool brains and heal anyone she could heal. One thing we know that Wisdom's did was to give someone a foul tasting concoction to get them out of dour moods or to stop lying.

Egwene, in TAR, while she was still an apprentice WO, attempted to give such a concoction to Nynaeve after Nynaeve lied to her about something or other(I'm listening through them again, I'll get to that part eventually. If someone can help me with this I'd appreciate it.). Yes, Egwene lied about being allowed in TAR, but again, it was all part of becoming a WO.

With every other character from Emond's Field, Egwene grew up being able to twist Rand and Perrin around her fingers, and Mat being Mat. It only makes sense that she'd continue treating Mat like a scoundrel and Rand and Perrin like she does until close to the end of the series: it's how she always saw them, and she's still just 19 or 20, not long enough for her opinions of them to change much.

Her opinion of Mat, however, does get a boost when he's in Salidar to 'rescue' Elayne. He sees her walking around, trying to look Aes Sedai, while the Hall of the Tower follows behind her, not allowing her to be part of their conversations, not even letting her look like the Amyrlin, a position they literally forced on her. Mat goes up to her, makes a leg, calls her "Mother" proper as you please, and kisses her ring. Everyone else has no choice but to bow and curtsy without denying her position.

Egwene, who has yet to thank Mat for rescuing her from the Stone of Tear, thanks him, quietly. That alone is a clue to how deeply her character has changed up until this point.

Almost immediately after becoming Amyrlin Seat, Egwene is given the bracelet that connects her to Mogedean. This again points to Egwene bringing back that which is lost. Nearly everything that she teaches the other Aes Sedai is stolen from Mogedean. Two very important exceptions are: Cueandillar and Travelling. On her own, with nothing but the phrase, "make a similarity in the pattern" Egwene manages to create a Gateway halfway across the world. She had no way of knowing it would work or if she was about to still herself, but she rediscovered Travelling. Similarly, Mogedean gave her some knowledge of Cueandillar, but she figures out how to make it all work. Mogedean couldn't create Cueandillar herself.

Egwene was captured by the WT, taken prisoner, her greatest fear, within her home. There she began to make uneasy alliances and eventually build up trust in a tower that had been shaken to its foundation, renewing ties that had been severed by a woman who was so bent on power that she couldn't see the mess she had made.

This is when Egwene shows her true character, and I feel far too many people overlook this when they judge her. She is willing to step aside as Amyrlin Seat. It is not something she can do, or has the chance to do, but it is something that she is willing to do. She tells Elaida that she would love to step down and give her the Tower, if only Elaida was capable. Again, this is a huge part of who Egwene is: she cares more about the WT than about keeping a title and chair.

During the Seanchan invasion Egwene rallies the novices and accepted into circles and begins a defence. She explicitly stated to them, "you're mine," refusing to let anyone be taken away. She is unable to keep every Sister from being taken, but she does everything she can be expected to do, even going so far as to blast raken from the sky if they are carrying Sisters because death is a far better alternative to being damane.

After the Tower is reunited, Egwene goes against all logic and chooses a Red to be her Keeper. Not only is Sylviana a Red, she beat Egwene repeatedly, three to four times a day for more than a month. And Egwene chooses her to be her Keeper of the Chronicles. Choosing this woman shows that Egwene doesn't hold a grudge. In fact, it shows the level of care that she has for the Tower. The Hall thought she planned on having Sylviana executed, but she shamed every single one of them, lauding Sylviana as a paragon of what the WT should be

Finally, there comes the Last Battle. Egwene leads the forces of the WT against the forces of the Shadow. She repeatedly insists on going out to the front lines more often that is safe because she is the most powerful channeler they have, and she has more talent than most others with combat weaves. She discovers a weave to counter balefire and restore the Pattern. She battles bloody Mazerim Taim and sends him running. Egwene is, I believe, a level 6/7 in the Power. Taim is a level ++2. Even with her sa'angreal she shouldn't be able to chase him away so quickly, but she does. He comes back with the.secind most powerful sa'angreal ever made for men and is still unable to beat her. She uses her newfound weave to destroy Taim and every channeler aligned with the Shadow within range of her.

TL;DR Egwene grew up believing women should rule the world, got PTSD, got a fancy chair, blew herself up.



I'm not saying you're wrong for disliking Egwene, but you have to remember, as a reader, you can get inside every charater's head, not just your own. As a character, Egwene can only be inside her own head. She doesn't have the same omniscience you and I get when we read the books. Yes, she is annoying at the beginning of the series. Yes, she betrays confidences and lies. She makes mistakes. But so do you, so do I, and so does every other character in the Wheel of Time.

So, if you still hate Egwene, at least look at her as she is: a girl who got in over her head, was tortured for weeks on end and overcame her demons and rose to greatness.

At the least, I hope you'll give her another look.

Thanks

In a Rut. Help? I've read all the standard big series (WoT, all Sanderson, riyira, lightbringer, etc...). Just recently I finally went through LOTR for the first time, and was craving more middle-earth like worlds, so I've powered through nine  salvatore novels, but ak pretty burned out on them at this point and I realize I have zero inspiration for where to go next. Any thoughts would be appreciated

General question about the series Hi I just finished reading WOT and I'm looking to get into a new series but I'm trying to decide which.  I just have a general question about the series. Is there a central plot point in the series things are heading towards (like WOT or lotr) or is it just various arcs or stories within the same universe (like a dark discworld)? I've been trying to work it out from wiki but I can't really tell.

Newbie introduction post! Hazzah! The first 6 books have arrived. I can finally get stuck in. Thanks for the questions and suggestions people gave. I haven't started reading yet so this will be an introductory post.

So a bit about me. I'm matt or Miggins as my nickname is. Im 18 and from slough in the uk. No one will know where that is so lets just say its the place where the office (bbc original version) is set.

So i love reading.  Have done ever since i was a kid. I used to read a lot but then life and exams got in the way. In the past year I've read a tonne more. I have 3 specific genres i love, which are horror, crime, and adventure/archeological mystery indiana jones kinda thing.  I normally read a book from each genre one after the other to keep me engaged.

My experiences with fantasy? I've read lord of the rings,am a huggge fan. I'm going to fanboy out over New Zealand hobbitt things when im out there this year! As a kid i used to read lots of fantastical novels with dragons and the like.  Other than that i don't have much experience with it. As a lot of people do i love the game of thrones tv show and recently i have finished the audiobook for book one of ASOIAF which has re-engaged my past love of fantasy.  I do love the high fantasy sort of genre so I'm excited because i know WOT is that sort of fantasy.

Now i must confess i have read some of WOT before.  I started it when i was 12 and got to the dragon reborn a year later.  But i gave up. It took me ages to read, i didn't understand half the world. I was quite simply too young to take it all in. And in the past year I've re- read some books i tried when i was about 12 that like WOT i didn't really get at the time but love now. This is partly what inspired me. The other part is hearing about the books from a friend and having been constantly recommended sanderson. I'd heard of him before and knew hed finished WOT but i never read any of his stuff. But so manu people have told me to read him and i was feeling a desire for fantasy. So i decided to start reading  a 14 novel series before i get to sanderson 😂😂. I may read some of them like elantris after a few WOT books to break it up a little and refresh myself.

So what are my expectations? Looking at the cover of EOTW i expect it to be a sort of high fantasy, quest, chosen one sort of fantasy. Now i can't remember anything from reading it before so as it stands i am going in pretty blind to what to expect.  The blurb and stuff suggests to me that it will be quite an extensive world building and mythology which i had heard about already. The thickness of the book leads me to expect this too,and a lot fo description. Sometimes this good and immerses you in the world. Sometimes its overkill so i hope its the former.  I am very excited to read it and see what its like. I get the impression from the cover and blurb that it will be a sterotypical LOTR style fantasy so we shall see if it subverts the conventions and my expectations.

The plan? Read a few chapters a week and post on reddit my thoughts and answer qs from people and people can discuss in the comments about the books and what they think about my thoughts. Anyway hope you guys liked this. As i said its just an introduction for now. I hope you enjoy a newbie's perspective and if im annoying anyone with my posts please say!

Anyway I'll hope to read about 5 chapters this week as im on holiday, but we'll see how i get along. Any comments or questions please comment below or pm me.

Cheers
Miggins

I want to pick up WoT again. How should I proceed? I read the first five books two years ago, so I have forgotten many plot points. However, I do remember critical junctures in the way the story proceeds such as

&gt;!Rand al'Thor being the Dragon Reborn!&lt;

&gt;!How he recovered that sword that doubled as an artifact enhancing his powers (I am sorry; I forgot its name)!&lt;

&gt;!Morraine's death!&lt;

&gt;!Rand's trial among the Ariel and how he's an Ariel by birth!&lt;

I am sure that as I read along; I will remember more of the plot. My plan right now is to have a glance at the wikia and then take the series up back again from where I have left it. Do you think this is feasible?

So is there anyone else *not* infatuated with Sanderson? I'd rather not hijack the other post from today, but it seems to me that the majority of people in r/fantasy (and in real-world fantasy fangroups) just love everything Sanderson puts out.

I'll admit that I haven't read a helluvalot by him. I did enjoy his books finishing up the Wheel of Time, but that appreciation is tempered by the fact that A) Robert Jordan's actual writing ability wasn't a tough act to follow, and B) I was well-and-good hooked into the world of WoT and was going to gods-damned finish.

I read Elantris, and was far less than enamored with it. The characters felt one-dimensional to me, and while the setting was solid (seeing a pattern here with RJ actually), I was disappointed at how formulaic everything seemed from a storytelling and character-development standpoint. It struck me as a writer (and many of us have done this) thinking up a pretty cool idea and then writing a story around said unique idea; the story itself falls by the wayside of communicating the creative nucleus.

After a few other books I decided to revisit him with The Way of Kings. Man, did I dislike this book. Not once could I be made to care about the main character (I can't even remember his name). I lost interest only 25% of the way through, and I can't really put a finger on it. I actually feel guilty since it's so widely-lauded, and I may have to revisit it soon.

I've had people tell me that he's just a "slow start," but I've braved the trenches of Malazan and Osten Ard, so I don't think that's it for me.

I understand he's a very nice guy and he's obviously prolific, and I wish him well. I just can't seem to get into his writing. Thoughts? Should I try to read Mistborn instead of going back to Stormlight?

Sammael (spoilers ALL) So I just finished WoT, absolutely loved it. I don't have any major gripes with the series but one thing that I thought was somewhat lame was the death of Sammael. I thought the final battle scene, specifically his death, was a little dissapointing. And especially given how their rivalry had built up over a couple books, for him to betray his more cautious behavior throughout their dealings only to just wander into the street and get balefired seemed odd. I was completely convinced after reading that that he hadn't actually been killed...

There was a point in a later book, I think just after Moridin had become nae'blis when he confronted all the foresaken at a meeting and said someone disguised as sammael was sending trollocs into the ways (I'm sorry but can't remember the specific passage and am too lazy atm to look back)... was this specific thing ever referenced again? I read through the entire rest of the series expecting sammael to come back somehow, even up until the last battle (lol) but I don't ever remember moridin or anyone else bringing this up again. Did I miss something?

I suppose that these were trollocs going to invade andor? But what would be the motivation of someone to disguise themself as sammael specifically?

WOT readthrough prologue introduction Prologue Thoughts.

Hey guys, i am writing from the amazing English Lake District. I finally started EOTW. Woo!

I got through the prologue initially as i have been doing my walking in the currently sunntly lake district, although this is probably going to change lol!

So just some initial thoughts.  Wow. Its quite an entrance for Jordan. He really likes to throw the reader into the deep end doesn't he! But saying that, you never feel angry or frustruated even though you are completely lost. Its more a sense of wonder and mystery.  The worldbuilding looks set to be phenomenal. Just the fact that he's come up with names for ancient books in his world and written quotes, and the names.

Clearly he has a plan from the prologue and there is a lot of foreshadowing in place which will obviously make sense later on( from what relatively little i know of Jordan, probably in about book 10!). It drew me in a lot and created a desire to learn about the world and what it all means. I was confused, but in a good way in a sense. I'm sure all the names will confuse me so i made a sort of glossary.

Anyway onto the main sort of thoughts section later.  I'll go in order of my thoughts i wrote when i read it.

Can we stop hating on Mr. Sanderson? He and Mr Jordan are not the same person. Why would their writing style be? Sure it's jarring and awkward in places, but that's because we're so used to a certain set-up.  I believe if Brandon had tried to emulate Robert word-for-word it would have been awful. Like uncanny valley. He was faced with the thankless task of finishing a mythos that was years/decades in the making. What if he'd passed up on the opportunity? who would we have gotten instead? would the series even have been completed?

People forget that he did the very best he could in a far from ideal situation, and I for one think he rescued the books in more ways than one. We all know the "middle books" are slow, and it picks up dramatically after CoT, and then ramps up admirably book on book, almost where he takes up the yoke. I hate to appear to be criticising the original author, but he wasn't perfect. His storytelling was great, but he messed up the pacing right there. Nobody is perfect. (albeit I for one enjoyed the drawn out politics and psychology, even if it was originally unintended). Imagine the snowdrifts of notes Brandon had to wade through whilst keeping publishers, editors AND fans happy. He was walking a tightrope the whole freaking time and did the very best he could. I think it paid off. Your favourite TV box set almost definitely has guest directors, and if you pay attention, you notice the different flavours from episode to episode.

Brandon's first publication was in 2005 at the age of 30 (thanks Wikipedia) while TEotW was published 15 years prior (1990) in an entirely different social era by somebody going on twice his age with several other publications under his belt. David carrying on Goliath's mantle.

I for one stand and applaud him for doing it, and doing it well. As himself, a fan of Robert's, an established but still green author, staying true to the theme but not pretending to be somebody he's not. I think we all should applaud him and drop the zealotry, whether blatant or veiled.

TL;DR: Give the guy a break.

Kudos, Mr. Sanderson. Immediately after WOT I started Mistborn and have been a fan of your works ever since.

Looking for a new Fantasy series that I haven’t read yet. I’ve read a lot of fantasy series lately, and am looking for something new.
I like stories with magic and/or magical creatures.
I do not like graphic violence, and do not want to read any more books containing rape scenes.

Here’s a list of series I’ve read already, if that helps.

- The Hobbit. Liked it.
- LOTR - Like a few parts, but dislike it overall.
- All of Tamora Pierce’s books - Loved them.
- Dragon riders of Pern - Liked it
- The Tearling Series - Liked the first two books, the third not so much.
- Harry Potter - I’m a fan
- The Alvin Maker series - Loved it on my first read, second was meh.
- The Green Rider Series - Liked it until it got too dark, with graphic torture scenes
- WOT: I’m glad I read or once, but I probably won’t again.
- His Dark Materials - Liked it.
- Wilde Island Chronicles- Great
- Wizard of Earth-Sea - Loved the world building, but not her writing style.
- The Patternist Series - Hated it. Far too dark.
- Kingkiller Chronicles - Liked most of it
- Eragon - Nope.
- The Percy Jackson Series - It was okay.
- The Magicians - Hated the books.
- Uprooted - Loved it.

If anyone could point me towards a fantasy series I haven’t read that doesn’t get *too* dark or violent, please let me know!

If not, would you recommend your fav sci-fi book that fits my likes?

Thanks!

Reading Sword of Truth after rereading WoT for the 3rd time I am on book 14 (unfortunately) of the SoT series and it has been a bit of a struggle. It wouldn't be such a bad series if I could get over how often he repeats everything like I am spending a month on every chapter and have to be reminded about every detail of every book all the time. I want to know your thoughts on the series if you read it. I am going to try and finish the series since I have come this far already. Though I will probably never reread the series.

Any Wheel of Time fans? So this is my favorite book series ever and I finished it last year. Recently decided to look into the Wheel of Time Role Playing game. Mind you, I've NEVER played D&amp;D or anything like that, never thought it was my thing but I might be willing to try it for the sake of getting to play in WoT world!

Any other fans of the series? Anyone care to do a meetup and play!? I'm willing to dive into learning how to play pretty heavily so I can run the game, but if anyone is an experienced roleplayer that would be a big help since I R NUB.

(Spoilers All) AMoL Questions and Some Opinions/Ramblings **I just finished the series and loved every minute of it but I have a few questions:**

1. Olver got to blow the Horn because Matt "died" at some point so the ownership of the horn was cleared. I think the book mentioned it was not when he was hung at Rhuidean but another time. Which event were they referencing?
2. Did the Tinkers get any closure on the song they long sought for the Way of The Leaf or did I miss something really big?
3. Egwene formed some sort of inverted weave that combated balefire. Do we know exactly what this is, or is it left unknown?
4. How did Rand light his pipe? Is this mean't to be ambigous?
5. Was there any significance to Alivia being the one who was to "help Rand die"?
6. What was the connection between Morridin and Rand? Morridin didn't want Rand dead through most of the series, so did he know of one of the possible endings the world might take?
7. Did Fain somehow fuse with Machin Shin from the Ways? What was Fain? It seemed very abrubt when he showed up and soon after died in AMoL.
8. Is Shitan the Creator? He reminded me of the main evil in Mistborn: Ruin, the deepness? Can't remember which.
9. Early on when Rand is with Selene and they use the (transportation stone?) Rand fights and kills a Grom. Where they in Seanchan/Teleranrhoid Seanchan?
10. Is there a podcast where readers discuss what they thought of the end/series? I plan to digest the story for a while before I start something new.

**Opinions/Ramblings**

* I just wanted to say Brandon Sanderson really did a great job finishing up this series. Some people argue some stuff was changed for the worse, but I can't think of another author which could have put so much love and care into finishing this beast. I think most of the ending was written by Robert Jordan, but man the ending and the series will really stick with me. Usually riding off into the sunset seems somewhat cliched, but it was really a moving moment. Rand has been through the ringer so to have the weight of existence on your shoulders to then having none was really nice seeing him kind of jesting to himself at the end. It seemed like he was really himself for the first time in a long time.

* I'm overall happy with Mat and Perrins endings. I'm glad Faile was still alive, but was also grateful she didn't get any speaking parts in the last chapters. I also thought it was pretty cool when Slayer had his head bashed in with Perrin's power forged hammer. Matt and Tuon get to keep playing their game and have a little one on the way which was cool. Having fireworks at the end was cheesy, but also wholesome. I wish I could have been a bug on the wall for the conversation between Tuon and Hawkwing assuming it actually happened.

* I think Egwene went out pretty great. If she had not died fighting M'hael, her ending would have pretty much been returning to the White Tower and ruling without Gawyn which would have been pretty weak. The other Aes Sedai goading Cadsuane to be the new Amyrlin was a fitting ending to her story I thought.

* Hurin was one of my favorite side characters and I almost teared up when he died. When I was going through the series I kept wondering where my favorite sniffer was! He showed up and I was giddy, but then Rand was a jerk. Then he showed up again and died... RIP Hurin. I think Rand apologized off screen and shortly before his death Hurin was still thinking of Rand. What a great guy!

* Nyneave was another one of my favorite characters. She is one of the purest of heart in the series and truly stays loyal to the Two Rivers troupe in every book. I don't think she ever wavered. Even when Rand starts to go a little nuts and casts out Cadsuane, she sticks with him and tries to help. I thought it was really sweet in the end where she tells Perrin something along the lines of, "I left the Two Rivers in the beginning to keep all of you safe". I think she deserves to know Rand is alive most of all. I like to think she will find out.

* I was fine with the tepid payoff of Logain's prophecy. I don't think all questions need to be answered and I like to think he rose to some sort of "Flame of the Black Tower" position. His last works that Ashaman always protect was really touching.

* I think I way overhyped Padan Faine in my head. He was such an interesting character. He is a peddler, with the White Cloaks, some sort of creature, changes accents without really knowing it. Then his story just ends. I would say his death was written pretty anticlimactically and seemed line an afterthought.

* I really enjoyed Androl and Pevaras relationship in the last book. I wish there could have been more of that sprinkled in the other books. I think they were a good indication of how the future age will develop.

* Faile's kidnapping could have been completely cut from the series and nothing would have changed (maybe helped forge alliance with Seanchan?). Also, I'm pretty sure the Sea Folk could have been cut as well. There wasn't really an interesting Sea Folk character my mind could latch to so I mostly forgot about them.

* Early in the series I was reading online to get some info on something WoT related and I just saw the phrase "Mat's Dragons" and looked away as fast as my eyes could make me. Until Aludra constructed the "Dragon cannons" later in the series, I thought Mat was going to actually get some Dragons. I'm glad I was wrong.

I'm officially rambling now, so I just want to thank this subreddit for providing me with discussion in the past as well as answering things I have been confused about while reading this story. This was the longest series I have ever read and really enjoyed it! I look forward to a reread one day.

After finishing Malazan, where do you go? Malazan occupies a unique place in my heart.  I have not read any of it yet but have 2x or 3xed WoT, GoT, Cosmere and many other terrific series.

I read a lot and have no doubt I will love this series, no doubt at all.  I love clues and confusing shit.

My worry is where I go after?  For years Malazan has been held as the pinnacle for dense complex story telling.

I would love to know if any of you were afraid of this plunge or if any of you feel lost in life after reading it?

Essentially, what can I expect in a post-Malazan world?

feelings on animals/environmental issues I was thinking about this a few days ago and the thought has occurred to me in the past as well. Many fantasy authors are dedicated to animal welfare or environmental causes. Sometimes their views are openly stated in author notes and others work it into their books. I couldn't even begin to name all of the animals in fantasy novels or series that play an important role. Guenyvar (sp?) and Drizzt, precious Bella in WoT, Stressa with Wren in Shannara, and so on. Some series, such as Redwall, are based entirely on animals. The Shadows of the Apt takes affinity to insects to an extreme. Robin Hobb created a very strong bond between humans and animals. The list goes on and on.

How many other fantasy readers are also passionate for causes related to animals and the environment or dedicated to their own animals or wildlife? My father is a lifelong fantasy reader as well. I inherited a love for the genre and a love of animals from him. He always brought home sick, injured, or stray animals and I've started my own rescue/sanctuary. We've always been very concerned with environmental issues and support related charities. Is this common among fans of the genre?

Who other than Brandon Sanderson would you have liked to finish the Wheel of Time? I am good with Brandon Sanderson having been chosen and I am really happy we got to see what RJ had planned for everyone up to the end of the series. He took on a difficult project where it would have been virtually impossible to fully please people and overall he did admirably. My only criticism is in how much his prose and literary style differs from Jordan’s. His choice of words often times I can only describe as ... goofy? Or simple? Compared to Jordan.

Who else would you have been okay with taking on the task? Don’t worry about who would have been available, we’re just talking about an ideal world.

GRRM I think can match RJ in narrative style. My concern with him would have been I’m not sure he could have kept to the script, and I wouldn’t want to see the WoT universe devolve into that of ASOIAF. But I don’t think he’d have done that, I think he’d have respected RJ’s world.

Another author I’d have been okay with is R Scott Bakker. I consider his narrative style marvellous and I think he could have done justice to RJ’s world.

Long Time Reader, avoided this sub for obvious reasons, but needed to share. Spoilers up to The Gathering Storm (AMOL Pt. 2) I've be reading WoT for years, and it's taken me a long time since I was going to uni and didn't have much time to share with these tomes. However, I just finished book 12 and felt I needed to share.

Spoiler Screen------------------------------------------------------------

\--------------------------------

\--------------------------------

\--------------------------------

After reading it I was surprised at the more 'relaxed' story arc that Rand finishes on. It didn't all come together until I read the associated lines in the Karaethon Cycle after the Epilogue. And now I see this incredible moment, written humbly such that I didn't quite get what was happening. It brought me back to Rand in the first books, scared and trying to evade his fate. Yet at the same time, there was an incredible grandness to it, as he stood capable of bringing the world to its knees from Dragonmount. There was an incredible tension, entirely contained within one character, which I have not seen probably ever, with conflicting ideas and motivations coming to a head so completely in a quiet scene. At one point I was unsure of whether or not he would actually do it, and I applaud Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for bringing me that moment. After Crossroads of Twilight and Knife of Dreams, some of the plotlines had grown a tad tedious to me in all honesty, but wrapping up some of these big threads has really invigorated my interest. Just wanted to know if anyone else connected with the scene as strongly / thoughts?

TL;DR Rand's final scene in TGS was incredible, and has stuck with me for days now, and I wanted to see what the community thought. No spoilers please, I've worked for this series too long. Burn me, but I have!

Sony should reconsider the whole project, because it's heading to a very wrong direction Based on two "announcements" we can see that the writers dictate a very fast, a too fast, tempo: it looks like they will cut everything which is not action. Hence they want to present the first book in 4-5 episodes. A typical length for an episode is usually 50 minutes, ergo they want to turn TEOTW into a 3.5-4 hours entertainment. Unfortunately, they want to present the whole series, which means similar fate awaits for the other books too.


That's where I say that they would get a better result making real movies instead of doing a small screen adaption.


Harry Potter, Marvel, F and F etc. proved that the audience can (and want!) watch franchise films in every year. There is lack of big fantasy films right now, and WOT could be a very successful movie franchise.


Making movies means that they could use more money, and, obviously, they could reach a wider viewership.

(SPOILERS AMOL)Just finished WOT... This journey took me 12 years - I could have wrapped it up sooner but I didn't want to, I was very hesitant to read the last book - I didn't want to deal with the inevitable death of characters I'd come to love over the years.
I didn't want to face the fact that the story would truly come to an end.

Also I should have stayed clear from googling WOT because I did get spoilered over the years!
I think personally the biggest spoiler was that Egwene would die I tried to trick my brain in forgetting that piece of information - I even delayed reading the final book for 1 year but it didn't work

I don't really know how to feel right now - I don't have any other series that I can dive straight into so I feel a bit sad, &amp; empty :(

And I'm somewhat disappointed with the end, I mean it's a good end, better than what we could have hoped for, but I kinda wish they would have shown more as to what happened to the characters

This is the first time I finished the series, I've read a lot of books more than once, I think I've read book 1-3 around 10 times 3-7 around 4-5 times - I never really got stuck in a book itself but stuck in real life where I'd take a break from reading and that break would take so long that when I wanted to pick it up again I would have to start with book 1 again
But by having those rereads the characters &amp; the world truly grew on me, more so than if I had just read it once I suppose.

Anyway I'm rambling but I just felt I needed to find people to talk to

I'm also a total newbie to Reddit so I have no idea how to hide spoilers

Which characters do you think should have an increased role or focus in the TV show? One thing I think Game of Thrones did right was increase the focus on some of the minor characters who were the series' fan favorites, like The Hound and Brienne of Tarth. With WoT, there are so many minor characters that they'll likely cut some out and increase the role of others. Who would you like to see given more to do?

What would YOU cut from the Wheel of Time show? Congrats, you are now Rafe Judkins.

Amazon has given you a 7 season (13 episode per season) commitment for your Wheel of Time show. Immediately you realize that you are going to have to cut multiple side-plots (and some side characters) in order to streamline the series into 90 episodes.

What do you cut and/or combine? Who is the Tom Bombadil of WoT?

[Spoilers All] Most disturbing scene in WoT Overall, Wheel of Time is a lot more PG than some other series (looking at you, GRRM), but it has its moments. What do you consider the most disturbing scenes in WoT?

I’m rereading TSR, and for me it’s the scene in the Stone when Rand tries to revive the dead girl. His delusions of grandeur holding Callandor; his desperation; the descriptions of what he does; and Moiraine imploring him to stop. It’s all so well written and really paints a gruesome picture, not just of the scene but of the state of mind.

Introducing my wife and her best friend to WoT through the WoT RPG? So. My wife is not NEARLY as nerdy as me. Granted, I think she would enjoy a lot of the things I enjoy, IF she had the patience to learn about them, which she often does not. There are times, however, when I make her sit through something that is a favorite of mine and really make an effort because I just KNOW she will love it, and once she gets past the initial frustration of introductions/setup/learning she usually falls in love with the world or story and becomes a huge fan of the thing.

My wife understands how much I love the WoT series (even going so far as to get me an awesome framed map when i finished the series), but though I've tried to have her read EOTW and she just did not seem interested in the writing style. I even tried reading it to her and she kept falling asleep after like one page in the prologue (i get it, each book starts off slow). She doesn't even KNOW about so many parts of the world she's missing out on!

One of her favorite things (which I did NOT introduce her to, she was always a fan of the books as a kid) is Harry Potter. We are very close with another couple and I've gotten the husband (he is very nerdy like me) to read WoT and he's loving it, he's on book 6 now. His wife (equally as not-nerdy as my wife) is also a big Harry Potter fan.

Well, I came up with a plan. I've never been a tabletop RPG fan as of yet, but I'm thinking about learning just for this plan. She has agreed to do it and be as open as she can be because she knows how much I love this world and it could be a good chance to learn about it in detail WITHOUT reading the books (yet..i'm hopeful).  My plan is to learn how to, and run, a Wheel of Time RPG adventure (5e conversion found online), in which I will be the GM. And I will guide my friend, his wife, and my wife through a SHORT adventure in the white tower, in which the two girls are perhaps Novices or Accepted that get caught up in a web of darkfriends and secret happenings around Tar Valon and the White Tower.

I'm hoping that in giving the adventure a rich back story and answering inevitable questions about the world, will ignite some interest in the greater world of Randland for her. I'm also hoping that having one of her best friends play with her, and them being magic users in the tower (closest we can get to Harry Potter in WoT lol) will give her a sense of familiarity to keep her interested enough to play. The challenge is making something that is as easy and simple as possible. I will probably create the characters for the girls, for example.

**tl;dr:** This huge wall of text just to say, I would love any input you other WoT fans have, or advice on interesting ways to grab the attention of a non-reader, or tips on creating an RPG adventure for complete noobs. Any thoughts on this approach, in general? Any suggestions for a different approach to try to introduce someone to the series in a friendly way?

New WoT story in Unfettered III For those who are unaware, Unfettered III is coming out this year, and it includes a story written by "Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson". Details have not yet been announced officially, but should be this week.  Shawn Speakman has said what Brandon decided to contribute should make fans of epic fantasy happy, and a new WoT story should surely do that! ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/92o4x1/the\_anthology\_unfettered\_is\_available\_in\_299\_ebook/e38vuyv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/92o4x1/the_anthology_unfettered_is_available_in_299_ebook/e38vuyv)) If you weren't aware, the story "River of Souls" was published in the first Unfettered anthology.

Though it hasn't been officially announced, the Amazon description gives a nice clue what the story will be about. Here it is, spoilered for those who don't want to know yet: (aMoL spoilers, kind of)

&gt;!"Travel the Ways with Robert Jordan &amp; Brandon Sanderson." I think it's pretty likely that this will be the story of Perrin cleansing the Ways; Brandon has said that he originally intended for that to happen in aMoL, but it was ultimately cut.!&lt;

[https://smile.amazon.com/Unfettered-III-Tad-Williams/dp/1944145230/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533152057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=unfettered+iii](https://smile.amazon.com/Unfettered-III-Tad-Williams/dp/1944145230/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533152057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=unfettered+iii)

My bittersweet realization about this sub I just started posting and reading here within the past few months after starting a re-read of the books after years. This isn't the biggest community, but it sure seems like it's really active for a sub its size and most of you guys are really down to earth compared to subs like r/asoiaf and other fan subreddits.

As excited as I am about the upcoming TV show and for WoT to (hopefully) become super popular, it sure will be bittersweet to see this sub change into something... different as interest grows.

Here's to hoping the change will be exciting and  the influx of new fans will be something like a mentorship!

LotR compared with WoT So I'm currently on the 4th book, 1st re-read of WoT. And I'm listening to an audiobook of LotR.

Now I had tried to read LotR many times but found the prose too much for a novel, and the songs turned it into some kind of written musical. But listening to it is amazing.

I am struck by the many similarities in Jordans early books. I know he is often criticized for this.
I'm not goinv to criticize...I love it. Is like Jordan read LotR and was able to expand on it. To take the black riders for example and create fades which come across as much darker/more evil.  To take their journey through a door that had no seems into a dark path and turn it into magic.
To explain the magic system.

What Gandalf can and can't do, isn't really explained.


I am enjoying LotR, It's poetic and beautiful language but it's overall lacking in a "human" feel. In grey chracters, in indepth personality/relationships.

I see in most boom groups, LotR comes out as the better..by many of which havent completed WoT series.

I'm curious here, will WoT be preferred or are they both recognised for their strong points?
I feel there's a very good chance WoT would never have existed without LotR and though I can admire the literary masterpiece that LotR is, I find so far that it's overall lacking as a story, albeit I'm still very much enjoying it.

Hello my name is Gethesmane and I'm an unapologetic Wheel of Time junkie. I've recently started working on a WoT project of my own that I'm going to be posting on this subreddit. This might be a bit long but you shouldn't mind since you've either read or listened to the Wheel of Time.


Ok first things first. My name is Gethesmane (obviously a pseudonym ) and I'm a 29 year old male office worker with a bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature from the American University in Cairo. I have read the entire Wheel of Time series about 30-35 times since it was completed in 2012 and about 70 or so times from 1997 - 2012.

I've been to every single WoT website at one point or another  and listened to every podcast multiple times and watched all the Wheel of Time videos on youtube.

I considered podcasting about the Wheel of Time but rejected this idea since English is my second language and I happen to have an accent and also occasionally stutter.

So I've decided to post excerpts from all the books every few chapters or so with quite a bit of commentary from yours truly about scenes from the book that affected me in some way be it in a positive or negative manner.

Wot Junkie presents : Prologue of the Eye of the World This is the first and last time I'm going to apologize for the quality of these posts but I'm doing it to enjoy myself and share my love of the Wheel of Time.

Prologue

**The palace still shook occasionally as the earth rumbled in memory, groaned as if it would deny what had happened. Bars of sunlight cast through rents in the walls made motes of dust glitter where they yet hung in the air. Scorch-marks marred the walls, the floors, the ceilings. Broad black smears crossed the blistered paints and gilt of once-bright murals, soot overlaying crumbling friezes of men and animals which seemed to have attempted to walk before the madness grew quiet. The dead lay everywhere, men and women and children, struck down in attempted flight by the lightnings that had flashed down every corridor, or seized by the fires that had stalked them, or sunken into stone of the palace, the stones that had flowed and sought, almost alive, before stillness came again. In odd counterpoint, colorful tapestries and paintings, masterworks all, hung undisturbed except where bulging walls had pushed them awry. Finely carved furnishings, inlaid with ivory and gold, stood untouched except where rippling floors had toppled them. The mind-twisting had struck at the core, ignoring peripheral things.**

I've always been struck by the horror of the sheer waste in life and material to this great palace especially when you consider it's a microcosm of what's happening all over the world at this very moment

**Lews Therin Telamon wandered the palace, deftly keeping his balance when the earth heaved. “Ilyena! My love, where are you?”**

Hello Kinslayer. It's nice to see you again but I prefer your Re-incarnation aka Rand al'Thor. By the way Ilyena lies dead by your feet.

**Behind him the air rippled, shimmered, solidified into a man who looked around, his mouth twisting briefly with distaste. Not so tall as Lews Therin, he was clothed all in black, save for the snow-white lace at his throat and the silverwork on the turned-down tops of his thigh-high boots**

Hi, Ishamael. Nice to see my favorite villain in all fantasy especially looking so chic and thanks for showing us Travelling for the first time and with th True Power to boot.

**Elan Morin grimaced. “Look at you,” he said scornfully. “Once you stood first among the Servants. Once you wore the Ring of Tamyrlin, and sat in the High Seat. Once you summoned the Nine Rods of Dominion. Now look at you! A pitiful, shattered wretch. But it is not enough. You humbled me in the Hall of Servants. You defeated me at the Gates of Paaran Disen. But I am the greater, now"**

Ok there are a few things to unpack here and they are :

 (1) Lew Therin is a Somebody especially with all those titles.

(2) This has to be one of R.J's nods to Tolkien (Nine Rods of Dominion to Nine Rings of Power)

(3) One of three references to Merlin in the series. (i)Ring of Tamyrlin (ii) Amyrlin Seat (iii) Thomdril Merrilin

4) Ishamael couldn't sound more like a Dark Lord if he tried. He sounds almost exactly like Darth Vader just before his final Battle with Obi-wan Kenobi

**Lews Therin raised his head, and the black-clad man took an involuntary step back from that gaze. “Ten years, Betrayer,” Lews Therin said softly, the soft sound of steel being bared. “Ten years your foul master has wracked the world. And now this. I will. .**

Ok, a sane Lews Therin's gaze can be very scary even to someone like Ishamael but unfortunately Rand's gaze doesn't level up until the Fires of Heaven in the Sun Palace's Throne Room in Cairhien when the various lords and ladies swear fealty to him and they become terrified because the look in Rand's eyes.

**“Ten years! You pitiful fool! This war has not lasted ten years, but since the beginning of time. You and I have fought a thousand battles with the turning of the Wheel, a thousand times a thousand, and we will fight until time dies and the Shadow is triumphant!” He finished in a shout, with a raised fist, and it was Lews Therin’s turn to pull back, breath catching at the glow in the Betrayer’s eyes.**

Hey Ishamael can do the scary eyes too. I've always loved the long wars in fantasy and a war that goes on forever through incarnations just hits the spot for me. Also this why Elan Morin Tedronai fell because logically speaking through all the iterations Shai'tan should win once and if he does win then it's gameover so best to join up now.

**Carefully Lews Therin laid Ilyena down, fingers gently brushing her hair. Tears blurred his vision as he stood, but his voice was iced iron. “For what else you have done, there can be no forgiveness, Betrayer, but for Ilyena’s death I will destroy you beyond anything your master can repair. Prepare to—”**

Balefire!!!! Lews Therin was gonna unleash Balefire on Ishamael because that's the only thing that would have stopped his un-natural resurrection. Imagine what would have happened if he'd just balefired Ishamael without threats or warnings, seriously just imagine how the world would have recuperated:

(1)Ishamael wouldn't be free for the first 40 years of the Breaking of the World possibly making the Breaking less worse.

(2) The Trolloc Wars could have been averted or at least been seriously weakened allowing humanity to keep much of it's strength.

(3)The Black Ajah wouldn't have been created by Ishamael and so the White Tower could have been more than just a bullshit figurehead:
(i) Greens actually being stationed in the Borderlands to be a true Battle Ajah.
 (ii) Yellows actually traveling around the world healing the sick and wounded and also have some based in the borderlands(
(iii)The Whites could have formed an R and D department to solve problems
(iv) Browns instead of just studying and forsaking the outside world could establish schools and centers of learning
 (v)Get rid of that bloody arbitrary recruiting ae limit and increase the Aes Sedai on the rolls.

(4) Even if the Ten Nations had dissolved organically with kingdoms replacing them and the Artur Hawkwing would have ruled over a much stronger empire that would have avoided the following pitfalls:
(i)Hawkwing wouldn't start the Aes Sedai purge and the Siege of Tar Valon
(ii)When he got sick he could have an Aes Sedai Heal him
(iii) He wouldn't have sent his heirs off to Seanchan and Shara and even if his Empire ultimately dissolved Humanity would have remained strong and not receded due to the War of the Hundred Years.

 **His howl beat at the walls, the howl of a man who had discovered his soul damned by his own hand, and he clawed at his face as if to tear away the sight of what he had done. Everywhere he looked his eyes found the dead. Torn they were, or broken or burned, or half-consumed by stone. His own sons and daughters, sprawled like broken dolls, play stilled forever. All slain by his hand. His children’s faces accused him, blank eyes asking why, and his tears were no answer. The Betrayer’s laughter flogged him, drowned out his howls. He could not bear the faces, the pain. He could not bear to remain any longer. Desperately he reached out to the True Source, to tainted saidin, and he Traveled.**

After reading this I could never begrudge the Lew Therin persona that kept ranting and raving in Rand's head because this realization of what he had done in his madness was just abjectly fucking awful and then begging the Light for forgiveness before drawing on impossible to handle and remain in existence levels of the One Power.

**At last the wind died, the earth stilled to trembling mutters. Of Lewis Therin Telamon, no sign remained. Where he had stood a mountain now rose miles into the sky, molten lava still gushing from its broken peak. The broad, straight river had been pushed into a curve away from the mountain, and there it split to form a long island in its midst. The shadow of the mountain almost reached the island; it lay dark across the land like the ominous hand of prophecy. For a time the dull, protesting rumbles of the earth were the only sound.**

Hello Dragonmount can't wait to see you again in The Gathering Storm Chapter 50 Veins of Gold. Also Happy Birthday to Tar Valon who would ultimately in some distant time period would be known as the Isle of Avalon and a resting place for the High King Arthur Pendragon.

WoT Junkie Presents: Chapter 1 of the Eye of the World **The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.**

Seriously this beginning always gets to me it’s like I’m one of Pavlov’s dogs and that bell just rang and my mind just fucking perks up to go on another adventure but then I remember the series is over and there won’t be any new stories and so I just start all over again. Also hello the Misty Mountains; I thought I left you guys back in my re-read of the Tolkien Universe.

**Gusts plastered Rand al’Thor’s cloak to his back, whipped the earth-colored wool around his legs, then streamed it out behind him. He wished his coat were heavier, or that he had worn an extra shirt. Half the time when he tried to tug the cloak back around him it caught on the quiver swinging at his hip. Trying to hold the cloak one-handed did not do much good anyway; he had his bow in the other, an arrow nocked and ready to draw As a particularly strong blast tugged the cloak out of his hand, he glanced at his father over the back of the shaggy brown mare. He felt a little foolish about wanting to reassure himself that Tam was still there, but it was that kind of day.**

Look a living Bela and a boyish Rand. Can you believe that in just two years this 20-year-old sheltered shepherd becomes a King then a Sith Lord and finally ends up Zen Jesus Rand.

**The rider’s cloak covered him to his boot tops, the cowl tugged well forward so no part of him showed. Vaguely Rand thought there was something odd about the horseman, but it was the shadowed opening of the hood that fascinated him. He could see only the vaguest outlines of a face, but he had the feeling he was looking right into the rider’s eyes. And he could not look away.**

**Queasiness settled in his stomach. There was only shadow to see in the hood, but he felt hatred as sharply as if he could see a snarling face, hatred for everything that lived. Hatred for him most of all, for him above all things.**

**Abruptly Rand realized what had been odd about the horseman, aside from his being there at all. The wind that beat at Tam and him had not so much as shifted a fold of that black cloak. His mouth was suddenly dry. He must have imagined it. His father was right; this was a morning to prickle a man’s imagination. But he did not believe it. Only, how did he tell his father that the man who had apparently vanished into air wore a cloak the wind did not touch?**

Look our first wild Myrddraal; note the pale eyeless head, the hatred of all living things and the fear his gaze creates in humans. Also, there is the way they are so obviously unnatural that the very laws of creation don’t apply to them and them being out of phase with creation gives them their abilities. By the way do you remember when the Myrddraal were a serious threat and then suddenly they become the Shadow’s red shirts.

**He was hoping his father had not noticed he was afraid when Tam said, “Remember the flame, lad, and the void.”**
 **“It was an odd thing Tam had taught him. Concentrate on a single flame and feed all your passions into it—fear, hate, anger—until your mind became empty. Become one with the void, Tam said, and you could do anything. Nobody else in Emond’s Field talked that way. But Tam won the archery competition at Bel Tine every year with his flame and his void. Rand thought he might have a chance at placing this year himself, if he could manage to hold onto the void. For Tam to bring it up now meant he had noticed, but he said nothing more about it.**

God bless Tam al’ Thor because by teaching Rand this technique he gave him the tool that would allow him to become one of the deadliest men in the world with both the sword and the One Power.

**Most of the men rolled their shoulders and said, “Well, we’ll survive, the Light willing.” Some grinned and added, “And if the Light doesn’t will, we’ll still survive.”**

**That was the way of most Two Rivers people. People who had to watch the hail beat their crops or the wolves take their lambs, and start over, no matter how many years it happened, did not give up easily. Most of those who did were long since gone.**

Here’s our first look at the notorious Two Rivers stubbornness

**That was why they had not accepted any of the invitations to stop for a bite to eat or something hot to drink. When they saw Tam, the goodwives of Emond’s Field went on point like hounds spotting a rabbit. There was not a one of them who did not know just the perfect wife for a widower with a good farm, even if it was in the Westwood.**

Here's proof that the women of Emond’s Field have good taste because Tam al’Thor is awesome and he should end up with someone especially after he said goodbye to his son maybe for the last time. God knows Rand’s funeral sometimes makes me tear up for Tam’s sake.

**Bran al’Vere appeared from the inn, seeming as always to step too lightly for a man of his girth, nearly double that of anyone else in the village.. The innkeeper was in his shirtsleeves despite the chill, with a spotless white apron wrapped around him**

Remember this is how you know if an innkeeper. Fat and clean apron is good but skinny or dirty apron means bad dude.

**“The Dark One and all of the Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul, beyond the Great Blight, bound by the Creator at the moment of Creation, bound until the end of time. The hand of the Creator shelters the world, and the Light shines on us all.” He drew another breath and went on. “Besides, if he was free, what would the Shepherd of the Night be doing in the Two Rivers watching farmboys?**

I wouldn’t be sure that all the Forsaken are bound or at least not bound till the end of time. Also I love the Old Tongue and how it’s a bunch of different languages smashed together, I’m bring this up because in Arabic Shayol Ghul means “Thing of the Demon”.
Ok that’s it for now see you tomorrow for more chapters .

[Knife of Dreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/8souaa/spoilers_kod_thoughts_after_finishing_knife_of/)

Before I begin let me remind you that the scope of spoilers on this post is up to The Gathering Storm, please don't discuss anything after.

We come now to the first of the Sanderson books. Does it hold up to the rest of the series?

**Stuff I Liked**

* Veins of Gold: You'd think the thing you would remember most about a book where Rand goes a balefirin' after two Forsaken would be amazing plot moments. But The Gathering Storm's greatest achievement is the development of Rand's character. Rand's total dedication to his mission to kill the Dark One at expense of his emotions has been building over the last several books. Three scenes spring to mind as absolutely heartbreaking: Rand choking Min, his conversation with Nynaeve before going after Graendal (Dream on my behalf, Nynaeve. Dream for things I no longer can), and meeting Tam. Deep down he wants to love these people but feels that his destiny does not allow him. All of this culminates in the catharsis on Dragonmount. Such a beautiful arc throughout this book.

* The White Tower Stands- We finally reached the conflict between White Tower and rebels that we've been waiting the majority of the series for. I'll dig a little more into the Elaida v Egwene stuff later but Egwene did a good job of rallying all the Aes Sedai to her cause. Then of course we get the awesome Seanchan attack. Think back to the beginning of the series where the mighty White Tower was this eternal power, then cut to raken-riding damane blowing hole in the Tower itself to kidnap the sisters within. Loved Egwene's defense using the novices as a circle, she really flexes her Power muscles along with her political ones throughout the book.

* Verin- This is an interesting one for me. Since Moiraine luchador-ed out of here Verin has been my favorite Aes Sedai. So it blew my mind a couple books ago when I got spoiled that she was Black Ajah, which has since colored my perception of her. I had prepared myself for her to reveal herself as a bad guy. Then I get hit with the double twist as she has actually been a double agent this whole time, in the most badass, yet most Brown Ajah way possible. I find the list of Black Ajah sisters a little too convenient (makes Egwene's life a whole lot easier) but it was still a great way for Verin to go out.

* Dragon and Amyrlin- I thought it was neat to devote a whole book almost entirely on Egwene and Rand. It gave the book a very focused feeling.

**Stuff I Didn’t Like**

* Gawyn: Damn it, he's back. I've always thought Gawyn was super lame and honestly give zero fucks about his romance subplot with Egwene. He does his very best to ruin all of Egwene's plans by leading the rescue into Tar Valon. I really really don't like following this chucklefuck around and am very sad he will be back to ruin my day some more. #TeamGalad

* Elaida: One of the most interesting antagonists in the series has been Elaida. She isn't evil, but just horribly misguided. I like that she isn't in the Black Ajah, and we see through her POVs that she believes her course of actions are best for the fate of the world. That's why I'm disappointed that her conflict with Egwene ends with her being abducted by Seanchan. Yes, Egwene had kind of already tipped the scales against her but I was hoping for a more direct choice between the two. The Tower Aes Sedai end up never actually having to renounce Elaida's power. This feels very convenient for Egwene, especially because she was going to win anyways. Having Elaida get kidnapped feels like what happened with the end of Galina's story, bad things happening to an antagonist just because they're the antagonist.

* Death of the Prophet: The whole reason Perrin left Rand and went to the west was to find Masema. Then we got sidetracked for three full books finding Faile. And Masema just gets killed off in the prologue? Perrin never sees him again? I have thought that people are a little overly critical of the rescue storyline but now everything that's happened to Perrin recently in terms of plot seems totally irrelevant.

**Who I’d Like to See More Of**

* Last time I had Taim, Logain, Egwene, Aviendha in this section. We got plenty of Egwene but I feel the same for all these guys for pretty much the same reasons.

* Lan: Don't forget, the Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don.

* Mat: We're going to the Tower of Ghenjei next book. Time to go get our homie Moiraine.

* Rand: I want to see how his epiphany has changed him.

**Who I’d Like to See Less Of**

* Siuan: Never been a fan of her. She's tolerable in New Spring but otherwise I find Siuan to be grating. I hope she stays away from Egwene for a while.

* Gawyn: Speaking of staying away from Egwene...

* Cadsuane: For some reason she bugged me a lot in this one. Perhaps it was her insistence that she was in the right after Rand's banishment. Loved Tam blowing up at her rather than being upset with Rand, that's a true parent right there. Also, yes you put a lot of protections on the male a'dam but Semirhage still wound up with it, so you kind of are to blame.

**Miscellaneous**

* Okay so did Brandon Sanderson live up to Robert Jordan? I think on almost all accounts yes and in some ways exceeded The Creator. My one criticism is the same as many (and one Sanderson acknowledged himself) in that he didn't really capture Mat's voice and character, instead writing more of book 2 Mat than book 11 Mat. Other than that I thought he absolutely nailed every other character, with Rand, Nynaeve, and Egwene standing out as feeling just like Jordan wrote them. That is seriously impressive, to take over a series and have it feel very much the same. Like I said up top I thought he did a beautiful job with Rand's descent into darkness.

* Hinderstap would have been a great episode of the Twilight Zone or Star Trek but feels very inorganic here. I think it could have been cut completely. Now that I'm thinking about Mat's storyline, I thought Verin's mission for him was going to be evil business but now I'm very intrigued. Did she leave the same information to him as she did to Egwene?

* Rand balefired Graendal while she was offscreen. Never assume a character is dead unless you see it happen.

*  I thought it was an interesting decision for Rand's visions of Perrin and Mat to be ahead of where we are in their storylines. Perrin is meeting with Galad and through Tam we learn Morgase has revealed her true identity. I wonder if we will get a chapter of Mat traveling to Caemlyn or if he'll already be there.

* Is this book the first time we get confirmation that Ishamael is Moridin? As in one of the characters actually saying I=M. I mean it was essentially confirmed a while back but I don't remember if anyone actually *says* it.

WoT wiki that’s mindful of spoilers After trying a few times, I finally finished Eye of the World and I’m hooked on WoT. I was wondering if you guys had a favorite wiki/encyclopedia website, possibly one where I could hide all the spoilers from a certain book onward. I’d like to learn about connections and things like that, but not get some reveal that’s three books ahead spoiled. Thanks in advance!

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 2 of the Eye of the World **Mat shrugged. “Nothing, really. I told Adan al’Caar and some of his snot-nosed friends—Ewin Finngar and Dag Coplin—that some farmers had seen ghost hounds, breathing fire and running through the woods. They ate it up like clotted cream.”**

**“And Master Luhhan is mad at you for that?” Rand said doubtfully.**

**“Not exactly.” Mat paused, then shook his head. “You see, I covered two of his dogs with flour, so they were all white. Then I let them loose near Dag’s house. How was I to know they’d run straight home? It really isn’t my fault. If Mistress Luhhan hadn’t left the door open they couldn’t have gotten inside. It isn’t like I intended to get flour all over her house.”**

**He gave a bark of laughter. “I hear she chased old Luhhan and the dogs, all three, out of the house with a broom.”**

Well if the badger hadn't made it clear earlier then this should cement the notion that Mat is a prankster but we also see that sometimes he doesn't think of the consequences because of course the fogs are going to run home.

**Feet clattered on the stairs, and Ewin Finngar half fell into the cellar in his haste, his pudgy face shining with eagerness to impart his news. “There are strangers in the village.”**

**Ewin looked uncertainly from one of them to the other, then spoke quickly when Mat took a threatening step. “Of course I could see his face. And his cloak is green. Or maybe gray. It changes. It seems to fade into wherever he’s standing. Sometimes you don’t see him even when you look right at him, not unless he moves.**

 **And hers is blue, like the sky, and ten times fancier than any feastday clothes I ever saw. She’s ten times prettier than anybody I ever saw, too. She’s a high-born lady, like in the stories. She must be.”**

Well now it's the first mention of Moiraine Damodred and al'Lan Mandragoran, two of the White Tower's wandering royal badasses and they aren't even in disguise.

**The two stones flew true . . . and the raven stepped aside; the stones whistled through the space where it had been. Fluffing its wings once, it cocked its head again, fixing them with a dead black eye, unafraid, giving no sign that anything had happened.
Rand stared at the bird in consternation. “Did you ever see a raven do that?” he asked quietly.**

Our first encounter with the Dark One's eyes and what cemented for me that yes the projogue wasn't a fluke; weird shit would happen because generally birds scatter when you throw things at them. It's a fucking evolutionary imperative that kept them from being killed off.


**Rand’s gaze fell to the woman who had spoken, and her eyes met his. He could only stare.  At least, he could not put any age to her at all. At first he thought she was as young as Nynaeve, but the longer he looked the more he thought she was older than that. There was a maturity about her large, dark eyes, a hint of knowing that no one could have gotten young. For an instant he thought those eyes were deep pools about to swallow him up. It was plain why Mat and Ewin named her a lady from a gleeman’s tale, too.
Altogether she was like no one he had ever seen before.**

 **The wide hood of her cloak framed her face and dark hair, hanging in soft ringlets. He had never seen a grown woman with her hair unbraided; every girl in the Two Rivers waited eagerly for the Women’s Circle of her village to say she was old enough to wear a braid. Her clothes were just as strange. Her cloak was sky-blue velvet, with thick silver embroidery, leaves and vines and flowers, all along the edges. Her dress gleamed faintly as she moved, a darker blue than the cloak, and slashed with cream. A necklace of heavy gold links hung around her neck, while another gold chain, delicate and fastened in her hair, supported a small, sparkling blue stone in the middle of her forehead.**

 **A wide belt of woven gold encircled her waist, and on the second finger of her left hand was a gold ring in the shape of a serpent biting its own tail. He had certainly never seen a ring like that, though he recognized the Great Serpent, an even older symbol for eternity than the Wheel of Time.**

I'm sorry but in retrospect I found this to be a bit ridiculous but in in a good way. If the Two Rivers folk had any real knowledge of the outside world the only way it would be more obvious that Moiraine was an Aes Sedai was if a guy walked followed her around holding a sign saying Moiraine is an Aes Sedai. Seriously; agless face, Great Serpent Ring and a deadly guy in a fancloth cloak.

**“Stories?” Rand said. “What ever happened in the Two Rivers to interest someone like—I mean, what could have happened here?”
Mat scoffed. “Do we have Trollocs in the Two Rivers? We have sheep. I wonder what could ever have happened here to interest someone like her.”**

**“Something could have,” Rand answered slowly. “They say the inn’s been here for a thousand years, maybe more.”**

**“A thousand years of sheep,” Mat said.**

Sure thing Mat; for the last thousand years The Two Rivers was a peaceful place full of sheep but go back another thousand years and then you had Manetheren, one the Ten Nations and a formidable power in it's own right. Also bringing up Trollocs was bad for two reasons:

(i) The Trolloc Wars killed off Manetheren 2000 years ago.
(ii) Trollocs are going to attack you tonight.

**As she left, a tall man Rand had not noticed before moved away from the front of the inn and followed her, one hand resting on the long hilt of a sword. His clothes were a dark grayish green that would have faded into leaf or shadow, and his cloak swirled through shades of gray and green and brown as it shifted in the wind. It almost seemed to disappear at times, that cloak, fading into whatever lay beyond it.**

Ladies and Gentlemen; it's our first look at the deadliest swordsman in all the world. al'Lan Mandragoran. Lord of the Seven Towers. Lord of the Lakes, True Blade of Malkier, Defender of the Wall of First Fires, Bearer of the Sword of the Thousand Lakes, Diademed Battle Lord and the Uncrowned King of Malkier.  Also according to Mat, Lan is not a Warder because he did not have any gold or jewels on him.

**The peddler had come at last. Strangers and a gleeman, fireworks and a peddler. It was going to be the best Bel Tine ever.**

Oh God. I feel so goddamned sorry for Rand at this thought because this Bel Tine will catapult him into a world of such sheer awful agony that will scourge him and destroy his innocence forever.

On January 1st, I started the Wheel of Time. Last night(Aug 5th), I finished the series. Here’s what I thought. Warning: spoilers ahead

Overall, I really enjoyed it. The series is full of twists and turns, and it kept me gripped. Yes, there are some flaws in Jordan’s writing, and there are some books that lull, but I think it was worth my monetary and time investments.

The first thing I want to address is the lull in the middle of the books. I found them easy to get through, as I kinda powered through books 7 and 8 in two weeks. Events still happen, and time still progresses, but it feels like less is happening. This is made worse, imo, by Crossroads of Twilight - book 9 - which seems to take place over the course of the same 12ish hours as the previous books conclusion.

Plot-wise, I found some characters were a lot easier to get on with than others. Early Faile was irritating - especially before and during the journey through the Ways. Nynaeve was unbearable when she was hunting the Black Ajah and in Salidar. Pretty much everything before she married Lan, I think. I also found Mat just kind of hanging around, not doing much of interest until he founded the Band. All I remember was him hanging in Rhuidean, being healed by 13 Aes Sedai of the dagger, and blowing the horn at Falme.

Rand’s development throughout the series was done pretty well. The whole thing about him running away in book 3 was kind of strange, Altho I can’t really remember how he ended up in the Waste, so it doesn’t matter too much. He was missing a lot more in some of the later books as Jordan, and then Sanderson, had to die up other plots. Cuendillar Rand sent chills down my spine, but I loved that part of him! Although we needed Jesus Rand to win the war at the end anyway. He wouldn’t have won against Shai’tan otherwise.

Moving on to Mat. As said earlier, he didn’t do much for the first like 6 books. Once the Band formed, everything was underway for him. Tylin was awful, and then when I realised just who the Daughter of the Nine Moons was. Well, that was a shock. Gods, I really didn’t like Tuon much. I still maintain that the Ashandarei was the coolest weapon throughout though. His luck was probably the most visible/useful of all three Ta’veren powers, until Jesus Rand came along.

Perrin. His love for Faile was heartwarming, especially at the end. In some ways, he was my favourite of the three boys. He just wanted to do his thing, and he was looking out for himself as best he could with the situation he was given. Looking after the Two Rivers, hunting after Faile instead of taking Masema straight to Rand - I don’t blame him there at all. And it dealt with the Shaido threat. I still didn’t pick up Mins viewing about the Falcon and the Swan - Altho I need to go google what Berelains symbol was. The wolf stuff... Hoppers death was one of the biggest shocks, although I still don’t understand what Slayer was. Still, Perrin in the wolf dream was really cool, especially as the story went on. I really didn’t like the whole Perrin V Galad plot, though. It almost felt tacked on. Galad has been a minor character up to now (I don’t even remember him training at the white tower) and the only point to the conflict seemed to be to reveal Morgase. Perrin was going to Elayne anyway, the reveal could still have come. God damn it.

Egwene. There were some real twists in her plot. Just casually recreating Travelling? Becoming the Amyrlin seat? Being captured by the White Towerand becoming a Novice again! And then that one Verin scene. Jesus Christ, I felt dizzy from all the twists in that one scene! All the stuff going on elsewhere at the time didn’t help either! Jeez. But then... her death was, almost poetic. After Gawyn died, and then bonding with Leilwin. I really liked Egwene, after she got out of Moiraine’s shadow. You go girl!

Elayne. I don’t really have any strong feelings or opinions about her, which surprises me. I enjoyed her story, nothing really major. She knows how to make TerAngreal, which I think is super cool. I would have loved to see Jordan dig a bit more into that process. And trapping Moghedian with Nynaeve? Damn. I thought her whole crusade to become queen of Andor was pretty boring - too much politics - especially in contract of Carhien taking all of an hour and a half, max. (Tying the two countries together the way she did was pretty clever though)

Nynaeve. Gods she was annoying for a good 7+ books. I liked her when she was with Rand at the end, and when she figured out how to heal stilling/gentling and even the madness on the Asha’man. I haven’t really got much to say on her. She kept her head in a crisis. I didn’t see her being as important as she was - or even popping up after they left the Two Rivers.

Highlights of the series? Dumai’s Wells, for sure. The whole Last Battle. Cleaning the One Power - I never saw that one actually succeeding until it did. The attack on the Stone as well. The unification of the white tower and the following Seanchan attack, and the Tower of Genjei.

Low points of the series. Crossroads of twilight, Samnaels death - it was almost tacked on to the end of the book, and Rand even ignored everything he’d been building up for a whole book by then. (Even if that was his plan). Perrin v Galad. That’s all I can think of, to be honest.

I also want to thank Brandon Sanderson for finishing the series (/u/Mistborn) - Knowing he finished it and how important of a series it was to him was the reason I chose to pick the first book up anyway. And it was worth it. There were points or story elements I hit that I though (that’s this in Stormlight Archive), so that’s fun too.

So, there we go. I loved the series, and if you can stick with it, I’d highly recommend that you read them too. Jordan’s writing isn’t for everyone, and the story isn’t perfect, but there we go. I mostly avoided spoilers - no going on the wiki, or the forums/reddit, and no looking for fanart.  (I knew Moiraine was coming back, that was about it), but I want to give thanks to the 17th Shard discord for being aware of what I have and haven’t read and censoring their conversations pretty much just for me. (Although I think I convinced someone else to start listening to WoT as well) There are no endings to the Wheel of Time, but it was _an_ ending.

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 3 of the Eye of the World **The man on the wagon was Padan Fain, a pale, skinny fellow with gangly arms and a massive beak of a nose. Fain, always smiling and laughing as if he knew a joke that no one else knew, had driven his wagon and team into Emond’s Field every spring for as long as Rand could remember.**

Yes, the joke is that he is an evil perverted motherfucker who's been a darkfriend for over 40 years.

**The peddler gave the Council and villagers alike exactly the same attention as he fussed with tying his reins off just so, which was to say hardly any attention at all.**


Why would he pay them attention when he's the point man for the first Trolloc raid south of the Borderlands since the freaking Trolloc Wars

**Perrin Aybara shouted at Rand over the clamor. Half a head shorter than Rand, the curly-haired blacksmith’s apprentice was so stocky as to seem a man and a half wide, with arms and shoulders thick enough to rival those of Master Luhhan himself**

Hello Perrin. It's nice to see a non emo Perrin before he started on the oh me oh my Wolfbrother phase and then the Faile obsession  (Seriously the Pattern can burn if he gets Faileback safe) . Nice to see the ta'veren protagonist  trio when they're just country youths.

**“War?” Master al’Vere’s mouth fit awkwardly around the unfamiliar word. No one in the Two Rivers had ever had anything to do with a war. “Why are they having a war?**

Um, Ok. Looks at the guy next to Bran and scratches head while wondering why no one's ever asked Tam al'Thor about his years outside. I mean having joined the army of Illian, and serving in the Whitecloak War and the last two wars with Tear. In time he rose to be a blademaster and the Second Captain of the Companions and finally retiring and returning home after the Aiel War.

**Fain grinned, and Rand had the feeling he was mocking the villagers’ isolation from the world, and their ignorance. The peddler leaned forward as if he were about to impart a secret to the Mayor, but his whisper was meant to carry and did. “The standard of the Dragon has been raised, and men flock to oppose. And to support.”**

**“Not the Dark One,” Haral Luhhan growled. “The Dragon’s not the Dark One. And this is a false Dragon, anyway.”**

**“Let’s hear what Master Fain has to say,” the Mayor said, but no one would be quieted that easily. People cried out from every side, men and women shouting over one another.**

**“Just as bad as the Dark One!”**

**“The Dragon broke the world, didn’t he?”**

**“He started it! He caused the Time of Madness!”**

**“You know the prophecies! When the Dragon is reborn, your worst nightmares will seem like your fondest dreams!”**

**“He’s just another false Dragon. He must be!**

Seriously it's no wonder why Rand was in denial about his being the Dragon Reborn if these thoughts  are what he's lived with his whole life.

**Rand could remember every tale he had heard about the men who named themselves the Dragon Reborn, and if they had all proven themselves false Dragons by dying or disappearing without fulfilling any of the prophecies, what they had done was bad enough. Whole nations torn by battle, and cities and towns put to the torch. The dead fell like autumn leaves, and refugees clogged the roads like sheep in a pen.**

**“Is this a false Dragon?” the thatcher asked sourly.
Master al’Vere blinked as if taken by surprise, then snapped,
“Don’t be an old fool, Cenn!” But Cenn had kindled the crowd again.**

**“He can’t be the Dragon Reborn! Light help us, he can’t be!”**

**“You old fool, Buie! You want bad luck, don’t you?”**

**“Be naming the Dark One, next! You’re taken by the Dragon, Cenn Buie! Trying to bring us all harm!”**

Also why he would never be a False Dragon having those stories etched in his mind  and why I believe he'd have went to the Wild if he'd just been a normal channeler and not the prophesized Savior of the World.

**Ewin Finngar burst out,“He’ll go mad and die! In the stories, men who channel the Power always go mad, and then waste away and die. Only women can touch it. Doesn’t he know that?”**

Ok I have no patience for False Dragons but in the case of Channelers it's like Pringles once you pop you can't stop channeling and so you might as well try out for the starring role of Dragon Reborn.

**Cenn’s wrinkled face grew darker with every word from Tam and the Mayor, until it was almost purple. “You know what kind of women he’s talking about. Stop frowning at me, Luhhan, and you, too, Crawe. This is a decent village of decent folk, and it’s bad enough to have Fain here talking about false Dragons using the Power without this Dragon-possessed fool of a boy bringing Aes Sedai into it. Some things just shouldn’t be talked about, and I don’t care if you will be letting that fool gleeman tell any kind of tale he wants. It isn’t right or decent.”**

In this backwater of Andor the Aes Sedai are  basically anathema and nearly
as disliked as male channelers. Which makes the trio's distrust for Moiraine eminently logical and for my part I disliked (maybe hated) her until she stopped trying to control in the Fires of Heaven after the Darkhound attack.

**Rand ignored the crowd. He took a seat on the edge of the old stone foundation, gathered his cloak around him, and stared at the inn door. Ghealdan. Tar Valon. The very names were strange and exciting. They were places he knew only from peddlers’ news, and tales told by merchants’ guards. Aes Sedai and wars and false Dragons: those were the stuff of stories told late at night in front of the fireplace, with one candle making strange shapes on the wall and the wind howling against the shutters. On the whole, he believed he would rather have blizzards and wolves.**

Here we're shown that Rand will be the Reluctant sort of Protagonist and he'd have been content living in the Two Rivers being an anti Bilbo Baggins of sorts who after returning to the Shire (Two Rivers) kept on adventuring every now and then.

**Rand added. “Or have you forgotten who caused the Breaking? The Dragon may have started it, but it was Aes Sedai who actually broke the world.”**

**“You think they’re really Darkfriends?” Mat was frowning thoughtfully.**

**“Who?” Rand asked.**

**“Aes Sedai.”**

**“Not all the stories say they serve the Dark One, Rand.”**

**“Light, Mat,” Rand said, “they caused the Breaking. What more do you want?”**

It's ironic that Mat's trying to defend Aes Sedai when later he'll become the member of the trio most anti Aes Sedai and yet again this shows why Moiraine is so distrusted .

**Nynaeve al’Meara stepped into their huddle, the dark braid pulled over her shoulder almost bristling with anger. Rand scrambled to his feet. Slender and barely taller than Mat’s shoulder, at the moment the Wisdom seemed taller than any of them, and it did not matter that she was young and pretty.**

Hello Nynaeve; you are my 3rd favorite female fantasy character of all time after Polgara the Sorceress (#1) and Elmindreda "Min" Farshaw (#2) and it's always a blast to see you. Also in my opinion you're the only female worthy enough to be paired up with the Uncrowned King of Malkier.

**Egwene stood a few paces behind the Wisdom, watching intently. Of a height with Nynaeve, and with the same dark coloring, she could at that moment have been a reflection of Nynaeve’s mood, arms crossed beneath her breasts, mouth tight with disapproval.**

Ugh. It's Egwene.

My most 3rd hated character of all time in the Wheel of Time and one of the Pantheon of despised characters alongside : Ungoliant
, Gollum, Draco Malfoy, Opal Koboi, Minerva Paradizo, Eamon Valda, Masema, Severus Snape, Cersei and Jaime Lannister, Ramsay Snow, Theon Greyjoy and Viserion Targaryen.

I hate lots of other characters  but it would take too long to list them all and I repeat that I hate her more than any other character except Eamon Valda and Daved Hanlon (aka Doilin Mellar)

**Egwene gave an exasperated sigh. “Well, maybe I’m strange, too. Maybe I want to see some of the places I hear about in the stories. Have you ever thought of that?”**

**“Of course I have. I daydream sometimes, but I know the difference between daydreams and what’s real**.”

Here's our 2nd glimpse that while Rand may occasionally daydream about the Outside if he had a choice he'd never leave the Two Rivers.

**“Nynaeve was right,” Egwene announced to the sky when the two youths fell silent. “None of you is ready to be off leading strings. People do ride horses, you know. That doesn’t make them monsters out of a gleeman’s tale.” Rand nodded to himself; it was just as he had thought. She rounded on him. “And you’ve been spreading these tales. Sometimes you have no sense, Rand al’Thor. The winter has been frightening enough without you going about scaring the children.”**

**Rand gave a sour grimace. “I haven’t spread anything, Egwene. But I saw what I saw, and it was no farmer out looking for a strayed cow**

Exhibit 1 of why I hate Egwene.

Anyway thanks for reading and I'll see you guys next time when I post  the next WoT Junkie Presents.

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 4 of the Eye of the World **The door of the inn banged shut behind the white-haired man, and he spun around to glare at it. Lean, he would have been tall if not for a stoop to his shoulders, but he moved in a spry fashion that belied his apparent age. His cloak seemed a mass of patches, in odd shapes and sizes, fluttering with every breath of air, patches in a hundred colors**

**The white-haired man whirled, cloak flaring. His long coat had odd, baggy sleeves and big pockets. Thick mustaches, as snowy as the hair on his head, quivered around his mouth, and his face was gnarled like a tree that had seen hard times. He gestured imperiously at Rand and the others with a long-stemmed pipe, ornately carved, that trailed a wisp of smoke. Blue eyes peered out from under bushy white brows, drilling into whatever he looked at.**


Thomdril "Thom" Merrilin;  gleeman, and, Court Bard at Caemlyn, Master of Daes Dae'mar (The Game of Houses), Twice Cairhienin Regicide (Taringail Damodred and Galldrian Riatin), Future Warder and husband to Moiraine and Damodred finally the possible original source of the Merlin Myth and why there is a Tamyrlin Ring and Amyrlin Seat.

If you haven't guessed by now then allow me to inform you that I absolutely  love this character.

**His voice was still deep, but the resonance had gone, replaced by scorn. “Fain was always one to carry bad news quickly, and the worse, the faster. There’s more raven in him than man.”**

He also is an excellent judge of character.


**The gleeman eyed her for a moment, then smiled broadly. “Now you’re a lovely lass. You should have rose buds in your hair. Unfortunately, I cannot pull roses from the air, not this year, but how would you like to stand beside me tomorrow for a part of my performance? Hand me my flute when I want it, and certain other apparatus. I always choose the prettiest girl I can find as my assistant.”**

Thom as you can see has an appreciation for pretty women which is not surprising given that the three women he had a relationship with were fine looking women ( Morgase, Dena and Moiraine).

**Perrin snickered, and Mat, who had been snickering, laughed out loud. Rand blinked in surprise; Egwene was glaring at him, and he had not even smiled. She straightened around and spoke in a too-calm voice.**

Exhibit 2 of I hate Egwene. Rand didn't do anything and yet she glares at him and ignores Mat and Perrin.

**Suddenly he thrust a finger at Rand. “You, lad. You’re a tall one. Not with your full growth on you yet, but I doubt there’s another man in the district with your height. Not many in the village with eyes that color, either, I’ll wager. The point is, you’re an axe handle across the shoulders and as tall as an Aielman. What’s your name, lad?”**

Um, well Rand's father was an Aiel Clan Chief and possibly a weak ta'veren in his own right considering what he accomplished.

Youngest Taardad Clan Chief in memory; he was mesmerizing and people listened to him, and would follow him, even those not of his clan. He ended the blood feud between Taardad and Nakai after two hundred years, and made alliance not only with the Nakai, but the Reyn, and the Reyn were not far short of blood feud. Also was the Battle Leader for the Aiel when the came west to kill Laman.

**Rand gave it hesitantly, not sure whether or not the man was making fun of him, but the gleeman had already turned his attention to Perrin. “And you have almost the size of an Ogier. Close enough. How are you called?”**

**“Not unless I stand on my own shoulders.” Perrin laughed. “I’m afraid Rand and I are just ordinary folk, Master Merrilin, not made-up creatures from your stories. I’m Perrin Aybara.”**

Ok Perrin.  Whatever you say just make sure not to tell your two non ta'veren best friends; Loial son of Arent son of Halan of Stedding Shangtai and Gaul of the Imran sept of the Shaarad Aiel that they are made up creatures.

Then we have more of the WoT effect where history becomes legendand then Legend becomes Myth:

(i) John Glenn and Sally Ride became Lenn aow he flew to the moon in the belly of an eagle made of fire and his daughter Salya walking among the stars.

(ii)  Ann Landers became Anla, the Wise Counselor.

(iii) Jaem the Giant-Slayer came from Jack the Giant Killer

(iv) The Green Man is the Nym Someshta and possibly they are the source for our own Green Man Legends.

(v) Russian ICBMs became the tales of Mosk the Giant, with his Lance of fire that could reach around the world

(vi) Queen Elizabeth becomes Elsbet, the Queen of All

(vii) Mother Teresa becomes Materese the Healer, Mother of the Wondrous Ind


**Moiraine had joined the listeners. Lan was at her shoulder, though he had to look twice to see the man. For a moment Thom looked at Moiraine sideways, his face and body still except for making the balls disappear into his capacious coat sleeves. Then he bowed to her, holding his cloak wide. “Your pardon, but you are surely not from this district?”**

Thom sure as hell wasn't expecting to see an Aes Sedai here in this backwater.

**“Lady!” Ewin hissed fiercely. “The Lady Moiraine.”**

**Thom blinked, then bowed again, more deeply. “Your pardon again . . . ah, Lady. I meant no disrespect.”**

Thom Merrilin does not stammer and I'm betting he caught himself before he called he Aes Sedai

**Moiraine made a small waving-away gesture. “None was perceived, Master Bard. And my name is simply Moiraine. I am indeed a stranger here, a traveler like yourself, far from home and alone. The world can be a dangerous place when one is a stranger.”**

She knows that he is the man who killed her half brother Taringail
 by the Master Bard and warning him to keep his mouth shut about her  being Aes Sedai.

**“I trust you will like my stories, as well . . . Moiraine.” Thom watched her with obvious wariness. He looked not best pleased to find her there.**

**Thom stared after them, bushy brows drawn down, stroking his long mustaches with a knuckle, until they were halfway up the Green. He’s not pleased at all, Rand thought.**

Nope he's definitely not pleased to see an Aes Sedai.

**“Battles interest me,” Mat said, and Perrin added, “What did he say about them?**

Well Mat that is a good thing because you are The Son of Battles after all

**Battles don’t interest me, Matrim,” Tam said. “But I’m sure he will be glad to tell you all about them later. What does interest me is that we shouldn’t have to worry about them here, as far as the Council can tell. We can see no reason for Aes Sedai to come here on their way south.**

It's ok Tam that you are tired of battles since you fought in at least four separate wars.  Also an Aes Sedai is already here and she's after your son, also it's ironic the only native Two Riversman who could tell that Moiraine hasn't met her because he was on Village Council duty.

What is the important aspect in Wheel of Time that made it great for you? The prophecies. I always thought that the prophecies were amazing. Robert jordan gave us hints to what happens to Rand even from the start.

During a reread, when i read these prophecies i just get goosebumps all over. I am overwhelmed by the feeling.

What do you think makes wot great?

Unpopular opinion: I like Legend of the Seeker Having heard on this sub how a no-no this series was to the not so original books compared to how a WoT show should be, I gave it a try (mainly because it's on YouYube) and... surprize, I actually liked it.

Now I haven't read the books (I only recognised the things in the show that Terry Goodkind stole from Robert Jordan), so I don't know what they did to it (well, I do, reading the howlings on the IMDb page) and granted I wouldn't like WoT to look the same, but IT'S STILL GOOD TELEVISION and an attaching series. If WoT ends up the same, I think I could detach myself from the books and judge the series on its own merits.

Now it may be that is due to the fact that I watched the first 31 episodes dubbed in French (because I can see some serious flaws in the original acting now that I watch the rest of them in English), so I'm curious what did the other versions of the series did to you (especially the French).

On a side note (or maybe the main) I wouldn't mind at all should the main sidekick in this series (Bridget Regan) took the role of Moiraine. She may be 10 years older now, but she still looks the part, at 35.

Does anyone else dislike the audiobooks? First off, two disclaimers: I think WoT is phenomenal, and I listen to a lot of (mostly Fantasy) audiobooks, so it’s not just that I don’t like audiobooks in general.

However ... I just can’t get on with Michael Kramer. I applaud both him and Kate Reading’s dedication to the series (that’s a lot of stuff to read, and a lot of people like their work), but I just don’t like the way he reads - I find it quite jarring and ... over-dramatic? Maybe it’s because I’m British and therefore am not used to his accent, but most other American stuff I listen to is fine.

Anyone else have this issue? Is there another version of audiobook out there, narrated by someone else? It’s not a huge deal (and won’t stop me doing my re-read), but would be interesting to know!

(Spoilers All)What people(inworld) thought about the romantic life of the Dragon Reborn? One thing is consistent with Rand that he breaks the norms. Even when it came to romance.

I know that we already have the reaction from the best person you could get reaction from Rand's Harem(Robert Jordan is a bloody genius for putting Nynaeve the literal best character to witness the love confession of Rand's harem) and i know that the Aiel has a polygamistic lifestyle so probably no surprises in their end (actually they may still have reaction consider the other parts of the harem aren't Aiel).

I mean this was one of the less important parts of Wot so it's understandable that it had less focus but i mean Rand has a very culturally disapproving love life with multiple partners and he didn't even marry any of them while consummating their love.

We know that he represents a sort-off emperor figure so the public probably just accepts the powerful ruler has more than one women but the people close to him or knew him ?

How do you think would Tam Al'Thor react to it ? (he knew Min was his lover but did he know about Aviendha and Elayne ? lol)

Or how would Mat or Perrin react to him having multiple women at the same time ? Or the rest of the edmond fielders ? Even Moiraine's reaction ? Or Loial ? Or Thom ? There's alot of traditionalist when it came to romance from the main cast.

We only know that Nynaeve would box their ears and completely *disapproves* about it. What about the others ?

I wonder which one disapproved or smugly approved or went "who are you ?"

What's a good resource for a new reader? I'm considering starting WoT soon and I've heard that there are many characters and plotlines and it's hard to keep track of everything. Are there any resources that can help with this?

Through some research, I've found [encyclopaedia-wot.org](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/) but the character pages have info listed chronologically and I'm afraid that might spoil something. Also the chapter summaries for the last book aren't completed.

I've also found two companion/reference books, The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time and The Wheel of Time Companion: The People, Places and History of the Bestselling Series. Are these spoiler-free and useful for a first read?

IQ84 - Is it just me or is the writing very ... straight forward I got this on Audible through recommendation and it has high reviews, but I'm finding the style the characters talk to each other to be very straight forward and pretty bland.

Is it just an artifact of translation or will it get better? I'm only ~4 hours in.

I normally read fantasy (WoT, Stormlight Archive) so maybe I'm just not used to books set in the real world.

A question on women in The Wheel of Time - from a new reader. Hi there, I've just completed book 4 of WoT (Shadow Rising) and I'm very much enjoying it. Picked it up on this sub's recommendation in fact. I was just wondering if, without any spoilers, the female characters develop at all out of, well, the one note misandry? I love Egwene, Nynaeve, Elayne, Faile, they're fantastic characters. But they're all defined hugely by complaining, hating, or obsessing about men. It drags a bit, and undermines their strength, I feel at least. Whilst Rand, Perrin and certainly Matt certainly have a lot of comments about women, they just generally feel less definided by it and feel like more complete characters. I don't know. The series is obviously from a different time, I'm just wondering if it eases up at all, at least a little bit?

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 5 of the Eye of the World **Tam nodded but did not stop. When he had made a complete circuit of the house, he did the same around the barn and the sheep pen, still studying the ground. He even checked the smokehouse and the curing shed. Drawing a bucket of water from the well, he filled a cupped hand, sniffed the water, and gingerly touched it with the tip of his tongue. Abruptly he barked a laugh, then drank it down in a quick gulp.**


Here's Tam getting back into soldier mode and making sure that everything is alright and then he laughs at himself for being silly because this is the Two Rivers and nothing bad happens .


**Not everything had been planted, of course; only part, in hopes the cold might break in time to make a crop of some kind before the cellar was empty. It did not take long to finish hoeing, which would have suited him just fine in years past, but now he wondered what they would do if nothing came up this year.**

It's almost as if *Something* is playing around with the weather trying to starve people but that's just silly right?

**The shelf of books by the door was not nearly as long as the one at the Winespring Inn, but books were hard to come by. Few peddlers carried more than a handful, and those had to be stretched out among everyone who wanted them.**

One of the many many ( no this is not a typo) things I like about the Wheel of Times series is the high inworld literacy rate.

**Tam rooted around in a cabinet and came up with a key as long as his hand. He twisted it in the big iron lock on the door. At Rand’s questioning look he said, “Best to be safe. Maybe I’m taking a fancy, or maybe the weather is blacking my mood, but. . . .” He sighed and bounced the key on his palm. “I’ll see to the back door,” he said, and disappeared toward the back of the house.**

**Rand could not remember either door ever being locked. No one in the Two Rivers locked doors. There was no need. Until now, at least.**

The people in Two Rivers never locked their doors and for the life of me I just can't imagine that and I just live in a suburban area but since I was a kid we always made sure that the doors and windows were locked.

**When Tam came back, Rand stared in surprise. A thick belt slanted around Tam’s waist, and from the belt hung a sword, with bronze heron on the black scabbard and another on the long hilt.**


**Slowly Tam drew the weapon; firelight played along the gleaming length. It was nothing at all like the plain, rough blades Rand had seen in the hands of merchants’ guards. No gems or gold adorned it, but it seemed grand to him, nonetheless.**

 **The blade, very slightly curved and sharp on only one edge, bore another heron etched into the steel. Short quillons, worked to look like braid, flanked the hilt. It seemed almost fragile compared with the swords of the merchants’ guards; most of those were double-edged, and thick enough to chop down a tree.**

Say hello to a One Power wrought General's sword from the Age of Legends worth a king's ransom.

**“I got it a long time ago,” Tam said, “a long way from here. And I paid entirely too much; two coppers is too much for one of these.**

By the way for god's sake Tam did not kill Laman to get that sword or kill Laman with that sword; I've seen both theorized and they're wrong because an Aiel did the deed.

**Tam snorted. “Not much use in herding sheep, now is it? Can’t plow a field or harvest a crop with it.” For a long minute he stared at the sword as if wondering what he was doing with such a thing. At last he let out a heavy sigh.**

That's why the Aiel will use any weapon except a sword because it could only be used to kill and had no other purpose.

“**But if I am not just taken by a black fancy, if our luck runs sour, maybe in the next few days we’ll be glad I tucked it in that old chest, instead.”
He slid the sword smoothly back into its sheath and wiped his hand on his shirt with a grimace. “The stew should be ready. I’ll dish it out while you fix the tea.”**

I'm glad that they're finally going to eat because they've had a busy day and only ate honeycakes.

**The creature roared, part scream of pain, part animal snarl, as boiling water splashed over its face. Even as the kettle struck, Tam’s sword flashed. The roar abruptly became a gurgle, and the huge shape toppled back. Before it finished falling, another was trying to claw its way past. Rand glimpsed a misshapen head topped by spike-like horns before Tam struck again, and two huge bodies blocked the door. He realized his father was shouting at him.**

**“Run, lad! Hide in the woods!” The bodies in the doorway jerked as others outside tried to pull them clear. Tam thrust a shoulder under the massive table; with a grunt he heaved it over atop the tangle. “There are too many to hold! Out the back! Go! Go! I’ll follow!”**

**Suddenly one of the windows burst outward in a shower of glass and wood** **as Tam leaped through it, sword still in hand. He landed on his feet, but instead of running away from the house he dashed toward the back of it, ignoring the monstrous things scrambling after him through the broken window and the doorway**

Tamdril al'Thor is still one deadly bastard even after almost 20 years of living a peaceful life.


**“But I had to make sure you didn’t speak out. Some Trollocs can hear like a dog. Maybe better.”**

**“But Trollocs are just. . . .” Rand let the words trail off. Not just a story, not after tonight. Those things could be Trollocs or the Dark One himself for all he knew. “Are you sure?” he whispered. “I mean . . . Trollocs?”**

**“I’m sure. Though what brought them to the Two Rivers. . . . I never saw one before tonight, but I’ve talked with men who have, so I know a little. Maybe enough to keep us alive.**

**Listen closely. A Trolloc can see better than a man in the dark, but bright lights blind them, for a time at least. That may be the only reason we got away from so many. Some can track by scent or sound, but they’re said to be lazy. If we can keep out of their hands long enough, they should give up.”**

Our first infodump and it's not clunky or anything  and that's one of the things about Robert Jordan as an author.

**At the front of the house he lay close beside the wall, beneath the broken window, and listened. The dull thudding of blood in his ears was the loudest sound he heard. Slowly he reared up and peered inside.
The stewpot lay upside down in the ashes on the hearth. Splintered, broken wood littered the room; not a single piece of furniture remained whole.**

**Even the table rested at an angle, two legs hacked to rough stubs. Every drawer had been pulled out and smashed; every cupboard and cabinet stood open, many doors hanging by one hinge. Their contents were strewn over the wreckage, and everything was dusted with white. Flour and salt, to judge from the slashed sacks tossed down by the fireplace.**

**He ran in through the front door and stopped, gagging at the stench. A stable that had not been mucked out in months was the only thing he could think of that might come close to matching it. Vile smears defiled the walls. Trying to breathe through his mouth, he hurriedly began poking through the mess on the floor. There had been a waterbag in one of the cupboards.**


Trollocs are some of the vilest creatures in all of fantasy and off hand I can't think of any race as bad.


**A scraping sound behind him sent a chill to his marrow, and he spun, almost falling over the remains of the table. He caught himself, and moaned behind teeth that would have chattered had he not had them clenched until his jaw ached.**

**One of the Trollocs was getting to its feet. A wolf’s muzzle jutted out below sunken eyes. Flat, emotionless eyes, and all too human. Hairy, pointed ears twitched incessantly**

As a WoT reading veteran I can't believe that this is the same Rand who later could vaporize hundreds of thousands of Trollocs with relative ease.

**It muttered something, guttural and sharp, then said, “Others go away. Narg stay. Narg smart.” The words were distorted and hard to understand, coming from a mouth never meant for human speech. Its tone was meant to be soothing, he thought, but he could not take his eyes off the stained teeth, long and sharp, that flashed every time the creature spoke. “Narg know some come back sometime. Narg wait. You no need sword. Put sword down.”**


Ladies and gentlemen bear witness to the first and last time we ever hear a Trolloc speak in the whole series.

**Abruptly the Trolloc spasmed and was still. Battered and bruised, half suffocated by the bulk on top of him, for a moment Rand could only lie there in disbelief. Quickly he came to his senses, though, enough to writhe out from under the body, at least. And body it was. The bloodied blade of Tam’s sword stood out from the center of the Trolloc’s back.**

Congratulations on your first kill even if it was somewhat accidental, Rand al'Thor Dragon Reborn.

[Spoilers All] A couple of Cadsuane quotes have totally reversed some of my biggest issues with the series I just finished rereading for the millionth time, and this time around I caught something cool that I think might have some pretty big implications for the series as a whole.

One of my biggest problems with WoT is how exasperating the Aes Sedai are 99% of the time.  With the notable exception of Moiraine, the Aes Sedai are arrogant, overconfident, complacent in their knowledge and ability, and generally completely underwhelming.  At the start of the series, the White Tower is established as an all-powerful and all-seeing entity that is secretly pulling the strings in every nation.  However it only takes a couple of books to realize that the vaunted White Tower is actually a paper tiger, and the Aes Sedai are actually pretty weak.  The more other channelers come in contact with the Aes Sedai, the more disappointed and disillusioned they are.  By the end of the series, none of the main groups of channelers view the Aes Sedai as anything more than a potential partner for a student exchange program.

This time around, though, I’m starting to realize it’s not just overconfidence or complacency that caused this slide.

Cadsuane is a polarizing character because she exemplifies all of the worst Aes Sedai characteristics.  She’s arrogant and insufferable, and demands total obedience and respect from everyone around her.  The first few times I read her she was my least favorite character, to the point where Rand telling her to call him Rand Sedai was one of my favorite scenes.  However, I will also grudgingly admit that she’s the most capable Aes Sedai in the series.  Her arrogance is deserved- she generally *does* know what’s better for everyone and everyone *should* show her respect.

I think that Cadsuane’s dismissive attitude towards the other Aes Sedai comes from a specific emotion: disappointment.  Since Cadsuane left the Tower, things have completely gone to shit to the point where the current crop of sisters is well below standard.  While one perspective is that Cadsuane is a Living Legend, I think an alternative viewpoint is that Cadsuane is what an Aes Sedai *should* be, and the current sisters only see her as a legend because they’re horribly undertrained.

In TGS Chapter 5 Cadsuane starts to hint at the issue:  “Of course, Merise and the others- like all the women in the Tower these days- still fell short of what an Aes Sedai should be.   These younger Aes Sedai had been allowed to grow soft and weak, prone to bickering.  Some had allowed themselves to be bullied into swearing fealty to Rand Al’Thor.  Sometimes, Cadsuane wished she could simply send them all to penance for a few decades.”

When we think of the most competent, best Aes Sedai in the series, we find a common denominator: these are all sisters that didn’t spend much time in the Tower.  Cadsuane, Moiraine and Verin are all Aes Sedai that spent most of their time out in the world.  Siuan stayed in the Tower but she was quietly playing her own game as she worked her way up the political ladder.  The Wonder Girls are brand new and have done most of their learning outside the Tower.  Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne all have adventures and experiences that give them seasoning and ability that rivals women that have been Aes Sedai for decades.  Sisters like Vandene and Adeleas are old and have gone into retirement many years ago.

So why is training in the Tower recently a problem?

Chapter 35 of AMOL:  “Cadsuane was increasingly convinced that the Shadow for years had been carrying out a complex plan to undermine the White Tower.  It went deeper than Siuan Sanche’s unfortunate unseating and Elaida’s reign.  It might be decades, centuries, before they understood the extent of the Shadow’s planning.  However, the sheer number of Black sisters- hundreds, not the few dozen Cadsuane had guessed- shouted of what had happened.”

I think the Grand Plan of the Black Ajah was to undermine and sabotage the Tower not just by recruiting sisters to the Shadow, but by also weakening the training of all the Aes Sedai as a whole.  I don’t think this is necessarily Compulsion or some other Power-related scheme, it could instead be as easy as recruiting the Mistress of Novices and subtly fucking with the training methods over time.  I think Cadsuane is disgusted by younger Aes Sedai not because she’s overbearing but because the younger Aes Sedai actually are weak and undertrained.  I think the Wonder Girls are able to command respect and authority in the Aes Sedai not only because of their ability with the power, but also because their experiences outside the tower have strengthened them beyond most modern sisters.  It’s not just Plot Armor, I think the fresh new blood was something the Aes Sedai desperately needed.


To Sum Up:

-Cadsuane isn’t just a jerk, she’s actually right that the Aes Sedai used to be more competent.  As the oldest Aes Sedai Cadsuane is the only one that can recall when the White Tower was more capable.

-The Aes Sedai reputation mismatch compared to their abilities does make sense because the Aes Sedai have only recently declined.  The current generation of sisters is likely the weakest one yet.  It makes sense for groups like the Wise Ones and the Windfinders to shift from awe to disappointment if this decline was a recent event.

-The Wonder Girls aren’t just protected by Plot Armor, they’re genuinely more competent than most sisters because their “training” was outside the tower where they were free from BA machinations.

-Egwene’s Aes Sedai see an explosion of novices and an improvement in novice morale and effectiveness not because Sharina is a genius organizer but because the Tower’s training methods were influenced by the Black Ajah and designed to fail.

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 6 of the Eye of the World Ok; a number of people have pmed me and others have asked me in comments  about my opinion about Egwene and so I'm posting a link that I believe is the final answer on Egwene.

http://www.readandfindout.com/wheeloftime/messageboard/285742/

Now back to the Wot Junkie Presentation.

**In the moonlight Rand could not really see what he was doing, but Tam’s wound seemed to be only a shallow gash along the ribs, no longer than the palm of his hand. He shook his head in disbelief.**

Behold the powerful poison of Thakan’dar wrought weapons and how a simple scratch can be fatal and far superior  fatally to it's literary predecessor the morgul blade.

**Rand grimaced. His mother had been dead fifteen years. If Tam believed she was still alive, then the fever was even worse than Rand had thought. How could he be kept from speaking, now that silence might mean life?**

**“Mother wants you to be quiet,” Rand whispered. He paused to clear his throat of a sudden tightness. She had had gentle hands; he remembered that much. “Kari wants you to be quiet. Here. Drink.”**

I'm sorry for Rand; he lost biological mother at birth and then his adoptive mother at the age of 5. I think that may have boosted his natural Two Rivers/Manetheren/Pseudo-Borderlander need to protect women to it's obsessive level before losing his hand to Semirhage.

**As gently as he could, he lifted Tam onto the litter, wincing with every moan. His father had always seemed indestructible. Nothing could harm him; nothing could stop him, or even slow him down.**

Am I the only one who pictured Arnold Schwarzenegger in T-800 as Tam al'Thor when reading that?

**Slowly weariness crept into his arms and legs, driven home by a night wind that mocked his cloak and coat. The weight of the litter, so little at the start, now tried to pull him to the ground. His stumbles were no longer all from tripping. The almost constant struggle not to fall took as much out of him as did the actual work of pulling the litter.**

 **He had been up before dawn to begin his chores, and even with the trip to Emond’s Field he had done almost a full day’s work. On any normal night he would be resting before the fireplace, reading one of Tam’s small collection of books before going to bed. The sharp chill soaked into his bones, and his stomach reminded him that he had had nothing to eat since Mistress al’Vere’s honeycakes.**

I feel sorry for Rand reading this particularly since today I woke up at noon and then enjoyed a four course lunch with my cousins. (Soup, Appetizers,Main Course  and Dessert.) and after that we rounded out the outing with black mint tea and grape tobacco hookahs.  If you hadn't guessed allow me to inform you that if I could be any fantasy being then I'd be a Hobbiton Hobbit.

**“They came over the Dragonwall like a flood,” Tam said suddenly, in a strong, angry voice, “and washed the land with blood. How many died for Laman’s sin?”**

Can you guess who led the flood over the Dragonwall,Rand?
It's your bio dad; the Battle Leader of this Expedition and Clan Chief of the Taardad Aiel, Janduin.



**“They called them savages,” Tam said urgently. “The fools said they could be swept aside like rubbish. How many battles lost, how many cities burned, before they faced the truth? Before the nations stood together against them?” He loosed his hold on Rand, and sadness filled his voice.**

 **“The field at Marath carpeted with the dead, and no sound but the cries of ravens and the buzzing of flies. The topless towers of Cairhien burning in the night like torches. All the way to the Shining Walls they burned and slew before they were turned back. All the way to—”**

This chapter has always been one of my top 5 favorite chapters in the Wye of the World primarily because of Tam's fever induced hallucination flashbacks . The other 4 favorite chapters  in no particular order are:

(i) Ishamael bringing Rand into his Dreamshard in Baerlon.

(ii) Rand's post Fall off the wall in the Royal Palace of Caemlyn and his subsequent meeting a number of VIPs including his half brother; Future Blademaster,  Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light and hottest guy in the Westlands Galadedrid Damodred

(iii) Lord Agelmar's recounting of al'Lan Mandragoran's personal history and the Tale of Padan Fain

(iv) The Creator(?)  speaking and Rand's Destruction of the Trolloc hordes at Tarwhin's Gap

**Wavering shadows to the east slowly resolved themselves into a horse and rider followed up the road by tall, bulky shapes trotting to keep up with the animal. The pale light of the moon glittered from spearheads and axe blades. Rand never even considered that they might be villagers coming to help.**

 **He knew what they were. He could feel it, like grit scraping his bones, even before they drew close enough for moonlight to reveal the hooded cloak swathing the horseman, a cloak that hung undisturbed by the wind. All of the shapes appeared black in the night, and the horse’s hooves made the same sounds that any other’s would, but Rand knew this horse from any other.**

Here we are shown our first sign that Rand can channel because he can sense the presence of shadowspawn.

**In his mind he pictured Emond’s Field, shutters thrown back and the houses lit for Winternight, people shouting greetings as they passed back and forth on their visits, fiddles filling the streets with “Jaem’s Folly” and “Heron on the Wing.”**

**Haral Luhhan would have one too many brandies and start singing “The Wind in the Barley” in a voice like a bullfrog—he always did—until his wife managed to shush him, and Cenn Buie would decide to prove he could still dance as well as ever, and Mat would have something planned that would not quite happen the way he intended, and everybody would know he was responsible even if no one could prove it. He could almost smile thinking about how it would be.**

I am so sorry Rand that you are having a truly awful day but unfortunately  not only is it not going to get any better you'd be horrified to know that the next two years will be more terriblethan you could ever imagine.

**“Avendesora. It’s said it makes no seed, but they brought a cutting to Cairhien, a sapling. A royal gift of wonder for the king.” Though he sounded angry, he was barely loud enough for Rand to understand. Anyone who could hear him would be able to hear the litter scraping across the ground, too. Rand kept on, only half listening. “They never make peace. Never. But they brought a sapling, as a sign of peace. Five hundred years it grew. Five hundred years of peace with those who make no peace with strangers. Why did he cut it down? Why? Blood was the price for Avendoraldera. Blood the price for Laman’s pride.”**

Fuck that bastard Laman for cutting down Avondoraldera to make his thrice damned throne and whatever happened to it anyway?  I hope the Aiel recovered it and whatever was left of that chora tree. The only reason Cairhien prospered so well is that the Aiel felt that they owed the Cairhienin for their ancestors giving water and shelter to the Aiel Post-Breaking,

**Only that morning he might have felt foolish at musing over the Green Man and the Tree of Life. They were only stories. Are they? Trollocs were just stories this morning. Maybe all the stories were as real as the news the peddlers and merchants brought all the gleeman’s tales and all the stories told at night in front of the fireplace. Next he might actually meet the Green Man, or an Ogier giant, or a wild, black-veiled Aielman.**

You, Rand are half Aiel and so you've already got that covered and not only will you meet a Green Man (Nym) and an Ogier in less than two months but that Ogier will become one of your best and truest friends.


**Tam was talking again, he realized, sometimes only murmuring, sometimes loud enough to understand. From time to time he stopped to pant for breath, then went on as if he thought he had been speaking the whole time.
“. . . battles are always hot, even in the snow. Sweat heat. Blood heat. Only death is cool. Slope of the mountain . . . only place didn’t stink of death. Had to get away from smell of it . . . sight of it. . . . heard a baby cry. Their women fight alongside the men, sometimes, but why they had let her come, I don’t . . . gave birth there alone, before she died of her wounds. . . . covered the child with her cloak, but the wind . . . blown the cloak away. . . . child, blue with the cold. Should have been dead, too. . . . crying there. Crying in the snow. I couldn’t just leave a child. . . . no children of our own. . . . always knew you wanted children. I knew you’d take it to your heart, Kari. Yes, lass. Rand is a good name. A good name.**

As was Prophesized the Dragon was Reborn on the slopes of Dragonmount
born of an ancient blood by a maiden wedded to no man and it was all thanks to that meddler Gitara Moroso ( who I have just realized was a Blue). Which funnily enough makes Ishamael's claim true that Rand's the result of an Aes Sedai breeding scheme.

 **But he could not stop the echo in the back of his mind. He’s my father. It was just a fever-dream. He’s my father. It was just a fever-dream. Light, who am I?**

You'll find out that you are the Dragon Reborn;the champion of the Light in the battle against the Dark One, the prophesied savior and breaker of the world, and the reincarnated soul of Lews Therin Telamon. Also you happen  to be a few other minor things:
(i) The Aiel's Car'a'carn and He Who Comes with the Dawn
(ii) The Atha'an Miere's Coramoor.
(iii) The wolves' Shadowkiller
(iv) Also the Lord of the Morning, Prince of the Dawn, and True Defender of the Light.

Just finished tCG (no spoilers) Started GotM in May, got addicted and obsessed. I read a book every 1.5 weeks, this series has taken over my entire summer. At the beginning I was confused and came to this subreddit and a similar post (can't remember which) had a comment which basically said "Don't google anything, there will be spoilers. Just keep reading and things become explained." I took it to heart and I managed to read the whole series without any googling or anything being spoiled.

This is the best fantasy series (maybe any series) I have ever read, better than asoiaf, WoT, Brandon Sanderson, or Rothfuss. I loved every second of it, and the ending was so amazing. My heart was pumping the whole time. I have spent the last bit reading some theories and explanations on this subreddit and I already feel the need for a re-read (in a few years; my girlfriend might kill me if I bury myself in this again).

I just wanted to gush with some fellow readers, I have yet to talk to anyone who has even heard of this series. If anyone is reading this and considering picking up GotM, just do it and don't google anything.

Spoiler-free "things you might have missed" for each book? I recently started reading WoT and I'm about to finish the second book. I wonder if there's any good list of little details, cool foreshadowing, non-obvious connections etc for each book, that don't spoil things from any future book? When I try to google it, I only seem to find stuff for the entire series.

I get the impression that there's a lot of stuff going on that you'd miss on a first read, but with the sheer size of this series, I don't think I'll go back for a reread any time soon.

[Possible Spoilers All]Any MTG Fans willing to join in a custom WoT/MTG Combo Project? [After seeing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/swtg/), I've decided to work on my own themed set, from the top down, based on my (second) favorite book series: The Wheel of Time. [This is the first test card, because I found Moiraine to be the easiest to design first.](https://imgur.com/RbhD29g)

I'm in the early planning stages, but my goal is to have a faction for each of the ten three color pairings, and a mechanic that each faction shares with at least one other. Channeling will be a mechanic that each faction has, because it's everywhere. (Except Ogier).

Currently, my ideas are:

Jeskai - Aes Sedai

Mardu - Asha'man

Naya - Wolf Brothers

Temur - Borderlanders

Sultai - Darkfriends

Jund - Trollocs, Fades, and Creatures of the Shadow.

Grixis - The Forsaken and the Dark One

Bant - Ogier and Two Rivers Folk

Esper - Seanchan

Abzan - Aiel

I'm open to ideas, formatting or even help if anyone is interested!

The Great Hunt, finished reading for the first time (Spoilers TGH) I finished Book 2 for the first time so here are my thoughts!

The beginning of the book got me super excited! Amyrlin arriving, Rand panicking, I thought he would actually escape and his storyline in this book would be about him trying to evade Aes Sedai, but thankfully not! Completely unexpected attack on Fal Dara happened and I was shocked! The dark prophecy was interesting (although I don't really like prophecies) and I was happy Rand finally learnt he's Dragon Reborn. Even though he rejected it... and the Aes Sedai said it's fine... that was kinda weird, but I guess they couldn't really for him could they? The wheel weaves as the wheel wills (I've started to use this phrase in everyday conversations after getting into WoT).

The hunt after Fain was great as well! I felt a sense of rush in those chapters and scenes like finding a dead myrddraal nailed on a door were especially interesting. Fain became a very intriguing character for me in general and I like his grudge against Rand.

I actually didn't really like the portal stones and Cairhien stuff. The portal stones dont really fit WoT world for me (maybe they will later) and it felt like another way for Jordan to teleport his character across the continent quickly, which he did! Although it's probably better than using the Paths again, cause they are supposed to be dangerous so using them every book would contradict that. Anyway, in the "portal world" we meet Selene and from the moment Rand met her I knew its actually Lanfear. It still isn't 100% confirmed for me, but c'mon, it's super obvious. The Cairhien part was not very interesting for me, the story slowed down a lot here, but I liked how different Cairhien is from other cities I've seen so far, with their daes' daemar and stuff.

But Tom is alive! I actually expected that but that's fine. He got a girl and a nice business and that's great, but then it all goes to crap. I was so sad when he found his girl dead! At first I didn't even realise it and then I had to reread those sentences a couple of times and I didn't want to believe it! Suddenly Tom became much more interesting for me and him killing the assassins was cool af! Looking forward to seeing him more.

Egwain and Nyneave's plot in Tar Valon was fine. Nyneave becoming Accepted was one of my favourite chapters of the book. But then again, when Liandrin came to tell our girls she needs them to help Rand, I knew she was going to betray them. Also, her being a black ajah was obvious for me from the beginning as well. Was it supposed to be that way or is Jordan really bad at these things? It's not explicitely said she is black, but everything points there.

Seanchan. Oh I loved the Seanchan plotline! I was fascinated by their culture, their animals and the sul'dam/damane relationship. So far this book was about Fain stealing the Horn, but then the Seanchan appeared out of nowhere and became the book's primary villains! Awesome! And Fain even joined them and gave them the Horn!

When everyone arrived at Falme I was having the time of my life. Nyneave's team saving Egwain was epic, Rand's team getting the Horn and the dagger was epic and I loved Rand versus Turak fight! And Ingtar was a darkfriend? This stunned me! I did not expect it at all and his story is so sad! He just wanted to protect his people, but then he realised his sins and wanted to cleanse himself by finding the Horn! Poor guy.

As our boys made their escape, they got surrounded by Seanchan and Children of Light. And Mat blew the Horn. And the dead heroes came back to life with King Arthur leading them. And they all rode to battle with the Dragon banner weaving over them. I got goosebumps from all that epicness, definitely my favourite chapter of the series so far!

That's about everything about this book I wanted to tell you. I actually liked Book 2 even more than Book 1, so I'm looking forward to Book 3 and all the other books!

PS: Yet again I'm confused about the [book cover] (https://www.knihcentrum.cz/velke-hledani) of my edition. Is that supposed to be a Seanchan soldier? What do you think?

[M:TFE] Just finished The Final Empire, starting The Well of Ascension, here are some crackpot theories and miscellaneous thoughts What a terrific book! It was my second non-WOT Sanderson - I started with Elantris - and I had to go out and buy *The Well of Ascension* and *The Hero of Ages* as soon as I finished. Just wish I'd bought them earlier.

So, here are some of my theories and thoughts. Please no spoilers past the end of *The Final Empire*

* I'm surprised that Vin's earring didn't play a part in taking down the Lord Ruler. With as often as it was mentioned in the narration, I figure it has to take a major part in some sort of climactic event at some point. My guess is that it'll all go down in *The Hero of Ages*.

* In that same vein, I don't think that Vin is going to eat her earring. I think she's also a Feruchemist, and that she is either going to store something in it or she has been storing something in it all along without knowing, and she'll bust it out at the last minute. Possibly some kind of memory from very young age?

* Also, she has to be a feruchemist too, right? Or something along those lines? The Lord Ruler had all sorts of enhanced abilities that only Vin seems to also have (piercing copperclouds, pulling or pushing metals within others' bodies) so there has to be some kind of similarity there.

* Hi Hoid, I remember you from Elantris, glad to see that you're well. I hope you pop up again in Era 1, maybe disguised? People say that you like to hide.

* Rip Kelsier, I had expected him to live longer considering how often he comes up in threads about awesome Sanderson characters but I guess dying with an entire religion being founded about you is a pretty memorable thing. I did also wonder at first if he was somehow still alive but once OreSur ate him... I would be surprised. Even so, I kind of wondered at first (in WoA) if he was actually the watcher...

* Are Mistwraiths / Kandra the living investiture of Scadrial? Like the Seons from Elantris or the Spren from Stormlight (I read a little of tWoK once)? They seem ephemeral and... weird enough. Or is there not any living investiture because the shards haven't splintered? I am a super newbie to Cosmere lore so please forgive me if I am spouting nonsense.

* I wonder what Gold's alloy does. Presumably it shows you your own past? That doesn't really seem very useful.

* Spook fascinates me way more than he should. Marsh fascinates me exactly as much as he should.

Wild excited about having five more books to read set on Scadrial (and Secret History!)

[SPOILERS] My (somewhat lengthy) impression Of the First Three Malazan Books! HEAVY SPOILERS for the first three Malazan novels, GOTM, DHG and MoI. You have been warned.


This post is basically a story of my journey across these epic books and my friends are too busy to read this these days so here I am posting my first reddit post because I just had to share my experience. Please bear me, sorry.

I had been looking to read some REALLY EPIC fantasy books as i had no more good fantasy games to play anymore :D Hence I decided to resume my love for reading starting with a really good fantasy novel. I searched and apart from the ones I had already like LOTR, Narnia, HP, etc. I found WoT, Mistborn, The Stormlight archive etc... What i wanted to read like i stated was something that stands out the best among the many Epic novels... Read the first few chapters of GOTM, found it really interesting and intriguing, so decided to stick with it. Now on to my actual impressions:

\- Gardens of the Moon (GOTM) was said to be really hard to get into and a difficult read but TBH, I personally didn't face any problem. The only nitpicks I have with SE weren't that off putting despite them being persistent all three books ( will mention them later). GOTM is not the most exceptional or amazing book I have read but I really liked it, it kept me interested, the characters of Paran and Lorn were one of my favs and since they come into play really early on, I liked reading about them onwards. The end I felt was just OK at best... actually, the whole Daruhjhistan and fete arc was my least liked part, along with many of the characters encountered there (except Kruppe of course). I was excited to see how it will all end, and while it being anticlimactic as well as the deus ex machina ending, it was satisfactory nonetheless. But most of all, it made me want to continue which I did.

\-Deadhouse Gates (DG) was superrrrbbb!!! Its was obviously a step up from GOTM in every way, from a writing point of view to a narrative point. It starts VERY strongly, gets boring in the middle from ch 6-14, then comes ch 15 and 16 and I am amazed at the bromance, friendship and characters of both Icarium and Mappo. It just picks up even more from there on and the whole chain of dogs was... WAOW! Amazing! Then comes ch 21, with Coltaine's fall, and i was heartbroken... and almost ready to cry... and Im a 25 year old guy :'D Not to mention that really amazing (somewhat unnecessary subjectively) epilogue. The only thing I didnt like was (you guessed it) the whole Felisin arc. I liked Felisin as a character and her development was done really good... But when you had amazing things like the Icarium arc, Kalams mission (yes i liked it alot), and the amazing chain of dogs arc, it just felt underwhelming, especially how its just a setup for the fourth book; necessary but OK at best. I can go on and on about the Icarium and chain of dogs part of the novel but i think its enough :P

Okay so before I move on to the last one, here's my only criticism of SE: I feel like his writing sometimes breaks the flow. He gets toooo much into the descriptive, psychological and philosophical aspects that it totally breaks my immersion and flow, so much that it gets boring and a drag for me to read. I'm like he wrote ALLLL that just for this... while I do get it might be appealing to some but seriously, sentences like: "they came in the tent, WJ saw the Jug of wine, took it, pour the wine in the two glasses, put them down and sat while stretching his legs which made the chair creek, finally taking a sip from his glass and waited for Dujek to respond"... seriously???? For me, a comprehensive sentence would give the same image as this one while not boring me... and that's my only complain, which is purely subjective.

\-Memories of Ice (MoI): Oh boy... where do I begin... NOW I get why its considered the best in the series (general consensus). This was the most consistently and strongly written of the three. It had no boring moment, no dragged out parts. I loved everything about it. Again, like all three novels i read, it had an amazing and strong start, the only book to have an even better middle, and again, the best ending. I'll probably be writing a new post for my impression of this book but yeah, this is exactly what I was looking for when I started this series.

SE is an amazing writer. His one on one as well as epic battle sequences are some of the best ones I've read since LOTR (granted I haven't read many fantasy). His weaving of epochs, creation of legends, character development, are some of the best I have ever read. But mannnn reading them is mentally exhausting :D Nonetheless, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed it.

I'm reading WoT and I have a question: So I've started reading the book and rn I'm at Lord of Chaos and it's getting really boring by now. I'm in the middle in the book but the previous one was really slow and nothing much happened so I'm afraid that this is how it will go. Just meaningless conversations and dress descriptions with minor story telling? I really enjoyed the first 3 or 4 books!! I will finish the series either way I'm just curious. NO SPOILER PLS!!!

TL;DR: Will the ending be satisfying? Will it get faster paced and more interesting?

Reading WoT for the first time and currently about 3/4 through Great Hunt... I just need to take a pause and rant and rave about how insanely epic and horrifying the Seanchan are. I just got to the part where Domon was overtaken by a Seanchan ship and taken into Falme.

It’s just so insanely cool how this was set up..the whole book I’ve been hearing about rumors of war in the west and Fain saying creepy stuff about meeting Rand on Toman Head. And I’ve been dying to know what’s going on. And then we get the nasty Children of the Light talking about how weird these Seanchan are and then that introduction to them with the ship chase. I mean. These guys are bad news.

I know you all know this, and this is probably a waste of my and your time, but I have no one to talk to about this and I’m excited and wanted to gush! Lol! Now back to reading and avoiding this sub!

Some thoughts on the Blade Itself [Minor Spoilers] I am a fantasy veteran, but have never found the time to read this series... Until now. I am loving it a lot more than I expected to, and particularly enjoy the coming together of cultures and how the different characters react.

In Brandon Sandersons lectures , as well as writing excuses, he mentions a scene in the WoT where a character views a glass of water being left out as shocking, as an ideal way of illustrating cultural differences without telling.

I am loving Logan's reaction to Adua, and Jezal's reaction to Logan. It really puts things into a new perspective, and makes the entire world feel far more real. I knew such things were effective, this is great. I cannot wait to read more of Abercrombie's writing.

Why do people think this series is so great? This is not hate, just genuine interest.

I have read a lot of fantasy over the years and I can get really invested in series (ASOIAF, WOT, SA). However this did not happen at all with this one. I am trying though, please help me.

Thoughts:
I don’t like the prologue technique, the interludes add nothing. The magic system tries to be scientific but in the end talent still dominates. Kvothe is superior to anything and anyone despite being inexperienced, young and unschooled.

Where is the overarching story? Is it the Chandrian? Is there any world politics? A big bad?

Many of these feelings probably come from me preferring epic fantasy though, but I just miss the excitement.

Please don’t take this post the wrong way.

Meaty Epic Fantasy I've been reading a lot of one off books lately and I'm looking to dive into something with a bit more depth too it.  I love fantasy with a lot of world building but am not completey opposed to some sci-fi.  I would like something along the lines of the Wheel of Time series, for comparison.  I've read LotR, Sword of Truth, GoT, Harry Potter, and The Witcher.

This next part I am not entirely sure how to clearly describe.  I LOVE structured groups in books.  For example, I am fascinated by the Aes Sedai in WoT and how they are divided by color, with each color having a different primary focus.  Another example would be Avatar, with each nation having control of a different element.  Or even Harry Potter with each house having it's own sort of identity/personality.

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 7 of the Eye of the World Apologies for the lateness and the possible decreased quality of this post but I've been a bit sick and still a little but I wanted to release another chapter to make sure you don't forget about me.





**Suddenly a house became visible through the last bare-branched trees, and it was all he could do to keep his feet moving. Hope turning to sharp despair, he staggered into the village.**


**Charred piles of rubble stood in the places of half the houses of Emond’s Field. Soot-coated brick chimneys thrust like dirty fingers from heaps of blackened timbers. Thin wisps of smoke still rose from the ruins. Grimy-faced villagers, some yet in their night clothes, poked through the ashes, here pulling free a cookpot, there simply prodding forlornly at the wreckage with a stick.**

Here all this time you've been hoping to find a place of safety in Emond's Field but now you're realizing that nowhere might be safe and while it's such a bitter pill to swallow it's best to learn that lesson now when the stakes are so low in comparison.

**Rand was too tired, too stunned, to speak. All through the night Emond’s Field had been a haven, where he and Tam would be safe. Now all he could seem to do was stare in dismay at her smoke-stained dress. He noticed odd details as if they were very important.**

Take a breath and try to keep calm because you're in shock, Rand and no one can blame you after what you've gone through tonight especially when you've been living in such a peaceful idyllic place as the Two Rivers.


**Briefly he wondered how Master Luhhan knew the creatures were Trollocs, but it was a fleeting thought.**

You'll find out in a bit that there are three people in the village who already knew all about Trollocs.

. **“There’s work waiting for me. Don’t you worry, lad. The Wisdom will take good care of him, and the Light will take care of us all. And if the Light doesn’t, well, we’ll just take care of ourselves. Remember, we’re Two Rivers folk.”**

**Still on his knees, Rand looked at the village as the blacksmith walked away, really looked for the first time. Master Luhhan was right, he thought, and was surprised that he was not surprised by what he saw. People still dug in the ruins of their homes, but even in the short time he had been there more of them had begun to move with a sense of purpose.**

Here's an example of the legendary Two Rivers stubbornness where they'll persevere no matter what.

**Thom Merrilin sat cross-legged on the old foundation stones, carefully snipping singed edges from the patches on his cloak with a pair of small scissors. He set down cloak and scissors when Rand drew near. Without asking if Rand needed or wanted help, he hopped down and picked up the
back of the litter.**

I just fucking love Thom so much; this is the guy who goes out of his way to help and look after people with no expectation of reward . He's the guy who pissed off a Queen for his nephew and protected the Savior of the World before he even  thought he could channel.

Also he never  blamed  Rand and Mat for the Myrddraal laming him or Rand for getting involved in Daes' Daelmar and getting Dena killed .

**“I’m a stranger here,” Thom said, looking longingly at his unlit pipe, “and Goodman Coplin isn’t the only one who wants nothing to do with Aes Sedai. Best the idea came from you.”**

Also he still hates the Red Ajah and dislikes all Aes Sedai because they violated White Tower law and custom by gentling his nephew Owyn and abandoning him in his village .

**“Ko’bal,” he announced. He bounced the badge on his palm and snatched it out of the air with a growl. “That makes seven bands so far.**

I love how the Trolloc band names are all derived from fantasy creatures.

Buying or using the library? What series have you liked enough so that you have decided to purchase them and let them take up (sometimes quite much) space in your book shelf? I don't have any complete series because I generally only buy books from flea markets so I get only what I happen find, but I'm working myself towards the complete WoT set :) David &amp; Leighs Eddings are also pretty easy to find, so I have a number of them too.

testing formatting This is harder than I thought. There is some amazing fan-art out there, but most of it portrays specific events that hasn't occurred for you yet, or iconic outfits/equipment/abilities that the characters haven't acquired yet. In this series even something as basic as the color of someones outfit can have enough significance to be a spoiler. For Perrin, Rand, Mat and Egwene I wasn't able to find anything I liked that didn't have spoilers, hopefully what I link will serve to give you an idea, but I can show you better stuff later on.

I have some more for you, but you can't look at them yet. Some of these are art I came cross while searching that portray events that happen during this book, and that I liked. Others are art of characters you haven't met yet, but that will show up at some point in the book. I'll mark after which chapter each is safe to click. I have one concern with this, in that in choosing to show you some characters and not others I'm drawing attention to them, and thus you'll know that they're probably going to be important later. I hope you're okay with that, but if not, ignore the rest of this. I guess it might even be beneficial to know that some characters are worth paying attention to, considering how many are in this series. That said, there are plenty of people who are worth paying attention that I'm not showing you, if I didn't like the spoiler-free art I found of someone you haven't met yet I didn't bother including them here.

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 8 of the Eye of the World If you've got any comments, questions, or suggestions then feel free to post them with my blessing because one of the reasons I've chosen to undergo this 15 book commentary odyssey was to
re-invigorate  this subreddit.


**The white-haired gleeman cut off a conversation with the Mayor—who was bent over the bed again, tending Tam—and gave Moiraine an uneasy look.**

I think that Thom is attracted to her and yet he's disturbed about the fact that she is an Aes Sedai.

**Lan stared after him, his angular face as expressionless as a rock. “I do not like that man. There is something about him I don’t trust. I did not see a hair of him last night.”**

You don't like him Lan because you know that he isn't quite what he seems and yet you might like him less if you'd  found out that he'd succeed you as Moiraine's Warder.

**Her eyes traveled slowly from Tam’s feet to his head, but Rand had the prickly feeling that she was looking beyond him in some fashion. “You may talk if you wish,” she went on absently**

He (Rand) can feel her touching the One Power for the first time here.

**In the stories Aes Sedai wonders were always accompanied by flashes and thunderclaps, or other signs to indicate mighty works and great powers. The Power. The One Power, drawn from the True Source that drove the Wheel of Time.**

Hmmm. It's ironic that the stories take poetic license with the truth about channeling when for the most part the things channelers do are invisible to the mundanes.

**“That is a fine weapon you wear. Is there by chance a heron on the blade, as well?**

**“I’d not have thought to find a heron-mark sword in a place like this,” Lan said.**

**“It belongs to my father.” He glanced at Lan’s sword, the hilt just visible at the edge of his cloak; the two swords did look a good deal alike, except that no herons showed on the Warder’s.**

Here's classic  al'Lan Mandragoran, look at him trying to occupy Rand but at the same time remain on task discovering potential useful information.


**“There are places where the heron is a symbol of the master swordsman. That blade must have traveled a strange road to end up with a sheepherder in the Two Rivers.”**

Dammit and here I'm yet again craving the prequel and sequel  novels so fucking badly that I can practically taste them.

**“The Mayor said the only reason there’s anything left of the village is because of you and her.” He made himself look at the Warder. “If you had been told about a man in the woods . . . a man who made people afraid just by looking at them . . . would that have warned you? A man whose horse doesn’t make any noise? And the wind doesn’t touch his cloak? Would you have known what was going to happen? Could you and Moiraine Sedai have stopped it if you’d known about him?”**

The Myrddraal remain one of my favorite dark races of all time and in my opinion they're still awesome even if they're no longer such a threat.

**“Not without half a dozen of my sisters,” Moiraine said, and Rand started. She still knelt by the bed, but she had taken her hands from Tam and half turned to face the two of them on the bench. Her voice never raised, but her eyes pinned Rand to the wall. “Had I known when I left Tar Valon that I would find Trollocs and Myrddraal here, I would have brought half a dozen of them, a dozen, if I had to drag them by the scruffs of their necks. By myself, a month’s warning would have made little difference. Perhaps none. There is only so much one person can do, even calling on the One Power, and there were probably well over a hundred Trollocs scattered around this district last night. An entire fist.”.**


I'm sorry but I keep on forgetting how weak most channelers are in comparison to full powered Jesus Rand especially when it would take 6 other Aes Sedai alongside Moiraine beat a single fist of Trollocs and yet Rand could default 5000 fists in a single battle by himself.

Also do you remember when the five Fists on the road to Shadar Logoth were so fucking worrying the first time you read the Eye of thie World ?

**Moiraine shook her head and sighed. “Not yet. I hope it is only not yet. Trolloc weapons are made at forges in the valley called Thakan’dar, on the very slopes of Shayol Ghul itself. Some of them take a taint from that place, a stain of evil in the metal. Those tainted blades make wounds that will not heal unaided, or cause deadly fevers, strange sicknesses that medicines cannot touch. I have soothed your father’s pain, but the mark, the taint, is still in him. Left alone, it will grow again, and consume him.”**

I love these homages to J.R.R Tolkien and how in my oh so humble opinion Roberrt Jordan keeps one-upping him.

Shire &lt; Two Rivers

Orodruin&lt; Dragonmount

Gondor &lt; Borderlands

Morgul Blade &lt; Thakan'dar Blade

Orc &lt; Trolloc

Ent &lt; Ogier

Orthanc &lt; Tower of Ghenjei

Wormtongue &lt; Fain/Mordeth

Moria &lt; Shadar Logoth

**“In the Age of Legends,” Moiraine went on, “some Aes Sedai could fan life and health to flame if only the smallest spark remained. Those days are gone, though—perhaps forever. So much was lost; not just the making of angreal. So much that could be done which we dare not even dream of, if we remember it at all. There are far fewer of us now. Some talents are all but gone, and many that remain seem weaker."**


I hate this trope in Science Fiction and Fantasy because of how common it's become  that  the world whatever it is is failing and fading and their best daya are behind them.

**“Leave!” he exclaimed, scrambling to his feet. “Is it really that bad? Everyone looked to me as if they were ready to start rebuilding. We are pretty settled folk in the Two Rivers. Nobody ever leaves.”**

That's true for the most part except for the few outliers like Tam, the Two Rivers folk are bound to their homeland by the blood of their fallen ancestors .

**“Me?” He cleared his throat and tried again. “Me?” It sounded a little better this time. “Why do I have to go? I don’t understand any of this. I don’t want to go anywhere.”**

**Rand looked at Moiraine, leaning back in the chair, but she said nothing, only watched him, a finger laid across her lips. “Our farm, and who else’s?” he asked finally.**

**“The Aybara farm,” Lan replied. “Here in Emond’s Field, they struck first at the forge, and the blacksmith’s house, and Master Cauthon’s house.”
Rand’s mouth was suddenly dry. “That’s crazy,” he managed to get out, then jumped as Moiraine straightened.**

**“Not crazy, Rand,” she said. “Purposeful. The Trollocs did not come to Emond’s Field by happenstance, and they did not do what they did for the pleasure of killing and burning, however much that delighted them. They knew what, or rather who, they were after. The Trollocs came to kill or capture young men of a certain age who live near Emond’s Field.**

Look I love the Wheel of Time series and Rand al'Thor is my favorite character of all time in all mediums (tv, movies, books, games, etc.) but Rand was so reluctant in the beginning.

First about leaving the Two Rivers and then about being the Dragon Reborn until he got unequivocal proof by pulling the Sword from the Stone and then he became a fucking bulldozer charging towards Tarmon Gai'don

But even though he wasn't sure he still declared himself to be the Dragon Reborn  because like Lan he adopted as one of mottoes  the quote," Death is lighter than a feather, but Duty is heavier than a mountain."

**Rand shifted uneasily, wishing she would not look at him like that, as if her eyes could pierce his brain and read what lay in every corner of it. “What would they want with us? We’re just farmers, shepherds.**

Two things wrong with what you're saying Rand, and the first is that you're an Aiel/Andoran hybrid and second  is that the the others are heirs to the lost Nation of Manetheren.

**A journey all the way to Tar Valon was almost beyond thinking. A journey to a place where he would be surrounded by Aes Sedai. Of course, Moiraine had healed Tam—or it looked as if she had, at least—but there were all those stories. It was uncomfortable enough to be in a room with one Aes Sedai, but to be in a city full of them. . . . And she still had not demanded her price. There was always a price, so the stories said**

I don't blame Rand at all for not trusting Moiraine and the first time I read the books I distrusted her until she vanished in the doorway in the Fires of Heaven

 Also there's the fact that Moiraine is the best of the Aes Sedai because she spent so much time outside of that Black Ajah infected shithole known as Tar Valon and I shudder to imagine he'd gone there  before Verin outted the Black Ajah because he'd dead, gentled or Thirteen by Thirteened for sure.

Book recommendations before I read WoT I've seen a lot of people looking for books to read after WoT because they feel that other books can't compare. I also vaguely remember someone else in a comment mentioning that WoT was like an end goal for the genre. So I'm looking for recommendations before I read the series.

Here's some other info that may or may not be helpful. I will be a high school senior this year, and during the year we will be reading The Hobbit. I'm thinking that it would make sense to read (restart and actually finish) the rest of the Lord of the Rings series once I graduate. People say Robert Jordan was influenced by Tolkien so I think that would be a good idea. I also have the Mistborn series on my shelf, and want to read that at some point. I read the first two and a half of the WoT books a few years ago, so I know that this is a series I want to read, I just want to restart and read them all without interruption. I think my question is different from other similar ones in the sense that the suggestions don't have to be "as good" as WoT. I'm looking for ones you wished you had read before it, so they don't feel underwhelming when you read them. Thanks.

Ideas for next series Hey there redditors,

Wanted your input on the next series I should get into next. On the epic/sprawling platform I’ve read ASoIaF, The Dark Tower and im about halfway through Malazan BoTF. I love all three series, apart from the ending of The Tower for very different reasons. Song of Ice and Fire for its characters, lack of any mercy. dark tower for the mystery, the journey. Malazan for its scope and depth, number of characters.

Should I go WoT, Stormlight or something else based on what you gather about what Im into so far. Thanks a ton in advance.

Starting to reread from book 1... I'v read the WoT a long time ago, when I was still in school. It was before Sanderson finished last three books. I also read them in Russian, so I had to wait for the translation. Eventually, I forgot the details. I attempted to reread a couple of times, every time got distracted on book 3 or 4. And then couldn't continue, because, of course, I forgot where I was. It's like trying to play an epic RPG game from an old save game. Impossible. So now I finally convinced myself to start over. I considered reading short plot descriptions and then just read the last few books, but I am a completionist. So I just got a Kindle version of The Eye of the World, original English version.
Wish me luck and will to see this through till the end! I really hope I can make it this time. I love this series, but it's just so slow sometimes... It makes it even more difficult to reread.

Who are your favorite side antagonists in fantasy. I was spacing out today and thinking a lot about Padan Fain, a lot about how evil/vile he was but at the same time he was a fantastic antagonist and a wonderful addition to WoT.  And then I realized he wasn't even the main antagonist in the series and it got me wondering.  What are your favorite side antagonist in fantasy?

I've just started the WoT, and I have a couple of quick questions. I have just finished *The Dragon Reborn*, and thus far I am in love with the series. My questions are primarily about, "The Slog." Does it exist? If so, which books does it pertain to? Anyone I have ever talked to has said this about the series: "The middle gets slow but the ending is worth it." I am going to finish it regardless. This is just a mere curiosity. Thank you all for your time!

Unexpected WoT - TIL that one chapter of Memory of Light, the last book in the Wheel of Time series, contained 81,200 words. By comparison, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was about 78,000 words in its entirety.

Alternate writing of the WoT idea I know it's never going to happen, but I would very much have liked to read an additional WoT that is written from the POV of the Forsaken, centered around Elan / Ishamael / Moridin

I don't know how many of you are familiar with the Recluse saga. One of the more interesting things about it is that it depicts a conflict between order wizards and chaos wizards, and every book highlights a different POV on the historical timeline.

One conflict in particular has 2 books dedicated to it, with a main protagonist from a different side in each book. And in both books, you get the sense that that side is the good side and the other side is bad.

I find the Forsaken interesting characters. And by the time we start reading, they are who they are, but they didn't start out that way. And especially with Elan figuring out that he is doomed to be eternally the champion of dark, that descent into darkness must be interesting in and of itself.

And for the rest too. Nobidy wakes up one day and says to themselves: 'you know, being good isn't all that. let's be evil and slaughter a thousand children'. Each of the forsaken must have had their road into darkness.

And even in the books that we see, thankfully there are POV chapters for all of them, but they are the minority, and for most of the time we don't know what they are doing.

So, as I said I know it'll never happen, but WoT written mainly from the Forsaken point of view, starting with them at a time before the bore, that would imo be a riveting read!

Switching to the audiobooks--should I start over? So, I recently got into audiobooks thanks to the fantastic audio versions of Jim Butcher's *The Dresden Files* read by James Marsters (seriously, check them out) and now I want to read through the rest of *The Wheel of Time* in the same manner. I feel like I have an easier time visualizing the story in my head with the narration, and I also seem to pick up on more details than I normally would when I'm reading the text myself. (That might seem backwards to some people, but for some reason it works for me.)

Anyway, my concern is that I've already read the first four books of the series, but it's been about two years since I finished *The Shadow Rising.* I went on a bit of a binge in the summer of 2016 and blew through those first four novels, but after that I felt myself starting to get a little burned out and decided to take a break (I'd had issues with starting/stopping WoT before, so I was afraid it was going to happen again).

Now I'm finally ready to dive into *The Fires of Heaven,* but I really want to listen to the audiobook instead. I feel like it might help me with my fear of burnout. I still remember the general storylines that occurred in the previous four novels, it's just some of the small details I can't really recall anymore. Do you folks think it'd be worth my time to go back and start over with the audiobook version of *The Eye of the World*? I'm strongly considering doing so, but I also worry that I'd face the burnout issue again, as this would be my third time restarting the series without finishing it. But I also feel like it'd be kind of awkward switching from the text versions to the audiobooks midstream...

[Spoilers KoD] So I’ve been reading The Belgariad by David Eddings and had a WoT moment.. In the fourth book of The Belgariad, a queen sets out to rouse some knights to aid her husband. She gives a fiery speech and convinces the men to follow her. I had to stop reading because I couldn’t get Lans march across the borderlands out of my head.

The last few pages of chapter 20 in Knife of Dreams are some of the most powerful words I’ve ever read. I had to go back and read the chapter.

“My name is Nynaeve ti al’Meara Mandragoran. The message I want sent is this. My husband rides from Worlds End toward Tarwin’s Gap, toward Tarmon Gai’don. Will he ride alone?”

I’ve been reading a lot of fantasy this year. Many are great, some are epic in scale, but there’s nothing quite like the WoT. It’s truly beautiful.

Hey everyone, I've been stuck in a bit of a limbo over the past month not knowing what to read that's new, and since I'll be going back to college soon it'd be nice to have a new series to dig into during breaks. I've read all the stuff you'd expect, LOTR, ASOIAF, WoT, Mistborn, SLA, Witcher, Lightbringer, Gentlemen Bastards, First Law etc. etc. I wouldn't mind another grimdark, similar to ASOIAF and First Law, but I'm not picky.

[Spoilers all] ToM ending Hey everyone. About half an hour ago I finished the 13th book in WoT and I’m still reeling from it. I’ve been reading this wonderful series for the past five years. However, I may just be missing a huge amount of info but im feeling confused with the ending. They built up the final battle for most of the series and when it came to it they gave us segments of different characters. Like Perrin in the wolf dream, Rand in the dark room with lanfear I believe? And Lan leading his army against the Trollocs.

So I’m feeling mighty confused, sad, happy and many more things. Have I missed anything in these books I need to re read to understand?

[Spoilers] in the body talking about Mistborn 1 and 2. Looking for a new series. Very new fantasy reader. I loved Wheel of Time and ASoiaF, liked LotR, and tried 2 books from Mistborn but seriously just can’t get in to it. I listen to audiobooks on the way to and from work on double speed. I sort of chug these things. Finished my fourth listen-through of WoT last week and gave Sanderson’s own series a shot, but I just can’t do it.

Final Empire didn’t do it for me, but I didn’t get super into WoT until book 2 or 3, so I thought I’d give Well of Ascension a try. Maybe Mistborn isn’t “high” enough of fantasy for my taste? Aside from not finding the characters very compelling, I find Allomancy clunky and boring. To me, terms like “coinshots,” “thugs,” “tin-eye” to be too...mundane? Gosh I sound like a douche. I think the biggest detractor for me is the lack of rising action. I found myself unknowingly 3/4ths of the way through Well of Ascension when I found myself thinking “oh cool the story is starting.” No, it was finishing. I felt like I was just sort of along for the ride, with no clear goal or intention throughout both book’s entirety.

I’ll just lastly say that this is of course all my personal taste. There are things about Mistborn that I have appreciated, but I guess my tastes just don’t align with the series. I would love any recommendations you have! Hopefully some have audiobooks, but I’m not scared to also pick up a book to actually ready too. Thank you all again so much for your time! Have a great day!

Having trouble finishing Wheel of Time.*Spoilers up to book 10* A couple weeks back I started reading WoT and now I’m halfway through book 10 and struggling with wanting to finish. There are a number of reasons why so I’ll just go with what’s off the top of my head:


**I dislike so many characters**
I’m having trouble liking many of these characters. Rand’s head continues to slide further up his own ass as the series goes on. His personality is crap and he makes stupid decisions. I was so happy when the maidens beat his ass. Matt was annoying when he kept whining about running away without ever following through with anything. He’s a least getting better as the series goes on. I like Perrin, but he gets pretty screwed in terms of visibility until recently.

Angry, Snooty, and Self-important Sedai all read like the same character with minor differences. Just flavor with under-breast-arm-folding, men are idiots, he had no right, box his ears, and whatever else they do every other sentence. Oh, and the most unbelievable thing about the series is how Nynaeve doesn’t have traction alopecia by now. A good portion of the women in general come off as really unlikable. They often just brow beat the male characters and are huge hypocrites.

Other interesting characters like Logain and Loial are rarely seen. Everybody keeps ditching Loial which really sucks.


**The POV jumping is getting crazy**
So many characters and it’s so hard to keep track. It used to manly be the main characters and sometimes the side ones but now it’s seemingly nobodies all around the place. You might jump to some guy across the world for a chapter who just ends up dead by the next.


**It feels like it takes forever for anything to happen**
There were times when reading when it felt like I read so much and almost nothing happened. Everything moves so slowly. I thought Traveling would pick up the pace of things a lot but even now things feel like they drag. It’s difficult trying to describe this.


I dunno, maybe I just needed to rant a bit. I just read through part of Faile’s capture and you can totally tell she is gonna bone this Aiel dude. After all the crap Perrin has gone through for her and now this. Ugh, makes my stomach turn.

What are you reading after WOT? And how did WOT shape your reading experience? At least in terms of fantasy genre WOT set high standard for me regarding what to expect from a story. The characters are quite likable and you could relate to them, they have their flaws, but overall are capable and interesting. There is a constant sense of adventure, and the lore was captivating.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried reading Throne of Glass after WOT, and it was awful. I could not bring myself to like the main protagonist, and I did try. This made me realise how easy it was to like most WOT characters from the get go. Although the lore in Throne of Glass sounded interesting, the characters were too dreadful.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I am reading The Ranger's Apprentice, a wonderful story. First thing I noticed is the time scaling. In one book almost a year passed, while in WOT, 2 years passed in 14 books. It is a much smaller series, so there is not as much as world building in WOT, but it still features an exciting and adventurous world.

&amp;#x200B;

I really connected with the characters from WOT and felt close to them, so if I start reading a series and dont feel the connection in the first book at least, I might drop it, like what i did with Throne of Glass.

The last true reread As I am once again rereading the series on the eve of the upcoming show, I realized something. This might be the last read-through where my image of the characters is fully my own. I had the same thing when the Harry Potter movies came out. Try as I might, every time I reread those, Daniel Radcliffe pops into my head as Harry potter, I cannot see Snape as anyone but Alan Rickman (The creator shelter his soul).

&amp;#x200B;

This has really motivated to finish my reread before casting begins. I want this to be my last pure reread. The last time my version of the characters is the image I see when I hear their name. The last time where I can read WoT without thinking "the TV series really messed this up" or maybe even "the TV series did this better".

&amp;#x200B;

Just wistful thoughts of a long time fan I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone agree/disagree ?

First Readthrough I was finishing up reading though Terry Goodkind's "sword of truth" series, I was seriously dragging through the last 3 or 4 book and I wanted to see if some other fans were struggling or if it was just me. So I was trolling through r/SwordOfTruth and some one there happened to mention that WoT was a much better series.

After getting partway through the first 3 books in WoT I can't help but notice similarities between Robert Jordan and Goodkind. I.E. A powerful magic user grows up in an out of the way place and is given a special sword and a dangerous quest by a mysterious woman forcing him to leave home and become a ruler. A group of women who control the training of new magic users. There is a secret group of these women sworn to a dark master. The list seems to go on forever.

As WOT was written before Sword of Truth, did Goodkind steal a lot of his ideas from Jordan or am I just taking a fancy?

Nightmare Fuel in Fantasy Fantasy can be filled with heartwarming, heroic and awesome stuff but it can also be filled with extremely dark stuff.

So what are the most nightmare inducing situations/setups whether it'd be depravities, cruelty, lack of rights, objectification or just general terrifying/horrifying situations/setup in the setting from the fantasy series you've read ?

Some of the worst nightmare fuel situations i've read from fantasy

* Tenescowri Army from Malazan (an army fed through cannibalism of their enemies ? like they are literally fueled by hunger  .. yikes )
* Seachan slavery and the damane from Wheel of Time (They force the damane(aka the special slave) to break her until she eventually actually likes her situation(stolkholm syndrome). People say that WoT is not mature/dark enough but i remember the concept of damanes are written from that series which was the most disturbing kind of slavery i read. )
* The entire setting of DemonCycle series by Peter Brett. Literal demons come at night that you have to hide behind wards ? Check. (book 2 spoilers) &gt;!That thing with the Krasian where they conquered that one of the Fort and they basically kill every male who can't fight or doesn't fit their standards to fight and all the women are who can give birth are turned into their breeding slaves. All that because of their religious dedication to fight against demons. I have no idea further since i haven't finished the book!&lt; . And i suspect that was not the only horrible stuff in that series.
* Hanging Trees from Travelers Gate Trilogy where &gt;!You either sacrifice 10 innocent people per year on the hanging trees where they are tortured by the tree horribly until they die. Or you let out all of the Incarnation which are basically Anthromorphic Personification of ideals that can summon monsters and are mostly unstoppable. Either you subject innocents to horrific death or you possibly subject much much many people to horrific death. There's no middleground.!&lt;
* The Heralds-Desolation situation from Stormlight Archives (The desolations are basically apocalypse where they fight the god of hate's servants with the heralds leading the defense .. and each time the desolation ends the heralds had to go back to a version of hell where the very creatures they fight torture them(and each time they break the desolation begins again). Yep being a herald here is the worst.)

So bring out the worst situations in fantasy you've read !

Just finished The Eye of The World! SPOILERS AHEAD

Hi everyone, so recently i made a post titled "taking the leap, starting WoT" which garnered a lot of support and encouragement, and now since i have finished book 1 i thought i would spill my thoughts.

I really enjoyed it, i liked pretty much all of the characters and found the overall plot to be great. There were definitley some slow parts but i would never describe any part of the book as boring.

Its hard for me to articulate all of the thoughts and feelings  i have regarding the book. While i was reading there were several times i tried to take metal note of things that i wanted to mention here but now that its over and so much has happened i cant keep track of all the things i want to talk about.

I guess i will just talk about my hopes for book 2. I'm really interested to see how the Lan/Nynaeve dynamic continues, i really dont want rand to go off by himself - i hope somehow he ends up staying with the group ( i know, a vain hope). I wanted Rand to go to Tar Valon and bump into Elayne and Gawyn to see what would happen. I expect Perrin will eventually make his way back to the wolf pack and Elyas. Wondering where Thom Merrilyn has ended up and where we will se him next. I really hope the children of the light get destroyed - i hate them so much.

Cant wait to start The Great Hunt, which i will do tonight, thanks for listening to my ramble.

DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR A "CANNOT PUT DOWN" BOOK SERIES. PLEASE AND THANKS!! I'm looking for a new series to read and I'm really struggling. I've read Harry Potter countless times, most of aSoIaF and Outlander...I like the sort of fantasy/romance stuff but its not essential. I just want something that I can get lost in and not be able to put down :) preferably a series- finished or not! I've gone back and forth with farseer trilogy and mistborn...I could never get into WoT and I feel like I am too dumb for Malazan. Ugh. Any feedback would be great!

(Spoilers Powder Mage 1 - 3) Finished First Trilogy - Thoughts and Questions Finished the first trilogy and had some thoughts and questions, in part just to reflect on the series myself, but always enjoy discussion about books to get any differing opinions or pointing out things I missed.

I enjoyed the series, think it's a great example of Gunpowder Fantasy, and feels much less like guns could just be replaced with bows and arrows and the books would be the same than some other examples I've read.

Liked the Privileged magic in/with the Else, nice traditional fantasy, and unsurprisingly it was reminiscent of the One Power from WoT. Pulling threads of different elements and creating waves etc, but that's all gravy, I like WoT and also it wasn't *the* core magic, but I've got some questions regarding both the Else and the Powder Mage powers.

1.	The "gods" hint at just being among the first of the Else-casters (not sure of terminology). But they don’t say that they were from the PM planet, and as they had to be summoned, is this hinting at a far wider universe? I certainly hope so, and have seen hints at it in comment (I think).

2. I functioned on the assumption that the Else was a mystic power that had always been, and without the books going into detail this was easy enough to do, just a magic and magic system, happy days. Even assuming that Ka-Poel’s quasi voodoo magic comes from the else is fine, just about how it’s interacted with.

But Gunpowder Magic (powder magic?) seems so… specific. That exact compound has both beneficial benefits for one subset of magi, but can be negative for others? Can cause strength, speed, but also increased viewing, something crazily specific to being able to shoot well, BUT ALSO giving the ability to ignite said compound, or absorb energy from a blast of said compound and put it into a shot, but also manipulate the bullets, I guess through the remnants of powder on the ball? Through the manipulation of powder energy?

I guess what I’m getting at is…. What gives?

The only analogy I could think of was similar to Sanderson’s [possible spoilers](#s 'concepts of conduits for investiture, like metal in the Mistborn trilogy').

I love magic systems, and I especially love when they’re explained and explored, which in this series the Else gets covered more in terms of explanation of the fundamentals and how it works, and the powder magic just… is.  But it also seems to interact with the existing magic systems; same looking in to the else, can sense other users and other sourcery.

Long rambling question, my apologies.

3. I think Bo at one point says the Predeii were the most powerful casters of their time, and it took 13 of them to summon the "gods", and that, not just being the most powerful of their time, but that the average power level of Privileged was higher too.  He then mentions how powerful Nila will be, and we all know how powerful Ka Poel will be…. Bearing in mind I’m about to read the second trilogy so this may play in to that… Are they basically Predeii? Magic just getting stronger again for some reason?

4. Other than being extra strong without powder, did Taniel’s Powder-Predeii actually do anything? Didn’t seem to increase his ability to shoot or detonate powder etc.  Just made his arm harder to break. And it seemed that most of his protection against Gods was actually Ka-Poel’s spells anyway.

Moving on from the magic systems…

I enjoyed that the scope of the book increased from single battle to possible destruction of at least a country, if not more so. However I did feel that the story lines were somewhat disparate, and that, for example, the last battle vs the Kez just felt like a foregone conclusion and got in the way of the eventual battle with the gods, which then was all over a bit quickly. And through it all, a couple of almost superfluous story lines, like Taniel and Vlora not having talked things through was resolved on a single page with the lines “forgive me?” “only if you forgive me”.
Basically I felt like Tamas and Taniel and Vlora could have sorted a lot more of their shit out. What was sorted out seemed rush, and maybe it was just to keep Tamas as someone that couldn’t communicate well with people he cared about or something, but even at his death I didn’t think Taniel would, in the future, readjust his views of his dad and anger at him for… well, everything. Maybe that’s the point, a bit more realism, like with Niklaus and Ipille being killed effectively offscreen despite everything they did.

I basically can’t decide if I just “liked” the books, or *really* liked them. Partly because of questions and partly felt some things left unresolved that seemed to be really big parts or big character drivers that were ignored much of the time.

That being said… I plan on reading the second series and all the short stories, and don’t feel like I’m doing it just to tick the boxes, so it isn’t like I didn’t enjoy the books and world enough to want more and whatnot.

Bringing me to next set of questions:

5. Should I read the short stories before starting the second series?

6. Other than the blurb for Sins of the Empire, I don’t know anything about the story or characters but it seems like a 10-years older (30something?) Vlora is a main character? Do we hear anything of other characters, even in passing (avoiding any spoilers ofc)? Be some loose ends or just character goings on I’d love to hear about.

7. A lot of the short stories appear to cover escapades for Taniel/Tamas or one of the characters I think is from the second series… are there any that cover the magic more? Or any resources where people go through theories that I can read up on?

If you’ve got this far, thanks for reading, as I said, I like just writing down thoughts and questions after a series, in part to try to pinpoint good bits or areas I’d like clarification on etc.

Happy snorting. (Sounds so wrong…)

(P.S. I think reddit formatting will put the second set of questions as another 1. 2. 3., but they're actually 5. 6. and 7.)

GoTM 5th or 6th read - Spoilers I mix in stuff about all of Malazan

So I just finished my 5th or 6th read of Gardens on the Moon and I want to talk a bit, share some feelings, hate on people and whatnot. There will be major spoilers, as this will be open commentary with no regard to where you are in the series. I have read the full series 3 times and most of the ICE books as well and the other ones by SE. So I will be referencing stuff without a filter, be advised of possible spoilers and lots of rambling.

Back Story:

Like all 20 somethings(this is back in the day) I was an intellectual juggernaut. I bought GOTM because I had just finished the available WOT and Sword of Truth books. Ready for a new challenge I got home and started reading. 50 pages in I liked it but had no fucking clue what was going on. 200 pages I was still intrigued but having concerns that I may be stupid. 400 pages in is about that mark I quit and feeling thoroughly defeated and disappointed I moved on. It was hard to come to grips because I really enjoyed it but I was so confused.

About 5 years later it’s Xmas time. YYAAYYYYYYY!! I open the gift I got from my dad and oddly enough it was DHG &amp; MoI books 2 and 3. I didn’t even clue in until a few weeks later when I was about to read DHG and noticed it was book 2. This must be destiny, now I have to read this series. Back to book 1 and commencing humiliation.

Now, I read the series once every year or 2. Generally whenever a new book comes out I restart the series. Now, to the point. My GoTM thoughts:

1. I thought it was weird at the beginning when it spoke about who were legends of the Bridgeburners it named Detoran, Antsy and Spindle. Detoran is virtually nonexistent and the other 2 are great and have parts in other books but not what I would have used as legendary guys.

2. I hate Crokus, I really hate him. Each time he appears I groan. He gets the same reaction from me as all the crazy radical hippy protesters whining about rights and what not. YUCK + Douche Chills. Teenage angst, he is so pathetic and then to change your name to Cutter. Why not get a lip ring you fuckin loser. The only good thing about him is how much he hates Iskaral Pust. Pust is awesome, in my top 10 of favorites.

3. The Crimson Guard – These guys kind of annoy me in the Malazan world. Great characters and adventures, but I find myself confused as to their power levels. To thoroughly humiliate the Tiste Andii mages seemed a little far fetched to me. Especially with the idea of convergence and power draws power, I don’t see how they could have been ghosts in Darujistan at this point if they are that powerful they would have drawn more attention.

4. Raest is one of my favorite characters. His personality in the future books cracks me up.

5. No hand holding – As I said earlier I struggled to make it through this book in the beginning but I REALLY LIKED IT. Once you start to get the flow and remember more and more of the history and stuff the books get better. I start to notice sentences and comments that foreshadow events and if you read all the poems and whatnot little scraps of history get filled in. This was my 5th or so read and it was amazing.

6. Hedge – Anytime shit goes down I get excited hoping the next scene describes Hedge with a gleam in his eye and a cusser in his hand. Love this guy.

7. Sorry – The one problem I have with the possession of her is that she is a small girl. I don’t care who possesses her there will be major physical limitations. When the rope is not directly involving himself I would think she would be next to useless. I don’t care how skilled she is one block would shatter her little bird bones.

8. Planting mines in Daru – they are pro sappers do you think they would have missed that the city sat on gas caverns? Come on. Could have been upfront with the knowledge that they were ok with blowing up the place then because of friendships and whatnot they had a change of heart.

9. I like the concept and psychology of the immortal idea. I get torn sometimes but I think we have to consider the difference a race or being must have mentally to deal with extended life. By this I mean I highly doubt a human could live 1000 years as we currently are brain wise. Traits that we developed to deal with the world are complex and I think a total different brain chemistry and configuration would be required. I think we see the fallout for this idea in characters like Gothos and Rake, the pathos and depression. Silchas Ruin really slammed home this point to me when he was trapped in the Azath and did not go completely batshit crazy, same with the forkrul assail under the stone.

10. Sometimes I think Quick Ben is Kellanved in disguise. The shifty bastard.

11. Toc – Oh Toc why do we need to be tortured by you. Every section is painful with Toc as it always has a tone of desperation and disaster. Oh man there is something in my eye right now………

Will I like Wheel of Time. I started a brief discussion in another post but decided to make my own.

Wheel of time as been on my ‘maybe’ list for some time now. A few things are stopping me from picking it up.

It’s size PLUS the much talked about slog smack in the middle of the series. I’ve been told here that that is overblown. Fair.

I’m worried it might just be a lord of the rings clone. Predictable. Cliche. Any truth to my fears?
I enjoy books with clues laid out within them. Asoiaf. Malazan. King killer  are my latest fantasy reads.

I’m also thinking of Scott bakkers prince of nothing series.

Can anyone fill me in on the finer points of Wot without giving away plot and building my interest?

Any good maps out there? So I've just started the WoT series (70% of first book). Are there any more high resolution maps online? I only find ones that are so small you can barely read the names.

I really like following the characters on the map. And I have the feeling that it adds very much to this series.

I found out that one of my favorite songs is actually a reference to this book series! Hey there!

I was listening to one of my favorite songs, [The Gleeman by The Dread Crew of Oddwood](https://thedreadcrewofoddwood.bandcamp.com/track/the-gleeman), and decided to do some fanart for it. When I looked up some of the lyrics for specific references, I noticed more and more Wheel of Time stuff appearing. It wasn't very hard to confirm it when comparing the lyrics to the Gleeman WoT wikia page. I have yet to read this series, but as a huge Fantasy book enthusiast, it's been on my to-read list. This bumped it up higher on my list :) (And also confirmed that the Dread Crew boys are huge nerds, though that's obvious enough)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share this here in case anyone one else would like to enjoy this tune (and I'm sure understanding the reference makes it even more enjoyable).

&amp;#x200B;

I was also wondering if anyone could tell me if this is referring to a specific part of the book, or if it's just a made-up scenario (or perhaps something that even happens often?) From what I understand, Gleeman is just an occupation and there's no ONE specific Gleeman. Thanks!!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the lyrics for those that are too lazy to click on my earlier link.

&amp;#x200B;

 In an age yet come­ an age long past
a crowd gathered 'round with eyes all cast
To a man on a stage in a patchwork cloak
with hands like lightning, fire, and smoke


He made fly leather, flame and steel
and plucked at a harp with a heavenly feel
And sang with a voice so moving and strong
that all passers by were entranced In his song


Hold high your drinks to the king of the bards
Roll all your dice and lay down your cards
Drum with your fists on the tables and bars
Sing out your heart as you gaze to the stars


He knuckled his mustaches and produced a black wood flute
And from the gilded silver sprouted reels jigs and tunes
The tavern floor was shaking from the dancing and the booze
And not a man or woman there could ever have refused


Now the gleeman held the throng in the palm of his hand
As he spun tales and songs of old heroes and lands
But any can have secrets­ and not all is what it seems
And the evening was cut short by a demon from a dream


A pale grey thing with an eyeless gaze
Drew from hanging robes a long black blade
He slithered through the crowd yet before he reached the stage
A pair of knives flew into empty sockets on his face

Questions for a podcast episode I have a podcast called The Nerd Book Review. We are going to be recording a WoT episode here shortly and I'd like to get some questions from you all to ask my friend who just recently got done with the series for the first time since they were done. This might get a bit rambly so I apologize ahead of time. The 3 of us who will be on the episode grew up loving the series and by the time we were in college, 2001-5, we were already feeling what Rothfuss and Martin fans are now with the long waits and books that not all of us loved. Back when I had time I would re-read the entire series whenever a new one came out. I think that because of the waits and books where not a lot happened some things may have been blown out of proportion in my mind and now that it has been a while since I've read them I may be exaggerating certain things about the books in my mind. One example of a question I plan on asking my buddy is this:

 Does Nynaeve really tug on her braid 15,000 times during the series?

Did Lanfear disappear for 6 books like I remember or is my memory just faulty?

I know there are a lot of things that probably aren't quite as ridiculous as I remember them but I'd like to hear from others some things they might like to ask from someone who has just finished the series again.

At What Point did WoT hook you? Sorry if this has been asked before, but I'm curious...

Can you name the moment, scene/paragraph/chapter/etc, in any book that you got hooked, for better or worse, thinking... this is awesome.


for me, it was Moraines speech about Manetheren in the Two Rivers,  gave me shivers, loved it.. and still does every time I read it.

WoT revisited I decided that I've talked about revisiting the Wheel of Time series for long enough and am finally taking the plunge. I've read Eye of the World 6 times before, the first time when I was 15 and the last time shortly after college about 12 years ago. I decided that audiobook would probably be the best format and I don't know if the euphoria will continue throughout the entire series but my first 6 hours of listening were pure joy. My early impression is that audiobook IS the perfect format to revisit an old favorite because it doesn't matter if I miss a detail here and there since I know what's happening but the audiobook format allows me to sort of listen while thinking about how my memory differs in little ways from what actually happens.

Anyone else revisit an old favorite recently either through audiobook or actually reading them and find themselves giddy? Or were you disappointed? Did format make a difference to you?

Looking for some gritty recommendations. I’ve been reading series such as WoT and Stormlight Archive, and while they’re great and I do love them, I’m finding them a bit formulaic and am looking for some more grit. I’ve read GoT and loved them, loved all the political intrigue and am looking for something to scratch that itch. All the political bits in series such as WoT or stormlight seemed to be explained to the reader, I’m looking for something a bit more nuanced and with less certain good and bad sides, and far less predictable twists. Anyone got any good reads along these lines?

It's finally over for me... I started reading WoT in 1990, when I met my wife in college in 1990.  The books have been part of my iife thought my marriage and my 2 children growing up.

When the last WoT book was published, I read it in eager anticipation just wanting to see what would happen.  And when I finished, I sat back and said to myself "It's not over yet.  I still have to read 'New Spring!' "  Well, I just finished the New Spring audiobook.  And I'm a little bummed that there is no more Wheel of Time to read now.  I was surprised that the end of the audiobook had a small 4 minute interview with Robert Jordan at the end.  Kind of a bittersweet treat.

Now that it is TRULY over for me, I REALLY hope that Tor and Harriet don't decide to make a quick buck in the future by allowing other authors to write WoT in-betweenquels.

Let’s just take a moment to appreciate some of the unique aspects of this incredible series There are a lot of things to love about WoT. It has a bunch of great characters, cultures, magic, and concepts. This thread is basically just appreciating some of the things that make this series unique.

Something I love about this series is how grounded it is, despite being so fantastical. Like, when I think Lord of the Rings, it is very obviously fantastical and unreal. WoT is different. In a world with the One Power, giant human-animal hybrid monsters, and supernatural wolves who exist in a dream world, everything still feels very grounded. I don’t know how else to explain it. It all feels so human, and so real, despite being a series with 10 foot creatures that sing to make trees grow.  I love it.

So what are some things you guys love about WoT that makes it unique or at least unusual?

[No Spoilers] Does Eye of the World Get More Interesting? I'm about 12 hours into the audiobook, having read all of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere work and wanting to work my way through this series to his WoT books, but...it's just been so damn dry so far! I like the characters, and I like the writing style, but for goodness sake when is something going to happen? They've just been walking through the woods and being in awe of big towns and cities ever since they left the village, with one or two breaks for a monster attack. All of the main characters are just getting roped along into running from the baddies without actually having any drive or desires of their own. For being one of the most famous, heralded fantasy series in western canon, I find myself being so underwhelmed by the plot so far. Aside from the fact that nothing has really happened yet, what \*has\* happened boils down to the exact same fantasy story we've seen since LOTR; a farmboy chosen one who's probably going to destroy the dark lord.


I still intend to stick with the series as long as I can, I just have to know, at what point does stuff start happening?

Possible shared universe theory/question / food for thought [spoiler] possible I just finished listening to "Saints" and damn was it amazing. John Ringo is the writer that got me into Sifi / fantasy and reading in general. I've been a huge fan of Larry since the MHI series. So here is my Question / Theory.

Ringo also wrote the Posleen War series, first series I ever read. In it there was a SF Catholic church SRT team, I believe this same type of team was mentioned in the Posleen war series. In the Cally series they go into the background about how its space related but I'm choosing to ignore that for right now. Again in the Posleen war series (not sure which book) a character relates a story about when He was in the military and his unit was wiped, maybe, (I'm a little fuzzy on the details, it's been forever since i read the series) while fighting a Master Vampire (I assume it was a Master). Is it possible that the Posleen war world and MHI world are the same universe? Ringo has written for both so maybe it is just a style thing I'm picking up on but I would like to think it is true. Maybe I missed a reference to Cazadore AL, being one of the few holdouts during the invasion? probably not but I like to think so.

I really enjoy grand theory stuff and small plot points that come back to be big things, Like in WOT or Cosmere stuff so maybe I am stretching a bit too much.

Please tell me in detail how/ why you think I am wrong or right? Maybe its been confirmed or debunked already and I just couldn't find it. Also if you are a fan of the MHI series and you haven't ready the [Legacy of the Aldenata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Aldenata) I highly recommend it. Start with the Main series, some of the 1 offs and Cally's War stuff can get a bit different, but I've read them all.

Book 2 of the Sanderson trilogy, another excellent entry. There’s no way Jordan could have made these into just one book.

**Stuff I Liked**

* Perrin- Perrin really dominates the first three quarters of this book and I think it works really well. At first I hated it because I had no idea where the wolf dream or Whitecloak storylines were going but I think everything came together in a great way. Perrin is one of the paragons of “The Slog” so it was nice seeing him have some action in his story; this is easily the most interesting he’s been since The Shadow Rising. Some good character work as well as he accepts his life as a wolf and chooses to become a Lord. His victory against Graendal’s forces was awesome but the highlight of this storyline is the battle in Tel’aran’rhiod. At first when Perrin runs toward Tar Valon with the dreamspike I thought he might pull a Gawyn and ruin everything but it ended up being a really crazy confrontation between himself and Slayer alongside Egwene and Mesaana. I loved him looking down on Egwene as a novice and just imagining flows away. Egwene feels pretty high and mighty about her TAR abilities but Perrin gives her a rude awakening (no pun intended) via his true mastery of the World of Dreams. Wheel of Time doesn’t really like killing off major good guys, which I think makes Hopper’s death even more unexpected and heartbreaking. I was not ready for that, I love Hopper. The pure anguish Perrin feels over losing his best friend is crushing to read.


* Tower of Ghenjei- Man that was a lot of fun, the trip to the Tower absolutely lived up to my expectations. Ever since they introduced the idea of cheating the Finns I have been wondering how the heck they were going to do that. It was a great reveal of the Aelfinn’s three gifts to Mat, the memories, the medallion, and the ashanderei to get him out of the Tower. What really blew my mind the most was “giving up half the light to save the world.” The moment it clicks that Mat losing his eye is what satisfies that line is one of the great ohhhhhhhh moments of the series. Add that to the list of things where Mat draws parallels to Odin: one eye, uses a spear, connection to ravens, big floppy hat, maybe others, I don’t know.


* Taishar Malkier- We get like two minutes of Lan but I loved reading his POV. I loved him thinking about Nynaeve through the Bond, and how even though he is sad she will feel his death he is comforted that he knows she is safe. I loved the unexpected comedy of his failure to keep people quiet about who he was and what he was doing. And I loved, loved, loved his final claim of his rightful title as King of Malkier before riding off to fight an army more than ten times his size.



**Stuff I Didn’t Like**

* Rhiudean 2.0- Before I continue I have to say I loved the little Aviendha arc we get, and her philosophizing about the purpose of the Aiel after they have met their toh to the Aes Sedai. But I have some issues with the trip into the future of the Aiel. Rand’s journey through the glass columns is one of the iconic moments of the series for me and so I felt like this was kind of riding the coattails of another great scene, although it was a decent twist on the same concept. Also, if everything we see is true it kind of gives away a lot of what’s going to happen. Rand wins the confrontation against the Dark One (duh), he kneels to the Crystal Throne, and all the non-Seanchan nations are bound together in a peace deal (north and east bound, south and west, making the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai, which is a pretty cool idea). The most depressing thing is that the Seanchan’s Return totally works and they eventually conquer everyone, which to me is a massive bummer. However, the implication of Aviendha’s final thoughts is that maybe there is a way to change the fate of the Aiel, which is interesting. Also, she’s gotta pregnant at some point and I don’t know when she and Rand would have time to make babies, he’s kinda busy right now.

* Mrs. Merrilin- Moiraine never struck me as the marriage type. We know Thom pines for her after she “dies” but I always took it as he was more revering someone he respected and that she might be someone he could love if she wasn’t Aes Sedai. Guess things changed on that front. On a related note, the Morgase/Tallanvor romance is super lame and has never made a ton of sense. I did find it interesting though that the couples agree to marry in front of Mat and Perrin, which of course we know that one of the most common effects of ta’veren is sudden marriages.


**Who I’d Like to See More Of**

* The Dragon Reborn- This is it, time for Rand to save the world. I am pumped.

* Androl- What is going on at the Black Tower? At the end of KOD we get the “let the lord of chaos rule” moment but we have yet to see any real development at the Black Tower. There may be a dreamspike there as well.


* Moiraine- Moiraine’s back, holy crap. I have no idea what her role is going to be but it is good to see her again, even though back in my FOH writeup I did say I thought it would be better if she really did just die.


**Who I’d Like to See Less Of**

* I don’t really know if I have a good answer to this.

**Miscellaneous**

* With one book left to go there are still quite a few plot points left to resolve: we have the forces of the Light marshalling at the Fields of Merrilor, Rand’s plan to break the seals, the invasion of Caemlyn, the Black Tower, the Seanchan haven’t been dealt with yet and they’re planning on a full on assault of Tar Valon, and oh yeah the Last Battle. Rand wants to meet with everyone tomorrow and then go straight to Shayol Ghul to break the seals. It seems like his plan is to do this before the Last Battle. I always pictured it as they fight the Last Battle and then Rand goes to defeat the Dark One but this implies he might face the Dark One before the Last Battle.

* Earlier I made a reference to Gawyn screwing everything up. He’s still one of my least favorite characters but I have to say I did relate to what he was going through in his first attempt to save Egwene. He really can’t handle just letting events unfold without trying to help, even though his attempts to help are really misguided. And he did have one cool moment where he puts out the light to fight the Bloodknives in the dark. But this scene does bring in an issue I have had before, which is that I get that he’s an insane swordsman but these are three ter’angreal aided assassins, he really shouldn’t have won that one. Look at how Galad barely survived fighting Valda one-on-one, and Gawyn takes on three people at once. It reminds me of the scene right after Mat gets Healed from the dagger and goes and whoops Galad and Gawyn’s asses. It’s one of the stupidest, least realistic moments for me this kid should barely be able to stand and he takes out two future blademasters. I just had another thought, based on what we’ve seen Gawyn is the best swordsman in the series.

* Can someone tell me, was Byar a Darkfriend? Or did he just really hate Perrin?

* Forsaken head count: Moridin chilling in his spooky tower, Graendal getting grounded by Shaidar Haran, Demandred just as AWOL as he’s been the whole time, Moghedien mindtrapped, Lanfear showing up in Rand’s dreams having a rough go of things.

* Seriously what the hell has Demandred been up to this whole time? It’s my understanding he was supposed to be Taim but fans figured it out and Jordan changed it.

* Verin made a really bad gamble assuming Mat could resist opening the letter. As a result, Caemlyn is going to get smashed by some Trollocs. Olver being a dumb kid has now played into the story for a second time, the first being him wandering off, which results in Mat getting trapped in Ebou Dar.

* I’m still not 100% sure how the dreamspike works, other than preventing Travelling. I wasn’t clear on its effects in Tel’aran’rhiod.

* This is crazy to me, there’s only one book left in this series. Reading A Memory of Light is going to be a bittersweet moment. There’s only one book left that I get to experience for the first time.

[spoilers] the wonderer? I am at the end of the crown of swords (my first time reading WoT and I got to the point Rand meets a man that saves him in Shadar logoth. I found the wheel of time series after reading most of Brandon Sanderson’s cosmere books and that man reminded me a lot of Hoid. Is it a Hoid style appearance? Come in do something and leave or is he a character later? If it is a big spoiler just RAFO me.

I can't stop thinking about The Wheel of Time [Spoilers] It's exactly been a month I finished reading The Memory of Light and I can't stop thinking about it.
I discovered Wheel of Time through Mistborn, and didn't like the series much until The Shadow Rising, fourth book in WoT series.
Robert Jordan's unparalleled world building style, his magic system, and his humor, yes his humor hooked me and I got through 14 frigging books of brick size.
This has been a very satisfying read. I read ASOIAF, Mistborn, LoTR, Harry Potter, but Wheel of Time left a void in my life nothing could fill up.
Yes, there are many flaws in the story, the female characters are annoying, but there are few moments in Wheel of Time I would reread forever.
So if you are a fantasy fan, and in dilemma to pick this series, please go ahead, don't think about the slog and stay away from the Internet. And I think Brandon Sanderson has spoiled few characters, especially Mat.
PS: I am also a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive and I wouldn't mind if it becomes my all time favorite series replacing The Wheel of Time in twenty years, in fact I am looking forward for it.

(Spoilers AMoL) The thing I’m most excited about for the show I have a lot of confidence this show will get it right. I think of shows like Game of Thrones and how they so successfully adapted the material to television (until they ran out of material) and I recognize WoT is set. There are so many powerful, epic moments that will translate exceptionally well to the screen.

What I’m most excited for is that the writers can look at the series as a whole and recognize where the adjustments need to be made. I think we will see major changes in just season one alone that readers will completely understand the necessity for. First thing that comes to mind is Mat. He needs more material early on, we need to establish him because he alone could sell this series imho. We need to see just how interesting and loveable he is from the very beginning, or at least give him a strong hate to love arc in the beginning.
In line with that thought, we need to have his relationship with Tuon more fleshed out. I actually love how they work in the books but I get the general criticism. There just wasn’t enough development. The writers will examine every single low point in the series and ask themselves, “can this be fixed ahead of time? How can we make this work?” And if it doesn’t work, guess what? It’s going to be axed and replaced with something that does. Those are the bricks.

I love this series and I’ve yet to find a fantasy epic as near to my heart. I’m excited for a tv show because it will be television. I don’t want a direct manuscript to manuscript reproduction because that would be a missed opportunity. I don’t think the writers will tell a better story, but am excited for them to tell a different story.

I recently started reading Wheel of Time and it's overhauled my perception of Kingkiller Chronicles This might be something a million people have discussed, but I usually avoid meta-discussion about things I actually like so I don't know how much this issue has been brought up.

I'm on book 6 of WoT (Lord of Chaos), so please don't spoil past that if you've read it.

I reread Kingkiller a few months before I started WoT, so both are fresh in my mind, so as I've read the latter I've noticed that Kingkiller pretty much reads like WoT fanfiction.  The way things are named (some names are just the same) and the many parallels/ripoffs (Aiel/Adem, Forsaken/Chandrian, World of Dreams/Fae world, etc.) initially seem like regular use of fantasy tropes, but the more I've read, the more I think Rothfuss is just a really big fan.

Now, of course, I love WoT, so I'm not complaining that all these great aspects of it show up in Kingkiller, but I'm a little disappointed to find out how derivative the latter is.  One of the most notable ripoffs is the way sword fights are narrated--all are given as a sequence of move names, which is admittedly a really cool, stylized way of doing it, but it feels so stale when I see how similar the two series are.

One of the things I think Kingkiller has going for it, though, is the way it's emphasized as a story over truth and how as far as we know Kvothe isn't exactly a Chosen One.  I feel like the only things that really separate the worlds is the perspective (Kingkiller is more boots-on-the-ground, dug into the layman's view while WoT feels more high-fantasy) and the path of the protagonist (Kvothe stays kind of low whereas Rand is already "leading" nations by book 6).

I don't think it \*really\* takes much away from Kingkiller but it's a little frustrating to know how much of it's flavor is straight from the palate of WoT.

If you know more than me about this, feel free to correct me, but this has been nagging at me forever.

Drawing parallels to WoT while reading other fantasy books, does anyone else do this? I’ve read through WoT twice now and it is one of my favorite series. I’m currently wrapping up Stone of Tears, book 2 of Terry Goodkind’s Sword of Truth series and I find myself constantly drawing parallels to WoT. Whether it be character traits, cast roles, different people/race similarities, it seems that I’m constantly discovering new lines of development that I can relate to WoT. It’s actually enjoyable and does not take away from Goodkind’s story. I think it stands testament to how much I enjoyed WoT and the literary impact it had on me. Does anyone else do this or have had similar reading experiences?

13 Months Later 1 year ago, I began listening to WoT on. audible. I just finished listening to AMoL an hour ago.

For 12 months, I avoided searching the web for any spoilers. I am surprised at myself for the level of Aes Sedai discipline I had to wield over the last year. Stillness in the Void.

Still, at the end of the series, I had one question that nagged at me: Will the Tinkers find their song? This question bothered me for months!

It was the first thing I searched on Google. The answer did not disappoint.

I feel at peace. Thank you RJ and BS for this wonderful journey! I am looking forward to a few years of forthcoming TV show.

I’m also wondering if books 5-11 will all be covered in one season :p

New To The Show I'm currently on my first readthrough of the WOT series and came across the podcast on iTunes looking for additional material.  I've listened to several of your other episodes on books I've previously read and your movie reviews and have really enjoyed the product you put out.  While I still have 9 books left in the WOT to power through, I was wondering if you keep a list on planned future series or know what you'll be doing next as it would be fun to keep up in real time allowing for conversation as opposed to coming in after the conversation has taken place, as I am with the WOT.  Either way, keep up the good work!

[Spoilers All] A Theory about the ending of A Memory of Light, the Dark One’s Nature, Mirror Worlds, and my thoughts about the series. This is probably going to be a bit long.

First of all, I’m going to throw shit to a lot of aspects of the series. Not because I hate It, at the contrary, because I love it. And I’m passionate about the things that I love, thing that makes me think, and thing that makes me have a strong opinion or criticism. Things that I don’t value I considered them not worthy of my criticism. I don’t have problem with big fun movies, they are just for entertaining, and because of that I don’t think a lot about it and I don’t have a big opinion of about them. Not in these case, not in the things that I’m passionate about. Not about Wot. That means that I’m going to throw shit to the things that I don’t like, so if you are here to read how much I love the series (thing that I do) you are going to be a bit disappointed.

So, let’s start.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pipe and Body-Swapping Theory**

This theory is about how Rand got to lit the pipe and how Moridin and Rand changed bodies.

It all starts when Moridin with Callandor is forced to link with Nynaeve and Moraine, and they link with Rand. I think that all of their channeling was passing through Callandor. I don’t think that if any of them was channeling without passing in it would be enough to seal the Bore, (Or maybe It would), I think that Callandor is always indirectly canalized together with Saidar when used properly because of its flaw. Rand is the only question here, as I said before I don’t think without Callandor It would be enough, but I don’t see clearly how Rand would have channeled Saidin through Callandor if not through his link with Moridin but this doesn’t happen because It is explicitly said that Rand was channeling Saidin, and Rand body died probably because of channeling fatigue or maybe because of guiding all three power (probably not because Moridin body was in better state). The important thing is that all of the three powers where passing through Moridin, even though Rand was the one guiding them. It is here when we learn that the True Power is necessary to remade the Dark One’s prison, and I think that this is because the True Power is part of what makes the Pattern, not only Saidin and Saidar, because is only when the three powers are channel that they channel “Light itself” and remake the Dark One’s Prison which is if you remember the Pattern itself. It is weird that to channel that Light it would be needed to channel the True Power, being this the essence of the Dark One, It should be possible to do it with only Saidin and Saidar, but it isn’t, it is needed too the True Power, meaning that Shai’tan is not only the anti-Pattern force but somehow a part of the Pattern. Anyway, the True True Source, the Three Powers are being canalized through Moridin body to Callandor, thing that somehow gives to Moridin’s body (not soul), at least temporarily, Pattern bending abilities, like a super Ta’veren. Nynaeve and Moraine are relatively ok and escape, this is the thing that I don’t understand, why were Moraine and Nynaeve pretty ok, when rand was awful, I don’t know if this is because there were two women channeling Saidar or because Rand was not channeling through Callandor, I don’t know. Rand is carrying Moridin’s body until he collapses because of his wound. Here is when appears Nakomi and says “Yes, That is what you need to do.” This phrase doesn’t make much sense in the scene. And I think that that phrase doesn’t go to, it goes to Moridin. I’m one of those who think that Nakomi is probably Tigraine, she followed strictly Aes Sedai foretellings so I can see that she continues doing that, but mostly I think that Nakomi is a character that should have been taken out but was left to respect for Jordan, who would have done a way better job of giving clues for whoever she was. Whatever, I think that Nakomi probably was a character that had contact with Moridin and tried to convince him to be good. I think that “That is what you need to do” was when Moridin started carrying Rand’s body outside the cave and after that, thanks to his Pattern bending abilities, he swapped bodies (or souls) with Rand so that Rand could live, somehow redeeming himself. I think that Moridin’s body was severed from the powers because of all of the channeling that went through his body but he remained alive because the Powers are more powerful and less damaging combined, resulting in remaining alive. In Rand case I think that was different, he burnt himself from channeling so much Saidin and guiding the Powers didn’t help him as much as channeling them, so even though his cut from Ishamael should have stopped bleeding so much, he still channeled too much, leaving his body useless. This is how Rand lit his pipe, I don’t think that this ability would last for long, for the same reason that the disturbance in the Pattern caused by the Bowl of the Winds didn’t last much.

I don’t know if things this specific can be considered theory because is like totally not true. Maybe it is a type of fanfic? Well, let just call it my head cannon.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dark One’s Nature** (I promise you that this is shorter)

In the Third Age, in the lands of Hawkwing’s world, and I think that in the Age of Legends as well, the Dark One or Shai’tan is called the antithesis of the Creator, and I think that this is totally wrong. The Creator created or will create, it always happened or will never happened, the Wheel of Time, and in my opinion, the Dark One is totally a part of the Wheel of Time. His mere existence changes the probability as much as the laws of Causality, although the Wheel of Time is designed to be destroy by the Dark One, the Dark One is designed to never destroy the Wheel, always choosing the possibility of destroying everyone’s will (thing that is impossible because of how the Pattern works), over simply destroying the Wheel and make his own universe. I always thought that the creation of the Wheel of Time was impossible, because it was like making a glass that breaks before it is made, but because of the flaws of Shai’tan it is possible to see how with infinite possibilities he will have infinites defeats.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mirror Worlds**

I have always wondered what were Mirror Worlds, you could say that the Pattern exists so that Mirror Worlds doesn’t. For a time, a thought that were like the eyes of the Pattern, the Pattern weaving different realities so that it can know where to go, but that doesn’t makes sense the Wheel is infinite it should already know. And then a thought appeared. Mirror Worlds are other turnings of the Wheel! It could be that the Mirror Worlds are what the Pattern was Weaving in other turnings. There is really no evidence or solid base for this, is just an idea.

I too think that some Mirror Worlds, such as Tel’aran’rhiod, are parallel worlds where souls are waiting to be reborn. In Tel’aran’rhiod non domestic animals and heroes are waiting to be reborn. I think that there is other Mirror World more deep were the souls of humans and domestic animals rest. The souls in Tel’aran’rhiod are reborn quickly, such as we see with Birgitte, while in that deeper Mirror World it is more slowly the process to reborn, such as we see with Rand. I too think that souls in Tel’aran’rhiod don’t really die because the Wheel is infinite and that stuff, maybe they go the deeper Mirror World.

Tel’aran’rhiod it is such weird place, supposing that all of this is true (wich it isn’t) it would be a place were other turnings connect while being the place were souls rest. It doesn’t make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I was planning on writing my thoughts in the series but I’m too tired now, maybe I will edit this post or make a new one. That would give me a little more time to think about it. (I finished two weeks ago) please comment Im very interested in what you think, and link me WoB and WoJ? the topics.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m such a nerd.

[No Spoilers] Stormlight Archive chapter summarises

are there any chapter by chapter summarises of SA ? like the ones for WOT.

there are many WOT summarises but i found this one ( http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/index.html ) and the format of the ecyclopedia as a whole really helpful. This can be especially useful to catch up properly on all the previous books before reading the next for people who don't have the time to re-read the whole thing, also this helps point out some foreshadowing that can be useful when re-reading

if there isn't one, why don't we make one ?
if there is, is there one for mistborn? because i think it also needs it with how big its turning out to be.

WOT cannot catch a breath: first Sanderson desecrated it with his terrible fan fictions, now Judkins wants to violate it After reading the QA, I feverishly hope that this adaptation will die before reaching the small screens.

Poor Robert Jordan ... at least he does not know what had happened to his series, and at least he does not know what will happen to his series.

I'm so angry that words fail me.

Been wondering if I should start WoT. A bit conflicted since people say the first book(s) is/are slow? I know mostly everyone here are fans, but I was wondering how you guys felt when starting out the series? Do you have to push through to get to the good parts or was it instantly enjoyable?

Windrunner's 4th ideal Speculation I'm a big Wheel of Time fan who recently read up through Oathbringer and I've loved it. I'm listening to the Wheel of Time audiobooks to get some more fantasy adventure, and I'll spoil part of book 1 of WoT to make a connection i liked.

The Malkieri oath of kings, seen as hardline warriors who fight against the Dark one, swore the following oath:

*To stand against the Shadow so long as iron is hard and stone abides. To defend the Malkieri while one drop of blood remains. To avenge what cannot be defended.*

The role of the borderlanders to defend the world feels not dissimilar to Kaladin's oaths to defend those around him. To my head, defending for the borderlanders would be the goal or first ideals, and avenging being the hardline later ideals. For a wind runner, an ideal might say , I will avenge those that I could not save.

So why does Kaladin not say the next ideal?

I think it is because he is lost after seeing Elhokar die by the hands of someone he trusted. He is avoiding the blatant issue that the righteous thing is something deeply personal. For Kaladin to grow, he must acknowledge that he must kill Moash.

I think Syl picked Kaladin at his worst, when he was broken, needing the power to live. Living with a deep regret of not defending his soldiers, and also a deep hatred of Amaram. He is the personality that would defend the weak, but has been powerless to act of vengeance before. Syl would pick someone who would grow into someone fitting an Honor spren's nature. And the borderlanders are as classical 'honor' archetype as I can think of.

I've seen many theories on him turning to an ideal accepting those he could not save. To me, Honor was a flawed entity in the same way Odium and Cultivation are. Flawed in that they don't encompass all things that make us 'human'. So an ideal following the path of honor might pull Kaladin from being less 'human', more of an ideal knight.

Thoughts?

Help me understand my girlfriends gift! Hey guys, so as anyone sensible who has read the WoT series, Mat Cauthon is my favourite character. It's been some time ago since I read the series myself, but my girlfriend just started the series and I of course let her know that Mat is by far the best. So I just received a T-shirt in the mail with one of his best quotes, besides, perhaps the one about goats.. BUT, there are three images above the quote, and I have no clue how they are correlated to Mat! Did my memories betray me and am I an unworthy Mat fanboy, or are you guys just as confused?

This is the shirt: http://imgur.com/8zaeYJt

Also, I never post stuff. I read the rules, but if this isn't according to some rules I apologize l :)

I can't get into the Eye of the World Hi, newcomer to WoT here. I recently bought the Eye of the World because my teacher recommended it, but I can't seem to get into it. I'm about halfway through but am slowing down. I'm usually good with long books (read LotR in about a week) but I seem to be struggling with this one. Any advice?

Would I enjoy Wheel Of Time? I know the *very* basic plot - women are magic and they’re totally rad, but magic men are killed cos they go mental, and it sounds cool enough that I wanna read it.

*But*

I can’t read fantasy. I tried LOTR, couldn’t even finish Bilbo’s party. I tried a Robin Hobb book (something about an assassin?) could get through it. I also did try the WoT prequel, but I gave up halfway through. My problem is the excessive descriptions of literally everything, like how it takes 2 pages to describe a tree. Is the main series of WoT that bad? I read the first ASOIAF book and that was fine, but I’ve heard all the rest he never shuts up when writing about food.

Reading TEoTW and here is what I think [No Spoilers] Even though I love reading fantasy and every time I try reading something else, somehow I always get back to the genre. I always put this series away and I only own the first book due to everyone I know telling me it's LoTR knock off, it's boring and predictable ...etc.

And honestly I am loving it, granted I never really read LoTR and only watched the movies but still, I don't see or feel the resemblance.

And you know with any book you can imagine how a character looks, the scenery, the conversations but with WoT, it feels like I am seeing everything, it's as if I am watching a movie in front of me. I really don't know why but I can imagine everything far better than I ever could with any other book.

I am posting this because no other story had me this excited since Malazan book of the fallen.

What's your favourite fanart? So I've only recently read the series for the first time (I actually posted my thoughts a [few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/94zjnh/on_january_1st_i_started_the_wheel_of_time_last/)) and I haven't seen any main fanart. I'd love to see some of the greater fanart, how some of the characters and peoples are imagined by other readers. (I never really imagined the lightning panel dress of the Sul'dam properly, I think) so shoot, let's see what you've got!

A new detail revealed on re-read I’ve read WoT at least five times, if not more, and it’s always exciting to pick up details that I never noticed before! The depth of the series is amazing.


I just read this section of book one from one of Rand’s first dreams

“I whispered in Artur Hawkwing’s ear, and the length and breadth of the land Aes Sedai died. I whispered again, and the High King sent his armies across the Aryth Ocean, across the World Sea, and sealed two dooms. The doom of his dream of one land and one people, and a doom yet to come. At his deathbed I was there when his councilors told him only Aes Sedai could save his life. I spoke, and he ordered his councilors to the stake. I spoke, and the High King’s last words were to cry that Tar Valon must be destroyed.”

[nonspoiler here] This gives us interesting insight into how Ishamael influences and formed the Seanchan culture that is later so impactful, as well as split and destroyed Hawkwings empire.

I just had a question regarding Rand's love interests. I'm kind of conflicted because of Rand's love for 3 women.

I'm kind of a conservative when it comes to love and believe that a person should love only one other person at a time. If they start developing feelings for someone else, they should address such feelings before doing something drastic. But I digress.

WoT has a lot of plotlines and themes which take True Love into account.

I get that Min and Rand share a close bond and love each other. They have actually spent a great deal of time together and Min is the only one who sees Rand as a sheepherder caught up in something much bigger than himself. In fact, in the latter half of the series, she's one of the reasons he's grounded in reality.

Aviendha and Rand started off as uneasy companions who slowly acknowledged their feelings for each other culminating in their "night of passion" in an igloo. She teaches him Ji'e'toh and the Aiel way of life. He, in turn, helps her understand Wetlanders, among other things. They both complement each other and are a great couple.

It's just my opinion, but I feel that Rand and Elayne were rushed as a couple and never really given enough time to develop. When they started off, they were like a sheepherder and princess biting the forbidden fruit and kind of went on with it. Rand spent considerable time with Elayne only in the Stone of Tear, where they were more like horny teenagers than the Dragon Reborn and Daughter-Heir of Andor (a fitting couple on paper; I know they were teenagers then).

Did Elayne and Rand have any other chemistry? As far as I know, they are the weakest couple among all 4 pairings (If you include Aviendha-Elayne).

What are your thoughts on this? Am I forgetting something? I may not be clear on the details as I just finished the series and may have forgotten a few of the earlier plotlines.

"Must-read" sections of the Wot Companion? As soon as the Wheel of Time Companion was released, I bought the hard cover. For nearly three years, it has been sitting on my shelf. I've recently come to terms with the fact that as much as I love this world, I will never crack this encyclopedia open with the intent to read it cover to cover. So I ask of you, the better fans who have done so, what are the sections that I simply shouldn't pass up? Are there hidden gems or untold stories that evoke the kinds of feelings we all had when reading the novels?

Why do people say Eye of the World is an LOTR clone? There are ideas which are obviously derivative or at least inspired by LOTR (black riders with cowls covering faces coming to a nice little village for one, little fellowship, some other stuff) but a lot of times I've seen people use language such as "clone" or "copy".

I've read the first three books and am 300 pages or so into the 4th but I dont really see any kind of non-superficial resemblence. I'm no Tolkien scholar but I am a huge fan and have read LOTR, the Silmarillion, the Children of Hurin, and am reading Beren and Luthien as well and to me theres just so little similarity between them in terms of pacing, characters, the world...

Hell I read on Wikipedia that Jordan supposedly admitted that Emonds Field was supposed to be a ripoff of the Shire but they dont even seem remotely similar to me either...

To me a lot of places and events in LOTR were as representative of ideas, feelings or concepts as much as in world objects and I feel like thats a fundamental aspect of Tolkiens writing...and I dont really see even an attempt to mimic that in WoT so far.

Am I missing anything?

At the publication of which book did you find the Wheel ? Were you an early trend setter that read EoTW then patiently waited for each addition or did you come across it after AMoL was done and dusted and got to binge read them My personal WoT journey started in 91 when i got the first 3 and luckily for a few years i got a book a year after that. Didn't realise i was strapping in for a 22 year journey to get the final book.

[spoilers all] Androl So, I love Androl. I know he gets a lot of hate for being out of place, and it’s been mentioned that he was made wholecloth by Sanderson , and that RJ never made the character. But I noticed something that I love that just seems to double down on the fact that he is SANDERSON’S character.

When Androl is fighting Taim in the black tower, he diverts a stream of balefire through a “coin sized gateway”. That’s pretty cool and quick-thinking, but the important part is that the dream spike was *still in place*. The dreamspike, that is supposed to stop gateways from being created, and does, didn’t quite stop him.

If you’re familiar with Sanderson’s works, you probably have read his series, Mistborn. When I read this, I immediately thought of his magic system in Mistborn, with allomantic metal burning. And in that magic system, the more you burn a metal(like, continuously) the better you get with it, until you become a savant with that metal. Spoilers [Spook]. I just thought it was neat.

Tl;dr Androl is the WoT equivalent of a savant from another of Sanderson’s series.

Book recommendations fae Hey, not sure if this has been posted about yet but I am curious if anyone has recommendations for Fantasy books centering around fae magic or with a fae realm (or other dimensions). I am obsessed with the king killer chronicles and am a big fan of Sanderson. I love the unique take on fae creatures in kingkiller and also love the uniqueness of the magic systems in Sanderson's novels. Have spent a lot of time scouring kindle for under the radar fantasy and am going through some major quality withdrawal after rereading both kingkiller novels and the latter half of the stormlight archive. I'm having a hard time getting back into WoT after a short hiatus and need something that will grab my attention quickly.

Sorry for the long post, just getting a little desparate for something fast paced and well written. Any suggestions would be great.

Just finished the audio books, and incredibly grateful for the therapeutic distraction. My mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer late last October. Its been a pretty rough year. If you have ever had someone in your life with a serious illness, you know that awful feeling. You get to that point were stress and anxiety can take over. Sometime in March I knew I needed a mental distraction and figured the WOT audio books would work. My mom gave me the Eye of the world back in 1996. Continued to read the books when i was younger and loved the story. I just finished the whole audio series today. My mom is know recovering from chemo and a Whipple procedure. Hoping things continue stay positive. Those audio books were the help I needed. Can't sleep, long hospital nights, or just plan don't want to think about it moments. I get the the wheel weaves as the wheel wills but seriously fuck cancer and thank god for a good story to help you forget about real life for awhile. Or for at least around 419 hours.

Wheel of Time - Audiobook vs. Reading Hey all you WoT fans!  Just wondering...is the audiobook experience more enjoyable than reading the books?  I've heard Michael Kramer and Kate Reading do a very great job.  Just wondering because with epic fantasy books like this, I could see how all the names and places get a little confusing as you are listening on your commute, rather than looking up a map or the glossary.

And so we reach the final book. An end. I will make a wrap-up post for the series as a whole but I want to put down my thoughts about A Memory of Light separate from everything else. Normally I include sections on which characters I'd like to see more/less of in the next book, but seeing as that isn't possible I'll just confine those sections to this book.


**Stuff I Liked**

* The Flame of Tar Valon: I unfortunately got spoiled that Egwene was going to die so her death itself was not a shock, but this moment did not lose any of its weight for me. What a beautiful ending to Egwene's arc. The melding of the Five Powers into one healing weave, the anti-balefire, perfectly mirrors Egwene's goal to bind the Ajahs together to make a whole White Tower. In the end the power of the Aes Sedai does not come individually but as a single entity; the White Tower stands. I also just love watching Egwene flex on fools. Fuck all of you who don't like Egwene. On the point of creating the all powers weave, it was a nice precursor to what Rand ends up doing to seal the Dark One.


* The Last Battle: For being a chapter stretched over nearly 250 pages the final battle at the Fields of Merrilor felt perfectly paced. It essentially had the same arc as a normal book might have: the introduction of the forces and their positions, the back and forth of Mat vs Demandred, building to the climax of the Horn sounding and Lan's defeat of Demandred. It was long but it needed to be. I thought Sanderson handled many of the deaths very well, including how abrupt some of them were. Siuan dies; such is war. The one major death that shocked me was Birgitte. I think it was maybe three sentences where she gets stabbed and beheaded. Quick. I don't know why I thought she was sort of untouchable but I had to stop for a minute after that one. Looking back her conversation with Elayne about losing her memories and her rebinding to the Horn was another fantastic arc for a character I love.

* Character building: We have already learned everything we need to know about the major players. But Sanderson still manages to do some great character work amidst all the action. Like I said above, Birgitte and Egwene had perfect ends, not plotwise but as summations of their character traits and journeys. Sanderson even slipped in some extra character work for Logain in amongst all the finales for everyone else, very nice.


* Light and Shadow: Rand's realization that killing the Dark One was bad for the world was excellent. All through the series we've been pounded over the head with the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai. The white and black together. To save the world he needed not to destroy Darkness but to bring it back into balance with the Light.



**Stuff I Didn’t Like**

* Lan's death: I thought it was better for Lan to have died killing Demandred. At first. Before you come for my head let me explain. It felt so much more impactful that Lan's final charge was, like Egwene, a suicide mission. His "I came here to kill you" line felt much more appropriate for a man who was fated to die at that time as opposed to saved at the last moment. But. Here I'd like to echo my earlier point about the end of character arcs. Lan's whole life has been dedicated to avenging Malkier, by dying fighting the Shadow. But his relationship with Nynaeve brings him new purpose, a reason to live on. So I actually am okay with him surviving, he has changed from the man who was going to ride alone to Tarwin's Gap because he is going to live. (Plus if he died with Demandred Nynaeve would have gone insane so bullet dodged there).

* Great captains: For some reason the term great captain feels weird to me, not a fan. But that's not what I'm talking about. I loved Graendal's Compulsion on the Four Homies but the precursor battles were kind of boring. While reading, it felt like sort of the same "there's too many, we need to fall back." I get it, you can't just instantly go from 0-100 that your generals are fucking up but as I was going through it, I was feeling a little bored until the Compulsion was revealed.

* Shara: It was pretty clever to have Demandred bring the Sharans to his side by fulfilling their prophecies but as a whole I did not like the idea of bringing them in. We had almost no mentions of Shara throughout the whole series so tossing them in as a massive force with soldiers and channelers felt out of place. Considering what we know of Demandred and his feelings towards Lews Therin it was neat having him mirror Rand but yeah adding the Sharans felt weird and tacked on.


**Who I’d Liked to See More Of**

* Nynaeve: She and Moiraine stood in a windy tunnel. And that's it. In reality, Moiraine's return and speech at Merrilor was cool and Nynaeve saving Alanna was interesting (did not expect her to show up at the Pit of Doom). But yeah for the most part these two stood around for the majority of the book.

* Moridin: He also doesn't get to do anything. He confronts Rand but then Rand immediately faces the Dark One. And then Rand comes back and goes on to save the day. I was surprised that Moridin got almost the same amount of actual screentime as Moghedien (not accounting for him standing there frozen in time). Demandred must be pissed that *he* didn't get to stand frozen with Lews Therin for all that time.

* Forsaken: We get Demandred and Moghedien but I don't think we get a POV of Graendal, Moridin, or Lanfear. It would have been fun to climb into one of their minds one last time.


**Who I’d Liked to See Less Of**

* Tuon: I had always liked the budding relationship between Mat and Tuon because it felt so different from all the other character dynamics. Plus it's always fun to see Mat off-balanced. But as a character I realized while reading this book that I kind of hate Tuon. She never concedes a point that isn't Seanchan dogma. She has all the Queenly self-importance of Elayne or Egwene but without the added ability to actually admit she is wrong. I hate that the end of the story has Min pretty much enslaved to the Seanchan. She deserves so much better.

* Slayer: Look, Perrin and his mastery of the wolf dream is all awesome. But Slayer as a villain is not as much fun as Graendal or Moridin. I think if he had actually been developed in between The Shadow Rising and Towers of Midnight I might care more. On that note, Padan Fain got tossed to the wayside and he seems to show up just for the sole purpose of tying up a loose end. Mat's character has come so far that the dagger doesn't seem as important, and therefore his confrontation with Fain had no emotional resonance.

* Olver: For whatever reason Olver always bugged me so him being Hornsounder was more of an eye roll moment for me. I thought it was cool that Faile had it, as a former Hunter. I have to say though, Sanderson writes his immaturity very well into his POV and I did feel really bad when he's hiding from the Trollocs in the little cleft.

**Miscellaneous**

* Rand's ending was very much like Lan's: a man whose life purpose was to die ends up living. And like Lan at first I thought "wait he lives?" but now I actually like Rand's ending. He had to have all the weight of being the Dragon on his shoulders for so long. He doesn't deserve death. He deserves to live life as a free man. The Dragon is reborn.

* So what exactly did Alivia do?

* I thought it was interesting that Moiraine would go the the Pit of Doom, considering her weaker ability in the Power now. But Rand needed moral support over strength I suppose. Also, when did Nynaeve cut her hair?

* Olver has got to be Gaidal Cain, right? He's an ugly little boy. As Birgitte says goodbye to Elayne she says she is being reborn at that moment, which means there's what a ten year difference between her and Gaidal? We already know that it isn't consistent between which is older. Plus, after the Horn is blown we never hear mention of Gaidal being at the battle. As one of the most well known Heroes you'd think we'd see him. And if he wasn't Olver, Birgitte could have had a reunion moment as they would both be summoned. Maybe being Gaidal Cain will make me like Olver more now.

* I am kind of shocked Moghedien is alive. I would have bet everything that all of the Forsaken would die.

* Okay now I see why you guys like Talmanes so much.

* Shout out to Brandon Sanderson. That is a monumental task taking on one of the genre's most beloved works and another author's magnum opus. I know he didn't do things exactly like Jordan but by and large he delivered three great books and managed to sail this massive ship into the harbor.

* It feels weird that there are no more books left. I've been so consumed with reading Wheel of Time that I have no idea what I want to read next. Whatever it is it can't possibly stand up to this series. Maybe I'll find something short and fun to be a buffer before I dive into something more substantial.

* I'm going to take a little time to compose another one of these writeups for the series as a whole but when I do I'll put the link here: .

To shill or not to shill for Sanderson today? Just joking, of course I shill for him every *phone rings*

"Yes?"
"It' me."
"There's a problem?"
"There's a huge problem."

There was nothing about Sanderson in r/books yesterday. Not even a 'Mistborn is my favourite book, you should read it!' or 'Thanks for kind stranger who introduced me to Sanderson!'"
"Yeah, I focused on King yesterday. Anyway, I think posting ads in r/WoT is more useful. Every second day I post about AMOL and the other books written by him, and the community eats it up. The idiots."
"Useful idiots, useful idiots."
"OK, so any new request?"
"Return to r/books, just be sure. His sales are not very good, so we need new readers."
"Maybe you should release a good book written by a good writer."
"It's not an option. All living fantasy authors are crap."
"Agree. What about the reviews on Amazon?"
"We have an another guy to do that. But we have to lay low for a while, you know, the scandal a few weeks ago?"
"These imbeciles will not spot anything. They really think that the five star reviews are real."
"I have a meeting coming up. Anything else?"
"Sure. Money?"
"As usual. Check is in the mail."
"Hmm. I do not like it."
"Sue me."
"No need to hit the roof."
"All settled?"

Who should play Matrim Cauthon in the WoT live action series? Although I'm sure we all know that the series won't be coming out any time soon, I can't help but feel anxious about who they decide to cast as The One-Eyed gambling lady slayer. Mat is by far my favorite character, so much so that he was the only thing that got me through books 7-9. Every time I would see those dice at the start of a new chapter, I would breathe a sigh of relief and think "Ok, the last few hundred pages have been worth it".

With that in mind, the prospect of them miscasting my favorite being in all of fantasy terrifies me. So, I suppose that this is a long-winded way to ask the community whom they believe should be granted the honor of playing Mat bloody Cauthon.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: I have only read the series once, so my appreciation for the other narrators has yet to mature. I'm sure I'll learn to love everyone equally with time.

Hoping the new TV series leads into a rise in WoT popularity As big as our community is, theres not a lot of media concerning wot. The show itself will be great to have on it's own. My biggest hope is that we start seeing some great RPG video games or even a retry for someone to create a wot table top rpg. Maybe even just a published rule set that is incorporated into 5e. Like adventures in middle earth did. The books are amazing and all, but I want to be in this world playing it too

[Series Spoilers] Now that the TV show is confirmed, what are your thoughts on show length, time period, and actors/actresses ageing As we know the WoT books are quite hefty, and each book (with very few exceptions) has a wonderfully written, complete arc. Should we expect each book to be adopted as one season of the TV show? That would leave us with a ginormous 14 Season series, at the conclusion of which non of the actors/actresses would look anything like their younger selves, even though supposedly only 3 years have passed in the story.

Looking at the closest proxy, Game of Thrones, they have 8 seasons of the show to cover 7 books, although admittedly the  Song of Ice and Fire books are more dense (e.g. more description of tea and skirts in WoT). Even they were criticised for speeding up the plot too much over the last couple of seasons (fast travel times etc).

There is also the matter of budgeting. I dare say WoT would require a bigger CGI budget than GoT if they are to faithfully represent channeling weaves etc. Also more environment and creature effects/costumes in WoT straight off from book 1 (trollocs, ogiers, the Blight, Shadar Logoth, the Eye) whereas Got got off with just some zombies and the Wall in Season 1 ...I think, obviously not as bit a fan of that series compared to WoT (they used regular pups as direwolves cubs)

Anyway I'm just keen on hearing what are some of your thoughts/expectations/hopes and dreams regarding this upcoming TV show.

Things to keep in mind with the announcement of a WoT TV series being officially greenlit. ***Mods, please excuse me if I am over-stepping myself with this post.  I don't intend this to look as if I'm trying to armchair mod or anything like that.***

**TL;DR** New fans incoming!  Let's welcome them into the fold and be mindful of our own attitudes so as not to come across as elitists.

With the show now officially greenlit it won't be long before we start seeing an influx of new WoT fans to the sub and once the show drops it'll likely jump up even more.  Try and remember that most of these visitors will be completely new to the series.  We'll be seeing tons of basic and simple questions.  Lot's of assumptions made that we already know how they play out, theories that we know the validity of and so forth.

Let's all remember that we were at the same point once and many still are even now as they complete their first read throughs.  We should all continue to focus on encouraging consumption of the series in any way.  Invariably the show will have differences, some small and some major.  Those differences shouldn't be held against someone though.  Let's not turn this sub into a readers vs viewers battleground.

Just as with GoT and Harry Potter, some people will choose the show to be their only source of enjoying the series.  Any reader would likely feel that this is doing themselves as disservice but it's their choice, not a reason to look or talk down to them.  I think we all can agree that any day a new fan is exposed to our beloved word is a good day, don't ruin that by being elitists.

Spoilers are something the sub already handles pretty well but now more than ever we should be mindful of them.  Don't ruin someone else's first time experiencing WoT with careless or even malicious info.  Even if the poster states that they aren't concerned with spoilers remember that they won't be the only ones reading.  The tagging is already there so be sure to use it.

Remember that just as we already see with new readers hitting the sub, all of these new viewers are potential new lovers and champions of the world that we already know and love so much.  Let's not turn them away to tell others, "I love Wheel of Time but their fanbase is the worst".  Be welcoming, helpful and respectful as well as being mindful of spoilers and we'll all get to see this great series reach a whole new generation of potential fans.  This [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1053/) explains exactly what my rambling is trying to.

One point for the Mods, with the show now coming for sure it may be time for some post filters/flair for at least books vs TV but maybe even comics, specific books, fluff, art, theory, tattoos, etc.  Might not be a bad idea to put up a poll or post asking for ideas/improvements to give the sub a small overhaul even.

[Spoilers All] Who would you be cast as? Marked as spoilers for the discussion.

Say that Rafe Judkins showed up at your doorstep and offered you a part in the new WoT series. Excluding the main characters (Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve; possibly also Elayne and Moiraine), who is the character you would be most excited about being cast as? Try to be realistic with age/gender when considering your answer.

For me, I would LOVE to play Verin Mathwin. I'd also be willing to wear a wig to play one of the Aiel Wise Ones.

OT: Amazon to make The Wheel of Time series I know this is OT, but we've had a WOT post in here or two in the past.
For those interested, The Hollywood Reporter says that Amazon is going to pick up The Wheel of Time. Season 1 will be seen from Moraine's POV. I wonder if they will start from New Spring? Dunno, but this is exciting news.

I'm stupid, I don't know how to ink to THR article.

Does anyone think this will fly?

Which characters can the show realistically fit on TV?: An analysis With the recent news of the Wheel of Time's official tv adaptation by Amazon becoming a reality, a lot of us have started wondering just how a series as complex and immense as this one could possible be adapted to the screen. The question is a fair one, primarily because the books just have so very many characters and plot lines that adapting them all directly could quite possibly lead to a confusing mess. According to Wikipedia and the Wheel of Time character compendium, there are nearly 2800 named characters in the series! Casting, hiring and writing for each of those roles is obviously effectively impossible, so it's clear that somewhere some cuts are going to have to be made.

But where is that somewhere? What's the natural cutoff point for the number of characters and plotlines a TV audience can juggle before losing the thread of the story, and what will that cutoff point look like for the Wheel of Time? Well, the answer to that second question sure seems to be between 35 and 40 total characters with no more than around 30 characters at a time. When you look at serious TV dramas that emphasize multiple interconnecting plots over multiple seasons, you tend to get a number of characters that hovers between 20 and 30. For example:

The most obvious point of comparison to WoT, the Game of Thrones TV show, has had ~40 main characters throughout its run, with the most listed in a single season being 29 in Season 6.

LOST, another show famous for its sheer volume of characters, had 34 starring characters with a season high of 28 in Season 6.

Downton Abbey has had 32 main characters across its series with a high of 25 main characters in Series 4.

The Wire (and yes I know WoT is superficially nothing like The Wire, but their story structure is definitely ambitious) had 36 main characters across its run, with a high of 24 characters in Season 5.

So it appears that the natural limit of the number of main characters either tv writers or watchers are willing to juggle in a series is 40. Who, then, are the

40 most important characters in The Wheel of Time? There are a couple of ways to go about this. An obvious one is word count by Point of View character in the novels; however, this is susceptible to not counting characters such as Lews Therin or Tam, who are definitely important but only get one short viewpoint in the series. Instead, I opted to use the number of times characters were mentioned in the books. There was almost no place I could find these stats officially, so ultimately I resorted to a Sporcle Quiz which claims to have an accurate count, linked below. (Yes, I know, not exactly scientific, but it seems to pass the eye test at the least.) Going off of this source, the forty most important characters in the series, and therefore the forty we can expect to get any real development over the TV show's lifetime, in order of mentions in the books, are:

Rand al'Thor
Egwene al’Vere
Mat Cauthon
Perrin Aybara
Elayne Trakand
Nynaeve al'Meara

Moiraine Damodred

Min Farshaw

Faile Bashere

Aviendha

Lan Mandragoran

Siuan Sanche

Thom Merrilin

Elaida do Avinry a'Rohain

Birgitte Silverbow

Gawyn Trakand

Loial

Cadsuane Meliadhrin

Tuon

Gareth Bryne

Verin Mathwin

Morgase Trakand

Galad Damodred

The Dark One

Tam al'Thor

Sheriam Bayanar

Lews Therin Telamon

Berelain sur Paendrag

Mazrim Taim

Moghedien

Amys

Davram Bashere

Logain Ablar

Leane Sharif

Masema Dagar

Talmanes Delovinde

Androl Genhald

Egeanin Tamarath

Rhuarc

Ishamael / Moridin


And, if you throw out The Dark One because he's not really a character that gets developed, the replacement at spot 41 is Lanfear.


And just in case several of these get cut, the next ten out are:

Rodel Ituralde

Juilin Sandar

Slayer

Gaul

Padan Fain

Pevara Tazanovni

Demandred

Romanda Cassin

Hurin

Ingtar Shinowa


The thing that strikes me most about the main list is that is truly contains the essentials for every major conflict in the series, with the one major glaring omission of Padan Fain. Every other character that is mildly important, such as Elyas Machera or Bayle Domon, can easily have their roles reduced to guest stars or bit characters and only appear in three or four episodes across the run of the series. Anyway, what are your guys’ thoughts on this list, and the structuring of the characters and plotlines in the TV show in general?

Which Character do you Like the Least? I don't know why I never thought to look for a WoT subreddit! I've been wanting to discuss this with someone forever but I'm the only giant, savaging nerd I know who has read these books. I'm home!

Okay, the question at hand. There are so many characters in the series, I feel like everyone has someone they don't like. From what I've gathered, for most people, it seems to be Perrin. I understand people not liking Perrin but I'm okay with him. He has some great sections.

I absolutely despise Nynaeve. I haven't listened through the series in a while so I cant remember specifics but I remember almost every time I was listening to her sections I really, really wanted to skip ahead. She's just so stubborn and pig headed. She would actually give me anxiety and that is not normal for me. I remember sitting in my car listening to it screaming something along the lines of "Just give it up! You're wrong!"

And I know she's integral to the story but I just cant handle her awful personality.

Who is your most hated and why?

Also, this is not a post to argue about why someone's opinion is right or wrong. Just a discussion.

Just Finished the Mistborn Trilogy I started the first *Mistborn* book - which I guess is supposed to be called *The Final Empire* but is just called *Mistborn* on the copy I got - around a month ago, and I just finished *The Hero of Ages* earlier today on the bus. Holy fuck, it's easily one of the best endings to a series I've ever read/seen.

&amp;#x200B;

I was introduced to Sanderson not long before I started the series, due to him being the one who took over *the Wheel of Time* after Robert Jordan died. There's a lot of debate regarding the infamous slog; where it begins, where it ends, etc. The latter is easy for me to determine, as I firmly believe Sanderson injected new life into a series that I was beginning to get sick of. When I mentioned this to my mom, who has been reading WoT since she was my age and is a huge fucking nerd about it, she said, "It's worth getting through those books to be introduced to Brandon Sanderson." Taking this cue, I immediately bought the *Mistborn* trilogy and T*he Way of Kings* upon finishing *A Memory of Light*.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few chapters of *The Final Empire/Mistborn* are rather slow, in my opinion. Which I love. It's not so slow that the reader is put off to the books; instead, Sanderson makes the pacing just right that when the story begins to gain momentum, it **really** gains momentum. The main thing that I loved about this book is how Sanderson takes fantasy and literary tropes and completely turns them on their head. For example, it's fairly obvious that Kelsier's going to die at some point in this book based off his charismatic personality. But when he does, and the crew begins to contemplate giving up, it genuinely seems like there's no hope. Then, Kelsier's grand plan is revealed. That was the first time I became seriously impressed with Sanderson's plotting skills. He kept placing hints of this outcome throughout the series overtly enough that they stick in the reader's mind, but subtly enough that the reader won't be able to figure out the plan until the final piece falls into place. I also love the internal dialogues of each character. It's very easy for the reader to understand how Vin's feeling, even though she doesn't quite understand herself. Her arc is probably one of my favourites of any character in Fantasy. Overall, it did a great introduction to the world, and despite the large scale of the novel's conflict, it did a fantastic job at setting up an even larger conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Wells of Ascension* is a delight from start to finish. There was absolutely no point in this book where I was bored, or confused. It's not my favourite in the series, but I do find it to be more consistently enjoyable than the other two (even though they're all quite enjoyable). Elend's transformation is one that I became utterly fascinated with. I actually brought up to my British Literature professor how Elend slowly changes from a character in a courtly-romance story (albeit a shitty one) to a Beowulf-esque king. Plus, it runs parallel to Vin's identity crisis. The first book touched on this, and I was so happy to see that this book would take a more in-depth look into Vin's psyche. I love how it gets more objective, as we begin to get a view of Vin from people other than herself. Yes, Kelsier did give us that at times, but not to this extent. Not only does it force the reader to question Vin's sanity even further, but it acts as a way to build Elend's character. When they learn to trust each other completely, and realize that it's okay to lean on each other, I legit melted. Plus, Sazed's story. I didn't mention him when I spoke on the first book, but Sazed is hands down my favourite character in this series. In this book he became one of my favourite characters in general. He's a badass scholar/steward, what more do you need me to say? The one aspect of the book that I didn't like was that Sanderson seemingly forced Sazed into a romance that I kind of thought was unnecessary, but upon seeing how it changed his character I immediately got over those reservations. It really helped hit home the darkness that comes over Sazed at the end of the novel. Speaking of the end, it gave me chills. I like how it was basically a giant middle finger to the reader. Yeah, you know pretty much all the revelations that came about in this book? They were bullshit! Somehow, Sanderson managed to up the scale on this whole thing once more.

&amp;#x200B;

And with that, we move on to *The Hero of Ages.* The beginning of this book was epic. That's not hyperbole; that whole battle with the koloss was incredible. Battle hardened Elend sucked me right into this book. I've always liked Elend, but this version of him made me respect him even more. Vin doesn't change that much, and I like that. Her plotline in the second book was satisfying, and to see her fall from that immediately would have been a little upsetting. She's confident, yet not arrogant. Her instincts are well-honed, but she isn't paranoid. This is the version of Vin that she's supposed to be. Sanderson left some loose ends to be tied up in this book, which I like, since it gives her at least some upward movement for the reader to enjoy. The ball chapter is so much fun. I found Yomen to be an excellent foil to Elend. He's not really a foil at all, but Sanderson certainly sets him up to be one at first. As the two converse, the layers are slowly peeled back, and you begin to realize how similar the two are. There is a small period in the middle of this book that I found to be slow. That is mitigated once the story begins to come to a close. Like I said earlier, Sanderson is really good with placing subtle hints throughout this story. The way the pieces of the puzzle that he set up as far back as the first book begin slamming together into place, with a domino effect, astounded me. I was supposed to do some studying today, but I didn't get to it because I couldn't stop reading. Everything was unexpected yet felt right. I could go on about all the different revelations that came about, but I'll just list off my favourites to save time; the origin of the kandra, the identity of Preservation, how Vin can control the mists, and the army of atium mistings. I read the ending of this book on the bus, so my body wouldn't let me cry, but I felt like I was about to. Elend and Vin's deaths were sad, but inevitable. They both went out in ways that fulfilled their character arcs, so I wasn't as sad as I was proud. Then, came Sazed's moment. I couldn't be happier with the way this turned out. It was so obvious that Sanderson had been setting this moment since he introduced Sazed. Throughout the whole book, he has been convincing himself that all his religions are useless, and struggles with his identity as a keeper. Yet it is through his knowledge of religion that he is able to become the Hero of Ages and save the world, when no other person would be able to come close. And, he does it at his lowest moment. My emotions were all over the place when I read this part.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I left a lot out, and didn't explain myself as well as I could have, but I started writing this as soon as I got home from University, and I'm pretty tired and hungry lol. I knew that I was going to like this books from the get-go, but didn't expect to like them this much. I'd like to read the sequels that Sanderson wrote for this book, but if I never get around to doing that then I'm completely satisfied with the ending we were given. Sanderson is truly a master.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; this book series is fucking incredible, 10/10 would bang

Favorite Rand romance? So my brother and sister and I were staying up late a while back discussing WoT (as one does) and we realized that we all have a different favorite girlfriend for Rand: I like Min, she likes Elayne, and he likes Aviendha.

I loved Min from the very beginning; she has one of the most unique abilities in the books and is the most loyal to Rand imo.

Which one is your favorite and why?

Why do many people hate WoT? I just finished fires of heaven for the first time and all this new hype around the series is really exciting. However, I have noticed a lot of people have a really bad impression of the books. I recently saw a Twitter post by  a handle that is normally very sane call it  "one of those bloated 90s fantasy series." I'm really surprised by this since I think the writing and world building have been excellent so far! Would be really interested to know what everyone thinks about all this!

What Romances do you keep for TV show? WoT seems to have romantic interests for every character. With streamlining for TV, which ones do you think they will keep and which are more or less able to be cut with minimal impact to the characters drives?

IMO:
For the main 5 from TR,
Rand: Keep the interests in Elayne, Avienda, and Min, but make them series relationships instead of parallel (the polygamy thing won't translate well to TV, imo)
Mat: Keep Tuon (this is a must for me)
Perrin: As much as I dislike Faile, the relationship is Perrins primary driver and motivation in the series, so you have to keep it.
Egwene: Dont need the love interest storyline. It's so minor to her character development
Nyneve: On the fence. I liked her relationship with Lan, but I don't think you lose that much by removing it from the TV series. My guess is they will keep it though.

Problems going back to Wheel of Time? So, this is my first post and I just recently discovered this haven and I'm extremely excited. I love Malazan and I've read through MT and also NoK. So far MT has been my favorite. However, I'm reading the series with my best friend who sometimes doesn't have time to keep up with me and I really need somebody to talk to about events in the series. So, in order to keep my reading rhythm up I decided I would try to get back into Wot(I read through Fires of Heaven).

I did not expect it to be as difficult as it's been. I can't decide whether I've become used to Erikson's superb writing or if I just suddenly hate Jordan's painfully slow style. I really love Wot and the idea so I think I'll definitely come back once I'm done with Malazan but I was wondering if any of you have had this same issue with other series, though particularly Wot. I just find some of the characters in Wot horribly annoying and badly written, especially the women in the books.

To which fantasy subreddits do you subscribe and why? Do you moderate any? Here’s a list of fantasy-related subreddits: r/Fantasy/wiki/subreddits

Besides r/fantasy, I’m subscribed to r/lotr, r/tolkienfans, r/Malazan, r/Discworld, and r/WoT.  I’m a moderator at r/Malazan.

I’m a long-time Tolkien fan, and I also love absurdly-long fantasy series like *Discworld*, *Wheel of Time*, and *Malazan*.  I particularly like the *Malazan* series, which I have read four times and counting (the fourth time on audio).  I never seem to tire of discussing it.

WoT TV: Controversial Cuts and plot changes When dealing with a TV show, and a 14 book series, we know that many, many cuts are going to have to take place, condensing books, moving around plot points, combining characters, etc etc. This is inevitable and people are going to have to just deal with it.

There are a few things that I think MOST reasonable people can agree on. Elayne's throne succession can be literally accomplished in one sentence for TV purposes (she rides into Caemlyn and becomes queen, the end) and regular audiences won't know the difference.  Perrin's wanderings, Faile's capture are both much maligned.  There are so many pages dedicated to Aes Sedai machinations with characters we don't care too much about that those can be pretty much eliminated.  The focus is going to be on the Two Rivers kids + Moiraine and that's kind of the way it should be.

However there ARE things that are going to hit the cutting room floor that fans are going to lose their minds over. What are some things that YOU think you would cut that other fans will be upset about?

I'll get controversial:

The Horn of Valere. It is too powerful, too much of a Deus Ex Machina.  TV audiences always be able to say "Well why not just get the Horn of Valere? Why have it sitting in a warehouse? It makes no sense." I also think visually, it would be hard to achieve with out it a) looking cheesy and b) being a complete copout. Its definitely high fantasy stuff that Post-Got viewing audiences will have a problem with. Yes, this creates a chain reaction that could have far reaching consequences. No more Mat as the Hornsounder. It would be Birgitte's existence as a character.  At best, I think it is something that needs to be thought out and reworked.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure that will set people off and I don't want this to focus exclusively on that, but discuss away.

And what major element would you discard that could upset Wotmaniacs?

Completely stonewalled on book 9 I'm reading through the WOT series for the first time and I threw myself headfirst into it. I was getting through each book within a week, but I've been on book 9 for the last four months. I don't know why, but it feels like such a slog to me this time around. I hear Mat comes back in this book, which is awesome since he's probably my favorite character, but I'm almost halfway through and I haven't seen him yet.


Is it worth it to power through? Should I take a break?

Does WoT stop being a Lord of the Rings clone? I'm sorry if this is commonly asked, but I'm wary of searching for an answer because of spoilers. I'm only on the first book and I'm not really that far in yet, but I really seems like this is heading down the LoTR clone territory. Does this eventually change? I'm assuming with 15 books, it has to eventually, but for now I just feel like I've already read this before. I do think the world sounds intriguing though.

Just finished Eye of the World (Cliche post title? Perhaps!) I know this is a popular topic, but I had to make a post because no one in my friend or family group reads fiction/fantasy...

Big fan of fantasy and somehow never got around to WoT, but after re-reading LOTR a few months ago, I had the urge to continue on to another "classic" fantasy series. I was deciding between WoT and Malazan and after reading tons of reddit threads, decided to go with WoT (but planning to read Malazan next).

Anyway, I really enjoyed the Eye of the World. I think like many of us have thought or heard others say before, there was a lot of similarity to LOTR - dragkhar=nazgul, Moraine=Gandalf, I was even slightly annoyed at first that Mat and Perrin were so similar in names to Merry and Pippin...but I quickly got over all of it because I was swept up into their story and couldn't help but page turn to find out where it went next.

A little about me: I read fantasy for the adventure and escape - I don't over-analyze the plot/characters/etc. for the most part, I simply read it in the hopes of being entertained and in this case, I was very entertained.

Was the book a little longer than it had to be? Perhaps, but what fantasy book isn't :P

Did things just sort of happen for Rand in a convenient sort of way? Perhaps, but again, that's usually the case in this genre.

All in all, I really enjoyed the characters, the creative world Jordan has started to take us through and the storyline itself. Very excited to get started on the Great Hunt tonight, I just wish I was a faster reader...

To those who haven't read WoT but are thinking about it, my recommendation is definitely to give it a read and find out for yourself. It's right up my alley and I'm very excited to read the rest of the story. Would love to hear any other insight into the 1st book or (non-spoiler) future books ahead of me.

Cheers!

Home brew 5e wheel of time angreal ideas Hello all,
I want to run a wheel of time campaign homebrew (5e mechanics) following the main storyline,
Just asking for some advice if anyone knows, how could I make angreal (or magical items) for players to use that don’t channel the one power?  I was thinking taking some of the dnd items but I wanted something that would suit the wot universe and are actually in the wot books if possible, for example the fox head medallion and powerwraught weapons (+1s etc). But all the other angreals etc need a channeler to use? Anyone have any ideas?
Also mechanics wise how would an angreal work with channellers, it is meant to increase their power so does this give them additional weave levels or?

Cheers in advanced guys!

This was probably posted before (haven't been able to find it), but does anyone else see HUGE similarities between the wheel of time and the stormlight archives? There are so many common themes here. The ways in WOT is essentially Shadesmar. The forsaken in wheel of time are Sandersons version of the unmade. All the oaths and ideals being thrown around in each series. Theres just so much while reading the wheel of time that I look back on stormlight and think "damn, Brandon really used a lot of the same themes". Both series are great in their own way though.

Authors/artists finishing their work and Wheel of Time TLDR: Pat was right, authors need to take notes and pass on series. Wheel of Time is a great.

So on the most recent podcast (EP 267) the guys were talking about authors finishing or not finishing a long running series. Pat mentioned Wheel of Time. I gotta say that series is the PERFECT example of why you write down your story and leave it for someone else to finish if you know you are running out of time.

A minor thing, Pat was (surprisingly) wrong it wasn't Robert Jordan's son that finished the series, he might have mixed that one up with Dune and Frank Herbert. Instead they handed off the series to Brandon Sanderson, who may be the best fucking fantasy writer of this generation. No seriously, he's god damn incredible. I'd note I'm still on book 9, but from what I've heard when Sanderson was given the reigns to Wheel of Time he wrote what has been said to be the best three books of the series.

For those who aren't familiar with Wheel of Time, its a series which is famed for having characters which can get a little annoying sometimes, and a writing style which can be overly descriptive. But Robert Jordan knew how to have fucking finales. Like giant kaiju battles, huge wars, a villain getting murdered so hard that he dies back in time, a character turning from a dunce into Domino with a cool scarf, betrayals, action, maybe a harem (we don't like to talk about that one). Then we mix that with Brandon Sanderson, who can make a man running around with a bridge into the most compelling shit in the world.

In terms of what we got out of it, it was the best of both worlds. The series ended in a really satisfying way. I think it solidified Robert Jordan's legacy in a way I think he genuinely deserved. And it successfully passed the baton to the next generation of fantasy authors in Brandon Sanderson. Most series probably won't turn out as good as WoT did, but I'd think we'd all agree that its better than a series getting rushed to conclusion or being left inconclusive.

Toradora! Rant I'd like to start off by saying I have never watched a show that has shortened my life expectancy more than this one. I decided to watch this show thanks to a certain flow chart served up to me by a bot of this very subreddit ([https://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q](https://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q)) According to this flowchart, Toradora! is a C O M E D Y ?? Hell0. wot, how is this even possible. I started this show hoping for a light hearted comedy, but instead i've suffered for the past two days grueling over the most complex love pentagon ever. I couldn't sleep bro, I was questioning why every character did what they did and why, and it wasn't entirely due to poor writing, it was very realistic but there was no proper warning or foreshadowing for what was to come... Ever. This leaves the viewer in the difficult position of not knowing who to root for at any given point. The intended ship is constantly changing, or rather there is no intended ship. It's almost as if the writers themselves forgot what the actual ship was supposed to be until the second last episode.


Because of this, I believe that zero percent of viewers walk away from this show feeling 100% satisfied, and that's truly unfortunate. There are so many good moments in this anime, and the characters are well developed for the most part. I would have been a bit more okay with the ending personally if they did a better job pushing the preferred ship. By episode 20-23 I'd say the audience is just confused, if you don't believe me just look at the comments on crunchy roll.

&amp;#x200B;

SPOILER WARNING FROM THIS POINT ON:

Okay, so let me try to describe how I felt as an audience member at each point in the series, and why that's not a good thing. From episode 1 on I just started to feel bad for Ryuji, from my perspective he was just being taken advantage of by Taiga. But then as the series goes on they seem to develop a familial bond as neither of them have a proper family. I was all for this and saw them as a younger sister / older brother duo. This feeling was only furthered by their respective crushes on the other characters and not each other. Ryuji had it bad for Minori, and Taiga had it bad for Yusaku. Since Ryuji was best friends with Yusaku and Taiga was best friends with Minori you had a very interesting double wingman dynamic going on. This in my opinion was the peak of the series, it only goes downhill from here.

&amp;#x200B;

So early on Taiga confesses her love to Yusaku and gets shut down. Tough, but he can handle it and still continues to admire him. But then here's where they mess up, they show a flashback scene where Yusaku confesses to Taiga and gets shut down himself. Hold on, what?? That changes everything bro. If you loved her 6 mo ago and she turns you down out of shock, but then develops feelings for you and comes back to you, you have to be sick to turn her down this time around. I get it, he's now interested in that side character president girl but that's not revealed until much later, and in the meantime I just perceived him to be an asshole. So where does that leave us?


Well there is no longer anyone good for Taiga, which is a problem since she is the main character. And my poor boy Ryuji can't happily go on with Minori because even though it is cannon that they both love each other there is the guilt that Taiga will be left alone. Kitamura is fine, there is not a girl in the school he couldn't pull at this point, and same goes for Ami. I believe in order to avoid screwing over the main character they last minute decided that Ryuji x Taiga is what they need to do and use their familial bond as an excuse to say "see, we've been planning it the whole time!" but it just doesn't feel right. Neither of them ever have a proper moment with either other until the finale.


For the record they did a half decent job with the ending and so I don't feel as bad about Ryuji x Taiga, but I just feel really sorry for all the other characters who have been dragged through the mud this whole time. Not sure if i've  properly voiced my opinion or not, but do feel free to let me know if you agree or if you can help me see the other side of the coin.

There's a WoT community on Reddit! I started WoT 13 years ago and I'm not finished as yet 😂. Even attempted it in another language (Chinese). It's nice to see a lot of people do find WoT interesting enough to join a subreddit. Favorite book is the first one I read "The Great Hunt", which I've read several times already. That was only because I was fairly new to reading as a hobby (out of school) and did not know that the book was a part of a series - image my delight when I found out.

I've read Star Wars, Gardens of the Moon and Lord of the Rings and I love them but The Wheel of Time is not only about love it's also about feelings. Jordan played on all my senses, captivated my mind and endeared my heart, providing an experience of a lifetime.

WoT series blademaster training better legit Not that I know anything about sword fighting but the grace, control and dexterity that comes through in the books is such an important part of those scenes. Capturing the mastery of a blademaster is going to take some incredible choreography and vision. Also I feel like it will need to look different than sword fighting we have seen historically, since this is a style of fighting so unique to the WoT universe.

I am not comfortable about the ... that is to come in WoT [Ending spoilers] I am still on the second book, after reading Min's prediction about Rand being shared and remembering that I once saw a thread of Min/Elayne/Third lady, who do you like best? I kind of just figured it on my own.

As a woman I am extreemly uncomfortable by this, the polygamy stuff I mean and totally not sure if I could continue, I can handle death, betrayel ..etc but honestly this is a sensitive subject.

Any other women here who can voice their thoughts on this?

Also keep in mind I have not read the entire series.

[SPOILER ALL] My big WoT Re-read I recently started a new re-read of the series which makes it the fourth complete read since the publishing of AMOL. I just finished EOtW and thought I share my impressions with you.

**Old Things**: I still don't like Mat and Egwene, I love Rand and Nynaeve and I'm neutral to Perrin.

Ingtar always seems a high level servant instead of a Lord on his first appearance.

I actually like how Lan and Nynaeve's relationship developes between lines.

**New things**: Mat already was kind of a jerk before the Shadar Logot dagger. Also, I didn't remember Perrin's struggle with leadership showed already in the first book (when the group get separated after Shadar Logot).

I always thought "child of the dragon" in the Green Man chapter referred to Rand's ability to channel but now I understand it refers to his aiel ancestry.

A lot of other things I don't remember just now.

REQUEST: Dungeon Mastering a campaign based on WoT and need some input! (SPOILERS for Eye of the World) Hi all! I've read and reread these books since I picked up The Dragon Reborn in the late 90s. As a result, when it was my turn to DM our DND group, I decided to set my campaign in the Wheel of Time universe. Now, of course I couldn't just do a 1:1 story with them, so I had to make some changes around their characters and the story progression. Also I had to incorporate a bunch of different races and creatures into the world.

The group consists of a male Teifling (decided to have his parents made a deal with the snakes/foxes and it influenced his appearance) Warlock, a female Elf (decided to make the Aiel into Elves just because Elves always seem to be the badasses of most fantasy worlds) Druid, and a male Human Fighter who was from a noble house in Tear.

The group just completed the climax of the first book where they found and utilized the eye of the world. I thought it went fairly well, but I made the mistake of railroading the group a little harder than I had planned to in order to make the story work around them. I plan on letting them have a little more freedom from this point forward. I think I will gently nudge them towards Tear in order to complete the Callandor arc, but other than that I want them to be able to explore.

The reason I am making this thread is to see if anyone has any thoughts for fun encounters or side quests that could come up on their journeys. For instance, I was thinking that the group could come across more and more Aiel on their journey while they look for the Car'a'carn and that could make for interesting interactions with the Druid as she is essentially a Wise One. Or if the story progressed far enough, they could encounter the village that goes insane at night or something.

Would also love some general discussion or thoughts about DND to WoT and vice versa.

TL;DR Would love random encounters/side quests from the Wheel of Time setting for my dnd campaign!

(Series) rereads and OMG the typos I've never really noticed it before, and that's probably because previous copies of the series I have owned were trade paperback editions, but it startles me how many typos can be found in WoT. I saw a post the other day about diagonal word misprints in ACoS. But just in general there are a smattering of misprints, not to mention a mistake found in tSR. Directly following the scene where Amys punishes Egwene for going into the dream against her word Egwene looks over in the tent and finds Moiraine's blankets emptied yet in the book it it clearly says Nynaeve's despite her being on a ship bound to Tanchico, Speaking of, has anyone ever noticed that tSR itself is misprinted in the early editions, having almost no margins?

I'm a collector and have the entire series in 1st edition except for tDR and tFoH which are later editions and of course my tEotW and tGH are the giant paperback first editions. I just noticed this and wondered if anyone else does. Also, for those seeking First Edition copies, I find KoD constantly at Dollar General stores.

Looking to start a long, epic fantasy series and came up with a list. Any recommendations? Haven't read any truly great fantasy in a while and looking for suggestions. What I've read thus far:

- LOTR trilogy along with The Hobbit, The Silmarillion and Children of Hurin

- All of ASoIaF - well up til book 5, which seems like it'll probably be the final one lol

- Caught up on Stormlight Archives

- Caught up on Kingkiller Chronicles

- Caught up on Gentlemen Bastards

- Read up to halfway through book 6 of WoT and have no plans to continue. Hated everything about the plot and characters starting book 3

What I narrowed my list down to:

- Realm of the Elderlings books by Robin Hobb. Top of my list right now, I've heard amazing things about them and I want to go through all of the various trilogies

- Malazan - I've read the first 3 and felt like MoI was a good endpoint. I keep hearing it gets even better but for some reason I never really continued

- Discworld - Never read one of these and I always see them brought up for funny, cozy reads

- Dresden Files - I like urban fantasy but I've heard some criticism that the series can be a little...neckbeardish, I guess? Open to having my mind changed though

- First Law Trilogy - not really a long series, I guess, but I know Joe Abercrombie has a bunch of other books set in the same universe and they seem to be fairly well-acclaimed

Which would you guys pick from the list?

My ultimate casting for the WOT series or movies With all the talk of Amazon making a series of the WOT I've been thinking about if money was no object, if I could use any person (dead or alive), who would I want in some of the major roles.

I don't have all the cast but here is who I like for some of the roles.

Grace Jones, from her 1980's heyday, as Sermirhage.  She was supposed to be dark &amp; beautiful, though sadistic.

Helena Bohnam Carter as Moghedien.  Pretty but not really beautiful.

William Holden as Samuel.  Nice looking but with a wicked scar.

Clarke Gable as Rahvin.  I know the body type isn't really right, but Clark was good looking and I could kind of see him having his pretties coo and simper at him.

Jason Momoa as Demandred.  Really good looking and I could see him being crazy and jealous.

Vivien Leigh or Ava Gardner as Lanfear.  Both were super beautiful raven haired goddesses.

Lupita Nyong'o as Tuon.  Dark complexion and beautiful.

Cathleen Turner as Graendal.  Pretty &amp; voluptuous.

Vigo Mortensen as Lan.

A really young Reese Witherspoon as Elayne.

I know this isn't a complete list but just sometimes how i think of the characters.

Oddly Satisfying: Re-read only the first and last WoT books... \[Spoilers\] I first began this series in 1993 and, like most of us, I've re-read the books several times. However, I only read the last book once. It represented the end of a very long, very important relationship I had over two decades that I wanted to savor it for a long time. Well, finding myself without a book last week, I picked up Eye of the World and thoroughly enjoyed it. Like catching up with old friends. I had thoughts of re-reading the whole thing and then realized that I've earned the right to skip ahead if I want to. So I picked up the last one. And you know what? It was such a good call. It was great to see lines in the last book that quoted the very first one word for word. When Rand hears about Egwene is the most poignant example. Anyhow, just wanted to share.

[Cosmere] New Info on Nicrosil Feruchemy So Brandon's online store was unloading some old WoT and Legion hardcovers earlier this year, and I took the opportunity to get in some cheap questions. (Book personalizations are temporarily closed for the holidays already, unfortunately. Big backlog and all, and these just arrived today.) The big one I got answered was something about medallions I had been wondering about since Bands of Mourning was released:

&gt;Pagerunner: When you tap the nicrosil portion of a medallion, will it run out over time? Or is it like a coppermind, where something discrete is taken, used, and returned?
&gt;
&gt;Brandon Sanderson: Good question! Like a coppermind.
&gt;
&gt;https://wob.coppermind.net/events/316/#e11247

With the recent news that Lost Metal was going to be delayed (possibly written between chunks of Stormlight Four, if Brandon has the time), I'm pretty excited to get this theory confirmed. It makes me think that the Investiture that nicrosil Feruchemy stores is more along the nature of Breath or spren, as opposed to something Kinetic like Stormlight.

So, yeah, I'm pretty pumped about this answer. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.

Game of Thrones should be to season 1 of WoT what LotR was to EotW As most fans know, EotW feels the most similar to LotR and traditional fantasy because RJ wanted to start off readers with something familiar, before slowly distinguishing his world and series once he had grabbed the audience.

But I think season 1 has to avoid feeling too similar to LotR, not only because a LotR show will apparently be premiering near the same time as WoT, but because LotR is not the familiar, comfortable standard audiences will be looking for in a fantasy TV series --GoT is.

So what I am saying is, we shouldn't worry too much if the first season of WoT has a lot of changes seemingly made to resemble GoT, as long as they are not to the story and characters, but more in the way the story is told: introducing multiple points of views and plot lines earlier, introducing and giving more screentime to existing secondary and tertiary characters  earlier, establishing the game of houses and court politics earlier... WoT actually has those elements, it’s just a matter of bringing them in earlier.

And it also doesn’t mean that the show must maintain the resemblance. As with the LotR influence in EotW, once the show gains an audience and is renewed, it can then start to become its own thing.

I think it would be great, for example, if once Bayle Domon is introduced in the second or third episode, the show kept following him at least as a C or D story, and then introduced the Seanchan in the middle of the first season through him. Also, after Elayne is introduced, the show could follow her instead of having her disappear until TGH, and show the going-ons in Andor and Morgase’s court through her eyes. Elaida can be established as an antagonist earlier, and we could see how Rahvin arrives and starts to gather influence and power. (This would require several forsaken to be freed at the same time instead of Aginor and Balthamel first, but that wouldn’t make a lot of difference in the long run). I also would enjoy a small Min subplot in season 1 —at least seeing her once or twice during her journey to Tar Valon instead of also having her disappear.

How would you describe the alars of the other characters in the book? I was having some fun thinking about the way people describe their alar in the books. I started wondering how other characters would describe theirs. How would you describe their alars based on their personalities?

Descriptions of alar in the book and what I think they mean

* Kvothe - My alar is like a bar of Ramston steel. His alar is sharp and powerful but also easily broken and shatters rather than bending.
* Devi - My alar is like the ocean at storm. Her alar is strongest when she is angry. She is unbeatable when she is furious (like Nynaeve in WoT).

I tried to make up some to fit the other characters

* Wil - My alar is like a mountain of stone
* Sim - My alar is like a piece of the desert sun
* Fela - My alar is like a falling boulder
* Mola - My alar is like a forest river
* Kilvin - My alar is like a well-oiled clock
* Elxa Dal - My alar is like a pillar of flame


Other ideas:

* My alar is like the winds of winter
* My alar is like a diving falcon
* My alar is like budding flower (WoT Saidar)
* My alar is like the roots of a tree

Arms and Armour of the Wheel of Time Was not sure whether to brand this as a spoiler, but I did anyway just to be sure. I am in the 5th book by now and being a historical reenactor, I like to think about all the arms and armour described in the books. Lets think about it a little. Point out the great stuff and the horrible stuff aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all: I love the bows! So many times in every Fantasy settings, bows are for the weak people, for women... In here, bows are shows as they should be, as a heavy weapon for a man that is hard to draw and requires a lot of training to be used! I absolutely love it that the Two River folk is shows as good archers with heavy bows which work great. It is show several times that boys in Two Rivers are trained as bowmen for hunting while older men still continue training, drawing heavy bows that Faile is unable to draw. I love this detail cause it is so real!


Swords: Swords are par for the course in every fantasy setting. I like that here, they are shows as a weapon not for everyone. Most people dont wear swords, it is a weapon with high skill ceiling and you have to know fencing to use it... That being said, I hate the training as shown in the Wheel of Times. The Forms. I am not sure what they are supposed to be, but fencing with a sword is all about leading your oponent, working with the blade. Having preset forms you switch between may sound good, but it would make anyone fencing like this a predictable oponent.
Also, duels with swords seem to take a long time in the books. They do not take a long time in real combat. It is told by master Lichtenauer that 3 blows are enough to kill anyone, delivered correctly. It is impossible to parry more than 3 blows in a row (chained, ofcourse) as you really cannot react fast enough. In the WoT, duels seem to last minutes. For that to be the case, there would have to be a lot of leading the oponent around, trying him out, even half a minute of intense combat is way too much with a sword as it takes about 3 seconds for one to kill the other.
Ofcourse I am talking about competent swordsmen here, with total noobs, anything could happen.


Swordbreaker: I think I know what he means by it. No. NO. It never worked, it was never used. It is a wierd experiment never ever used in history and especialy not in 14th to early 15th century Europe, which seems most of WoT is based on.

&amp;#x200B;

Quarterstaff: I love this in the book also. The quarterstaff is an English weapon and it is a dangerous one at that. Often in Fantasy, a staff blow is seen as something minor to be overlooked. In WoT, we can see Mat and Julius using the staff in combat with great effectiveness against multiple oponents, which could be realistic. It is much easier to use a staff against multiple oponents than it is to use a sword, for example.


Spears: The Aiel weapon of choice. I LOVE IT. The spear is the most used weapon of all times, used from the stone age all the way up to today where it evolved into a bayonet. It can be thrown, it can be used to stab with. It gives you a reach advantage. One thing I dislike about how spears are shown in the series is the spear Mat has. There could easily be a spear with a sword-like blade at the top, though I would call it a polearm of sorts instead of a spear. However, it is stated multiple times that he uses it more like a staff than a spear. Which wierd why exactly? In battle, polearms are used how you would expect. A steel thing on a long stick, you thump or stab people with the steel end. However, if you are using a polearm outside of a tight formation, it is used exactly how Mat is using it! As a staff with a sharp end. Oftentimes, both ends of a polearm were steel of some sort (having a steel spike of some sort at the end of a poleaxe or a halberd) as both ends are used to deflect and attack the enemy. A polearm is a better staff. But still a staff and not using the other end of it is not smart.
Spears were often combined with shields, they do not have to be two handed! Just look at the Romans or the Greeks! I like that at least the Aiel are using them one handed. Even tough the Aiel weaponry seems much closer to Zulu than to anythine european.


That brings me to... SHIELDS. Where are they? There is barely a mention of shields. Why did noone have shields during the battle in Two Rivers? They all had polearms! They would probably just be ran over by the trollocs. Shields were heavily in use until very good armour made them obsolete for infantry. But I feel like the Two River folk could really use some against the trollocs...


Pikes: There are mentions of Tar Valon pikemen... which brings me to... Where are the other pikemen? If Tar Valon managed to find out a 5 metre stick is better than 2 metre stick, why is not everyone using pikemen? Cavalry should be in decline if someone figured out long sticks to counter it, but it seems that everyone else is relaying on cavalry still. Especialy the Whitecloaks, which seems to be all cavalry. An army such as that would be impossible to keep, horses are way too easy to counter if you do not have support for them.


ARMOUR


This is where it starts to be... wierd. Most of the armour in WoT so far mentioned was some kind of plate-and-mail, whatever that means. Probably 14th early 15th century European then, which is nice. However, if that is the case, where are all the armour piercing weapons? Maces, warhammer, poleaxes? You need that to pierce plate. And also mail.


It also seems armour is taken as paper in the series. Mail armour is very effective, plate is another level above that. The fact that Perrin managed to kill three armoured whitecloakes in combat, then a few more, is just horrible missunderstanding of how armour works. He has a waraxe, which could be way more effective against armour than a sword. But still, killing Whitecloaks like this should not be possible. It is very hard to get around armour and almost impossible to do it against superior numbers without having armour aswell. The part when Perrin and one Aiel manage to kill an entire patrol is so wrong. They would get pounded to the ground, the Whitecloaks having barely been scratched. Armour is that effective... It just is.


Which brings me to: Light armour. There is none in these books. Where are the gambesons? Where is the Whitecloaks get the funds to have every single soldier in plate and mail? Those things were incredibly expensive, it is very unrealistic that everyone would wear it. Noone would have money for that. And if it was that cheap, everyone would have it and wear it in case of a riot or something. Especialy in a world as war torn as this.


Leather armour: Does not exist. Does not work. Mostly missunderstood by Fantasy authors. Studded leather is bullcrap. What it actualy is are plates of steel studded to a leather jerkin which just holds it together, its called a coat of plates or a brigandine. Leather can be replaced by cloth. I think someone had leather armour in the series... but I could be mistaken.


Visors: Everyone may have good armour, but noone has visors. Why? Conical helmets of the Whitecloaks could be bascinets, why do they have their faces open? Wearing armour is good for nothing without having your face properly protected, as you can just be shot in the face or killed otherwise in the head. MORE VISORS.





So this was just my view on the weapons and armour so far. I like how it is shown. I like how the weapons are, I do not like how negleted armour seems to be. Any questions or points? I like discussion! Lets start one!

[Recommendation] Hi guys,
So I am looking for a new series to start and after some research I am thinking about:

\-Malazan the Book of the Fallen
\-Wheel of Time


So, I want something sort of big and that is already finished. Plus, although I mostly read books in English, this time around I am thinking about reading a book in Portuguese (I am Brazilian), so both series I mentioned are already being translated, which is a plus.


My question is, in your opinion guys, which series should I start? I have read reviews saying that WoT is the definition of a "flawed masterpiece" (I think the guy reviewer loved it but admitted there were problems...). And some people say that there are entire books that could be removed without any meaningful loss to the whole series.


I haven't really done a lot of research about Malazan's series, but judging from its goodreads score it should be at the same level of WoT. Personally I would prefer the one with more action and battles, basically the one that is more fast paced.


That is it, if this is not the place to post it, please let me know.
Additionally, pardon any mistakes I might have made (English is my second Language and as much as I would love to be have a perfect grammar, I know I make a few mistakes sometimes)

Another end, a New beginning So WoT is absolutely my favorite book series. I’ve read it through at least 4 times, and I want a change of pace so I don’t get tired of it. Does anybody have any suggestions for a new series? Similar to wheel of time preferably.

[meta] Is there a subreddit for the WoT TV show? Should there be? I think it would be good if there were a separate sub for the TV show specifically.  Not because I don't want TV show content here (I will definitely sub to both) but to prevent the inevitable spoiling of stuff by book readers who know what's coming (see r/thewalkingdead for an ongoing example) and also to prevent arguments/confusion over the book canon vs. TV canon, which we can assume will differ to some extent.

If it's a good idea, someone else do it... not it.

General opinion/discussion on the Wheel of Time. I read the entire WoT series 4 years ago and I do vaguely remember the story. I loved the whole series and how real the world felt to me, like I was transported there. But is it of common opinion that the middle few books, namely books 6,7,8, and 9 are very dry and stretched a little more than it should be cause I remember these books being very boring, especially after the first 5.
Also does anyone else think Brandon Sanderson entered the scene and brought a completely new feel to the books. I personally preferred Brandon Sanderson's writing and think he reinvigorated my interest in a series that would have got really boring if it had been stretched even further. (Yes I'm a Sanderson Fanboy.)

What are your opinions? Not only one these but about the series in general.

(No Spoilers) Audio Recommendation So it's been about 4 years or so since I finished all of  the books and i'm ready to start this great adventure all over again. This time though, my goal is to get my wife hooked on the WoT so we can enjoy the show together when it finally debuts. What is the best app/version of the audiobooks (or read-along) out there that has the best chance of getting her hooked?

Elantris This is mt first sanderson. I love it so far. The book is slow to start but it gave me a chance to get used to the world and understand it instead of giving me 10000 years of history in the first page. I'm currently on chapter 34. It feels like its heating up and im loving it. I love the storyline and the worldbulding. I love the idea of a marvel style universe in the form of the cosmere.  What should i look for? I plan to read Mistborn era 1 next,then way of kings, then Mistborn era 2 and then warbreaker and then 2-3 of stormlight archives.  I love the epic history of WOT and im on book 1 of that but i read to book 3 before so im looking forward to the epicness of the stormlight archives.  The only negatievs so far are character names and shallow characters e.g raoden being utterly perfect.

I tried to get into the first book in this series after finding this subreddit, but I can't get into it. Does it get better, and I just need to stick it out? or is this series just not for me? Pretty much the title. I love reading fantasy, and after one of my more recent re-reads of stormlight, I stumbled upon this subreddit, and decided to get Gardens of the Moon at my local library. I was fairly interested at first, the murder plot being set up seemed different from what I was used to, and the initial character batch was fairly enjoyable, if a bit mundane. The magic system was weird and non-descript, but I was ok with that, WoT didn't really explain channeling until a couple books in. What really killed my interest though was the location shift. Not that everything was great before then (the bridgeburners plot kinda seemed to be going nowhere, and hairlock's deal is something that really needed to be at least slightly explained). Tattersail was still enjoyable to me, although she was really just being pulled arround by other characters. I liked Paran, but he gets almost no time to himself, and the gods and magic system are so vague that its no really clear what the  hell happened in the near-death moment, or why just any sword he picks up can  kill magic death hounds. But i was fine with all that. Now we're in a new setting, only slightly related to the main plot, wherein there's a bunch of new characters getting involved in some politics. Not that I hate politics, but its a weird shift. not to mention that there is yet another oddball character whose personality and powers rely on the magic of this world, which we still don't understand, another character with near no personality (Rallick or however you spell it im not checking), and another young guy learning how to act in his life, despite corkus already being fairly experienced. I still don't hate any of it, but its alot to slog through when I could be off reading a hitchikers guide to the galaxy (got it from the library on the same day). So I guess my question is this. Is there some big payoff coming, or is it going to be like this for another 400 pages? I'm fine with waiting for something good, but if its too long coming I might just give up and go read something more enjoyable. Thanks

Readers companion for a re-read I'm looking to re-read WoT, and thus don't care about spoilers. I recently listened to the audio book of New Spring, which I did never read originally, it was a good warm up. But I plan on re-reading the series, not listening to the audio version.

What is a good resource for characters, races and lore etc? I'd like to get the most out of a re-read, as I suspect I missed a lot of subtle details during my first read, which I finished a few years ago. Reading some of the posts on this sub-reddit is making me home sick for the world of WoT..

New Wheel of Time Podcast Hi there! A last week a few of you expressed a passing interest in my new podcast.

It's called Stuck on Arrakis and I am currently reading WoT for the first time, podcasting about each book as I go. The Eye of the World episode went up yesterday if you guys want to check it out...

You can click here for the direct download: https://www.buzzsprout.com/209222/837449-eye-of-the-world-by-robert-jordan.mp3?download=true

It's also on Spotify, Google Podcasts, and whatever you call Apple's podcast platform. Is it iTunes? Not sure...

A few quick notes... Spotify for whatever reason isn't pulling the correct audiofile so the silly intro music I'm so proud of won't play if you're listening there :(.

Also, if you decide to listen to the intro episode you'll notice I sound like I'm talking through a time can from 3 galaxies away, but I got a new mic so the second episode is much better.

This is the a true passion project for me and maybe some one will enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed making the new episode. I've never put myself out there like this before so if you have any suggestions for improvement I'd love to hear them.

Thanks for your time! :)

Should I Start Reading SA Now, or Wait I've read about 85% of Brandon's work, but I've purposefully avoided SA. I don't want to get in there and find myself stuck waiting a year and half on a cliffhanger or something.

I get the feeling that Brandon saw a little into how RJ engineered a large series like the WoT and felt he could do the same...then went in. Nothing wrong with that. But, I don't wanna start reading something that still has 10+ years ahead of it again.

But, BS is good at tying main plot points up on a book by book basis. So, is it okay to start now? Or should I wait for one more book or two to come out? What do you think. Can I read the first and then wait? Actually, what all is even out in the series right now? I'll have to look into that. I know there are two main books at least, and short stories here and there.

Yes, considering which sub this is, I already know what many of you think 😂 but I thought I would ask anyway.

Finished The Shadow Rising for the first time (Spoilers TSR) Oh Light! Now I know why this book is considered one of the best if not the best of the series! Totally amazing!

The beginning was just perfect. We had the drama about the "bubbles of evil" with an axe attacking Perrin, cards attacking Mat and mirror Rands attacking Rand. I'm not sure where is Jordan going with these bubbles of evil, but they always bring an action sequence to the story and I like action. Then there was Rand dealing with the nobles of Tear and I like that Rand is slowly becoming a leader of the masses. And then came the attack on the fortress and blood and ash was it epic! Rand wiping out everyone with a single stream of power was amazing! What an intro to a book!

Now let's talk about plotlines in this book. Perrin is without a doubt the biggest star in TSR. Getting back to Two Rivers, finding out his family is dead, uniting everyone to fight against trollocs, his relationship with Faile, the guy in the world of dreams (Is it Killer in English? I read in Czech so I don't know a lot of the English names). Everything just works so nicely and Perrin becomes an amazing character and currently he is my absolute favourite. And then they get married and he sends her away! And then there's the stunning Battle of Emond's Field! And Faile comes back and saves the day and the whitecoats want to take Perrin but all of Two Rivers stands up for him and its just incredible! I'm sad that Perrin is not at all in Book 5 (at least thats what I've heard).

Nyneave and Elayne's plotline is fairly good. We get a glimpse of the Atha'an Miere (I imagine we'll learn a lot about them later) and we are hunting black ajah in Tanchico. We also meet Egeanin who is a pretty interesting character. She's Seanchan but after meeting the girls she's starting to doubt her own principles and I thing she will play a big role in the fight against the Seanchan. Anyway, then we have the action in the palace and the best fight in the series so far for me. Nyneave vs. Moghedien. It was so well written, I was extremely hyped when reading it! And then a black ajah comes in and fires balefires at Nyneave, but she evades it and the black ajah dies! Oh damn! Also we get the tools meant to control Rand and another cuendillar lock. Just two remain to be found!

Tar Valon. The last chapter of it was... well I was speechless. In a few pages Siuan went from the most powerful woman in the world to a poor girl who can't reach saidar anymore. That moment she realised it I actually almost cried, it was so tragic! I hope she gets Elaida one day and she'll get her revenge! Anyway she and Leana escape with Min and we meet Gawyn. He was actually helping Elaida? He actually killed his teachers who wanted to free Siuan? Damn that's dark! The girls escape and they recruit Logain on the way and Min sees glory and fame in his future... excited to see what happens to this group!

And at last the Aiel Waste plotline. Honestly all the Rhuidean stuff was cool, but I was very confused by the Aiel history. But I actually already read the beginning of Book 5 now and there is a little summarization of it so now I get it. Mat's little plotline in this book is interesting, but I feel like it's stuck on one point for too long. He's getting memories from a distant past, he can speak the old language, but it doesn't actually go anywhere in this book, so after reading for Mat's perspective for the fifth time (since Rhuidean), still nothing really new happened to him and I stopped caring. Hopefully he will become more significant later. Then we travel a bit and we meet some random people and I'm like, is this neccessary for the plot at all? But after we get to Alkair Dale and Rand argues with Kuladin a bit and he is proclaimed The one who comes with dawn, we find out that those random people were two Forsaken! Then Rand fights Asmodean and we get answers to two mysteries from previous books, which I already forgot about, the black strings attached to Ba'alzamon and the big crystal ball next to Cairhien. Rand cuts off Asmodean from the Dark One and Asmodean becomes Rand's teacher. Well that's an unexpected turn of events! I knew Rand had to learn to use the power somehow, but didn't think it would be like this! I like it though. I'm a bit confused about Lanfear's goals as well, does she just want to seduce Rand and rule the world with him? Also I don't really like the fact that Forsaken are supposed to be the strongest and so far they've lost every single fight they were in. But there are many more and hopefully they won't go down so easily.

So in conclusion, easily the best book in the series so far and I'm very curious whether any book will actually beat it. Already started Book 5, I'll post again after reading it. I hope you find my posts interesting, I want to share my first experience of WoT with you :)

PS: So the Czech versions of WoT have some weird book covers on some books. I already showed you Book 2 which had a guy from Malazan on its cover. Now [here's the cover of Book 4](https://cdn.knihcentrum.cz/6923204_stin-se-siri.jpg). It's made by some guy who illustrates for fantasy, but this one not made for WoT as far as I know. However, lets pretend it was, who do you think this illustration depicts?

First rime reader (listener) and looking for some non-spoiler glossaries and maps to supplement my experience I drive a lot for work as I support various sites throughout a region, so I started using Audible after being highly recommended by a coworker. Since February I've gone through the entire Dark Tower series for my second time (actually read it the first time), IT (over 1,000 pages on its own), Under the Dome (another long King novel), and another random short book.  So I thought, "Hey, let's start The Wheel of Time."

Now as much as I have surprisingly enjoyed audiobooks, I'm a more visual person.  Having not previously read these books, some of the names and places all sound alike or just sound like gibberish to me without having a visual of the name/place being said in my mind...if that makes sense.

Normally I'd just turn to Google, however I'm attempting to avoid spoilers, and read in the comments on another post from a WoT newbie that they are hard to avoid online. Does anyone have a links or references to a place that has a map and names of the characters? At least mostly spoiler free? Thanks everyone! Looking forward to diving into this series...the first audiobook is right around 30 hours and I'm 4 hours into in less than 24 hours haha!

How is WoT audiobook for first time readers? I’ve been wanting to pick up WoT for a while, I bought the first 3 novels over a year ago but have been ticking other fantasy novels off my list. I have quite a long commute every day and thought maybe I should try my first audiobook.

Would I ruin WoT for myself by listening rather than reading?

Help me with material for my stage combat class? Best sword fight with dialogue? I've only read the series once....well one and a half, having read it halfway from '92 til about 99, as books came out, then waiting til the whole thing was finished, and starting over from the start; so I'm not as familiar with all the detail that lots of you multi-readers are....

My second major use of my time - besides work - is a lot of acting, in community theater, short films, and now a series in the making; and taking classes to always expand my toolbox and improve my skills.

I'm currently taking a class in broadsword/longsword "fighting" for the stage - it's how to look very convincingly like you're trying to kill each other, at high speed, with cool simulated attacks and defenses, while actually not attacking each other in any way. :D

We've learned all the physical techniques and practiced them for weeks.  Now we're learning the choreography for the certification test.  The second aspect of the fight we'll be doing is to intersperse it with acting.  We've been assigned to pick a sword fight scene from a play, movie, or other published literature.  We're going to overlay the character relationship and dialogue over our choreography that will show all the various physical techniques (https://www.safd.org/train/training-with-the-safd/spt-required-techniques/#broadsword).

What's the best physical fight scene *with some dialogue* in WoT?  Sword fight if possible, but alternately I can use any sort of armed physical fight and just overlay it on a sword fight.  Banter during some fight between Aiel?  Perrin and his hammer against some Whitecloaks?

Our fight has three "phrases" to it, so we clash with multiple attacks and defenses, then separate; then clash again, with multiple attacks/defenses, then separate; then again a third time.

Come on /r/WoT: Help me bring one pivotal moment into physical artistic expression on stage!

P.S. - Is there any chance that any WoT Redditor is a scriptwriter by trade?

Help me decide what’s next So I just finished **Priest of Bones** by Peter McLean, which I highly recommend if you like anything like Peaky Blinders, and I need to decide what to read next. I have all of these options already on my Kindle from various sales, I just don’t know what to read first. The options are;
1) **The Cradle Series** by Will Wight
2) **The Wolf** by Leo Carew
3) **The Eye of the World** (and probably all of WoT afterwards
4) **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** by Andrew Rowe
5) **The Dragonbone Chair** by Tad Williams (and the rest of the series afterwards)

At this point I've gotten three people to start reading wot. So far one has finished the whole series and loved them.

The second friend bought all the books and is slowly working through book 4 at this point.


And I just got a longtime friend to start book one and she finished it in 2 days. Now she's already starting book two with lots of questions.


These books mean so much to me I recommend them more than anything and I'm always trying to get new people to try the books out.

And secretly I just love telling others to RAFO, lol.

I'm also on a re read of this most brilliant of all stories and I can't seem to get enough of it.

What are some of your favorite things about the story and do you actively try to get others to read?

Bonus topic - who's excited about the new show?

Elantris and hoid : no spoilers for other cosmere! Hi. I am a first time reader of sanderson.  I read Eye of the world and looked into WOT more and heard of him through there.  Im so glad i discovered him. Elantris is flipping awesome. Mistborn is my next cosmere objective. Im going in published order/ the order of the cosmere deep dive podcast.

Anyway, I've just read the hoid part pf Elantris so nearly at the end. Now, I've heard hoid is an important cosmere connection. My qs are 1) what does hoid have to do with elantris. He's in it for like 5 mins
2) whys he so important ( without spoiling the rest of the cosmere)

3) how do i find cosmere connections in elantris? Is it important to the cosmere? How do i know what to look for in Mistborn and future novels or is it simply a case of finish all the cosmere books, then research it with spoilers and re read the books?

Thanks

Started this epic journey a week ago, nearing halfway point of The Eye of the World... ...and I was told in a comment last week that people here like to live vicariously through others first experiences with WoT. So I will try to share my current thoughts here throughout the series.  With that being said:

I enjoy the idea behind Lord of the Rings, I realize it's a classic, but I simply can't do those books. They bore me. The movies even halfway bore me, but the story is a fantastic, epic journey, and I appreciate that. This series so far, partway through the first book, reminds me of a fast paced and readable LotR. I love it.

Our merry band of eight travelers are currently attempting to escape Shadar Logoth and the Mashadar, trollocs, and fades. Ultimately, I'm sure I know very, very little about the characters so far. However, my only real thought right now is that Mat is an idiot. I try to keep in mind that these boys are from a sleepy farm town and (I assume and imagine) 16-20 years old range, but c'mon. Rand and Perrin both had enough sense to not want to follow the creepy dude into the dark basement for treasure. Mat, I know you're from a town where everyone knows everyone, but didn't your parents teach you not to take candy from the stranger in the van?

That's all I have for now.

Just finished the series Haven’t really posted here much, but I finished the series. If that isn’t worth a post, nothing is.

Man, what a ride. Wow!

I’m still processing it all. Favourite moment is still the “I win again” scene from book 2, but my favourite Last Battle moment was probably when Noal showed up, or Gawyn’s death.

I’m also positively surprised in how much fun Mat &amp; Tuon was to read.

But the whole thing was just wow. The world was so alive, I even think that the worldbuilding in the middle made the end so powerful.

I’m definitely taking a break from WoT for a while, after which I’ll read New Spring. Looking forward to it already.

I will reread it at some point.

My problem with the WoT world So I've read the WoT series three times now, I love it, one of my favorite series of all time. However, does anyone else feel that some of the harsher edges have been dulled? For instance if you look at the worlds created in GoT or the King Killer Chronicles it seems to me that they are more realistic, dangerous, and raw. Really though that's my only complaint in an otherwise flawless series. Let me know your thoughts, or if you disagree enlighten me to why i'm wrong! Looking forward to your responses and happy reading!

[Spoilers All] How would the community feel about introducing late-game players earlier in the television adaptation? So there has, of course, been a lot of discussion about the Amazon WoT adaptation. One thought that's stuck with me is that while LotR was the standard for epic fantasy in literature--and as such, EotW is modeled after it--Game of Thrones is the standard for fantasy adaptations to television, and our show could take a lot of cues from it.

What's one thing that Game of Thrones has right off the bat, an aspect of the plot that WoT excels at later in the series, but (intentionally) ignores early on?

Scope.

How do you think it would affect the story if the Wheel of Time adaptation included characters like Tuon and Demandred (as Bao the Wyld) earlier than they appear in the novels? This would give us an insight into goings-on on all three major continents, and really expand the world. We could see Tuon consolidating power in Seanchan and becoming the favored heir--maybe her final scene before she departs for Randland could be her officially being declared Daughter of the Nine Moons?

Similarly, we could introduce Bao in a more ambiguous role. The River of Souls plot could be adapted and we could see Demandred as the savior the people of Shara saw him as. We could drop some insidious hints throughout his plotline about his identity, but really play up the idea that he wants to preserve the Sharan people and save them from the destruction the Dragon Reborn will bring.

Obviously I love this story and I would not change anything. But in adaptation, there is always, well, *adaptation* of ideas that are present in the source material. I think introducing these characters earlier (not *too* early--maybe Tuon can enter in the season they adapt TGH, so we see the sympathetic side of the Seanchan before their attack at Falme? I think Lord of Chaos would be a good point to introduce the Bao storyline, not because of the Taimandred controversy, but because of Graendal destabilizing the Sharan government and the rumors of unrest that Rhuarc talks about) can help flesh out the world in a visual medium. It can give us a three-pronged view of the end of times from the perspectives of three vastly different cultures (four including the Aiel, who are already a large part of the main arc).

It would also provide some ambiguity about the morality in the series. Light and Shadow are integral to the story, but so is the idea of alternative evil--the evil represented by *Daes Dae'mar*, by the Whitecloaks, by Shadar Logoth, by slavery. Tuon's storyline could show us the good in Seanchan society, but still be worrying because her nation would be attacking Randland before ultimately siding with the Light. Similarly, Bao could provide us with a charismatic figure that seems good, but has a vastly different outlook than our main characters with regards to the Dragon and is ultimately revealed as a leader of the Shadow.

I really like the idea from some users here that WoT should take inspiration from GoT's production. I know it's not the best show nor book series--I prefer WoT by a mile, even though I do thoroughly enjoy ASoIaF--but it *is* the standard for fantasy television. Early Wheel of Time intentionally took cues from what was proven to work and what was familiar, and I think the show could do the same. Game of Thrones has action on two continents from the very beginning, and Dany's character is disconnected enough from the main plot that her character is really ambiguous at times (what is she going to do when she gets to Westeros? Will she become a Mad Queen? etc.). WoT *also* has characters that could fill this role, and I'm curious to see if the fans would enjoy an alternative take on the story we all know and love.

[SPOILERS] New Spring New Reader read order Hey Folks!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've only ever listened to the aubilble books, and reading them is on my list for next year, so pardon my spelling of names/places.

&amp;#x200B;

My buddy (lets call him T) and I have been huge fantasy fans.  I  mean big time.  We were reading Game of Thrones and were Uber fans before the second book came out.  Somehow we both missed the WoT boat.  I found it a few years ago, and haven't yet gotten T into it yet.  I'm planning on getting him EotW for Christmas, but am wondering if he should read New Spring first.

&amp;#x200B;

I found out about NS after finishing the series, and after LOVING the books, it helped with the withdrawals.  That being said, i cant really remember, but are their major plot spoilers in NS?   I saw a recent post saying to read it around Shadow Rising/Fires of Heave/Lord of Chaos.  Is this so you can still get the initial introduction to the world mechanics/OP/Aies Sadia via EotW, TGH, TDR?

&amp;#x200B;

When I did my first re read i started with NS.... but I'm not sure that's the best intro to WoT for a first time newbie.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

Elantris first time reader review and theories i posted here the other day and people encouraged me to share my first time comments and theories about the cosmere. So Elantris was my first experience into the world of the Cosmere, and i flipping loved it!

&amp;#x200B;

People have complained that it is too slow but i personally disagree. I love rich and detailed fantasy worlds, but i cannot just be dumped into 10,000 years of history all at once! I loved how Elantris took it's time to build up it's world and move it's pieces into place. The magic although missing for a huge chunk of the book was intriguing, and i loved the idea of a fantasy book with a magic system, where there isn't much magic! The philosophical ways to it really interested me because i am a very naturally philosophical person. The religions, the politics, all of it felt real and rounded, and i felt a personal connection to it.  I loved the end fight and the little confrontations moments characters such as Hrathen and Dilaf got. i just loved the " nothing is ever for show" line. it made Hrathen feel like such a bad-ass!

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the not so good! First off, characters. few things here, the first being the names which were freaking annoying sometimes. Even my friend who read the book over my shoulder once said that the book looked stupid because of the names! Secondly, apart from a few characters such as Hrathen, Roial, and others, the characters didn't feel real enough to me, in the sense that they felt too perfect, in particular Raoden. They didn't feel like they had flaws, their plans almost always worked out, they came up with ideas out of nowhere which were perfect. Having said that, i did like the characters themselves, and i was invested in their story, it just felt like they weren't fully rounded.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, some of the plotlines e.g. Dilaf's seemed to heavily signposted for me, whilst others felt not foreshadowed enough. Maybe it was just me, and a reread would change it, but i didn't have a clue about why the Dor stopped working, and i felt like as a reader, i should have been able to have enough clues there to at least have a theory. Just a minor thing there though.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the Sanderlanche as i believe it is known by. For me, the book had a lack of action which was absolutely fine, because it was by its story a very political narrative, almost in a Game of Thrones politics style of fantasy. However, i felt the ending, although it had a lot of payoffs, and the action was cool ( although i thought it could have been a better more thought out battle rather than utter chaos, although i understand the whole idea was it was demonic chaos) , it came out of nowhere. It went from about 20-100 real quick for me. It went from political maneuverings and the threat of something big about to happen to demonic creatures running around and all out war. For me it just went up a little too fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for theory times. As I've said, i am new to the Cosmere so i don't really have any knowledge/ theories. The only thing i know so far is about Hoid. Now he turned up in Chapter 58, under his own name. Now he seemed concerned when Sarene talked to him and reassured him. This leads me to consider whether he had a stake in the fortunes of Elantris and the Aerlish throne. What his end game is, i do not know and i have no theories. I know nothing except that he is a character who turns up in other worlds. What theory i do have is how he gets between worlds. The pool in Elantris seems to be quite important, and it is never quite explained. Pools are often used as portals though, and this is seemingly a magical pool. I am wondering if that is how he got into Elantris and travels between worlds, via pools?

&amp;#x200B;

Overall i loved the book, and the graphic audio was great too. Although there are some flaws, i believe these may be ironed out in future novels. His experince of WOT seems to have changed him for the better is what i've heard. Next i read Hope of Elantris, and then Mistborn trilogy 1!

&amp;#x200B;

See ya then for more theories and feel free to have spoiler free discussions with me too!

Potential undesirable ending for the story [danger of Wheel of Times parallels] I really hope the Stormlight Archive will not take the same direction as the Wheel of Time did, with completely disappointing motivations and finale (i.e. completely black-and-white character division). For now we see Odium as “for the evulz” Disney villain type, displayed as 100% evil, and the Radiants, headed by our favorite childkiller Dalinar, displayed as 100% good just because author says so. At this point I just don’t see any moral superiority for human side of the conflict at all (except for Kaladin; Kaladin is best boy). It just feels like the author is forcibly trying to show that those who use white-glowing magic are good and those who use black-glowing magic are evil just because he says so. That’s where “show don’t tell” fails. Sanderson has built a beautiful world, but at this point I’m really hoping Odium wins, because I’m afraid that otherwise it will go full WoT with entirely disappointing ending (WoT spoilers: villains get defeated, happy end, the world happily goes back to inequality and feudalism, which is good because the cast is on top of society, no actual social problems get addressed).  I really believe Sanderson won’t do it and this is going to be great series, partially because in WoT our wannabe Hitler Elhokar would get a redemption ark, while in SA he got what he deserved.

[Cosmere] Twists So, I'm fairly new to Sanderson. The first thing I read from him was his WoT stuff about half a decade ago, but I didn't get into his own stuff until this year. I've read all the Mistborn books, and I've just finished The Way of Kings last night. I gotta say I love the books and I am thoroughly enjoying them and I have now started on the second Stormlight Archives book.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's one thing that is kinda bugging me after thinking about it for a while. The twists. Hot damn there's a lot of them. Like, it becomes kinda predictable with his books there will be a twist. I usually don't figure out what the exact twist is but it's getting pretty glaring that they're coming after reading a few of his books.

&amp;#x200B;

As an example because I just finished it, by my current count there are \*five\* big twists in TWOK.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sadeas' betrayal.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dalinar giving up his sword.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dalinar has a very one sided chat with his King (this one is a bit more arguable as a twist I admit but I feel like it counts)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Jasnah's secret about her soulcaster revealed

&amp;#x200B;

\- The kindly king turns out to be in charge of Szeth and is doing all the death notations throughout the book.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I am not counting some other major plot points revealed at the end as twists, like Kaladin's choice to save the lighteyes, as that was pretty well foreshadowed and expected. Nobody, I think, was really under the impression the bridgemen wouldn't help them. Kaladin's sudden uptick in power was a bit more unexpected, but still wouldn't count it as a twist.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah. It feels like Sanderson is trying real hard to pull the rug out from under you, and then each time you get up to glare and yell at him he yanks it again. By pull number three I'm just sitting there going "You're gonna do it again aren't you? The moment I get up you're gonna pull it again. I know what you're doing. I get it. Don't pull it again." \*YANK\* "You motherfucker!"

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Just some thoughts I wanted to write down and see what others thought. Like I said I still really like the books but I feel he's overdoing it with the twists in the last 10-15% of his books.

What is love (in WoT)? (Lord of Chaos spoilers) So I'm reading Lord of Chaos on my way to reading this whole series for the first time. Please no spoilers beyond that point because I'm still reading.

I wanted to know what your thoughts are on love in this series? I have some mixed feelings on it personally. Jordan does a very good job at displaying the feelings of the characters and how powerful their feelings are for people. What I don't get is the WHY.

I ask this because I just got done reading when Egwene and Gawyn meet again in Caemlyn. Where they both, especially Egwene, express love for one another. I don't fully get it. Aside from a dream she got sucked in to and some hints there wasn't too much interaction between the two characters. At least not enough to be talking about getting married and living together. Or Min loving Rand is another example. The only love in this book that felt was built up  to was Faile and Perrin. Is this the Wheel's weaving or Jordan just not wanting to build up relationships?

Anything like Malazan and Stormlight Archives had a baby? Hey all,

Just finished Stormlight Archives after a bit of fantasy hiatus upon finishing Malazan (I binged it lol).

So, I love Erikson's dialogue, but the way the characters are presented really makes them feel like props to plot, and Erikson tends to wind his way around a bit. I will say Karza's introduction is probably one of the best pieces of fantasy I've ever read, not to  mention Tehol, etc.

On the other hand, Stormlight has amazing pacing and structure. While it could be edited down, the pieces make sense where they are at very well. Everytime I finished a chapter, I was impressed that it felt like it was the right time for a new chapter.

One thing that bugs me about Stormlight is how weak the dialogue feels in comparison to Malazan; Sanderson really bludgeons you with how you should perceive a character to be talking ("...she sarcastically responded..." etc.). He evens needs to tell you when Wit is being witty smh.

I'm thinking about switching over to Mistborn, but thought I'd ask for some other recommendations. Hate WoT. Like GoT, but have resigned myself to it never being finished.

Thanks!

Looking For Recommendations Hello Fantasy reddit,

I just discovered this sub but I've been a lifelong fantasy reader and am having trouble finding new books to read in the genre. I go through maybe 3-4 books a week (on kindle, unlimited was a huge cost savings) and am having trouble finding new book series/authors to read.

I have read most of what people would recommend on here including the major series (GOT, WoT, Kingkiller, everything Sanderson, etc) and most of the other highly recommended ones as well like sufficiently advanced magic, all of will wight's stuff, powder mage, red knight, shadow campaigns, etc. I've also read a lot of web fiction and wuxia as well so am open to a wide variety of formats.

Anyways, I've read a ton of good stuff and a ton of bad stuff but I'm always looking for more to read and would love some recommendations from others who enjoy the same books I do. Hopefully you guys can give me some real gems. Thanks in advance!

Sanderson: Where should I start? Hi all, I just found this sub!

I'm looking for awesome fantasy recommendations (I love Harry Potter, the Wheel of Time, not so keen on Lord of the Rings).

I know Brandon Sanderson finished the WoT series, and people seem to rave about his own work, which I've never read yet. Where should I begin? What's the best? I prefer multi-book series, for what it's worth.

Any non-Sanderson recommendations for "must-read"s?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all!

Similarities in Harry Potter series and Wheel of Time series I read all books in Harry Potter series, including FBAWTFT &amp; QTTA, twice few years back. Now a days, I am reading Wheel of time and just finished the 3rd book. In my opinion there are few similarities in these 2 books (or maybe I say inspiration from WOT to HP or coincidence).

Below are my observations:
\- In WOT there are villain characters called as *DARKFRIENDS* same as *DEATH EATERS* in HP. Darkfriends follow the Dark Lord (the main Antagonist of WOT), same as Death Eaters follow Voldemort (the main Antagonist of HP).

\- In WOT people don't call Dark Lord by his true name, which is *Shai'tan*. Calling the Shai'tan by his name will bring misfortune to the speaker, which is why he is referred to as the Dark One or Dark Lord. Same is the case with *Voldemort*, no one speaks his name due to curse.

\- In WOT there are 3 major antagonist - *Rand, Mat* &amp; *Perrin* same as HP - *Harry, Ron* &amp; *Hermoine*.

There maybe more similarities as I am still reading 4th book out of 14 book series. In WOT 13 Darkfriends are trying to resurrect the Dark Lord (maybe they will in future books). In HP also during the resurrection of Voldemort there were Death Eaters present. I don't remember how many were there (or 13 were there).

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think of these facts. Please don't give me any Spoiler for WOT. All these facts is in my opinion and I want to share this with all of you guys. It may be inspiration or coincidence for HP books.

What should i read next Hello everyone!

I love WoT but I like to let some time pass between rereads and am currently reading book 10.
What would you recommend for reading next? I read all of Brandon Sandersons books, all of grrn and Patrick Rothfuss. I love WoT and like the Stormlight Archives a lot.

Towers of Midnight complaint (reread maybe kinda spoilers for tGS and ToM) I don't hate Sanderson for being left with the choices he was forced to make in order to get WoT the conclusion it needed. But I really noticed something this reread of Towers of Midnight. It's easily one of my favorite books in the series because of it's great pacing. But I can't stand the fact that Perrin is several weeks in the timeline behind everybody else. Tam Al'thor makes the disconnect between time so obvious as he appears in both Rand and Perrin chapters.

This is what I would have done:

I'm aware that Jordan had more material ready for the Rand and Egwene storylines before he died, and that text makes up the majority of tGS. But both Rand and Mat chapters foreshadow Perrin (which should have followed up with a few chapters in his storyline to push him further).

I know why it happened. Sanderson was given a short timeframe to have tGS ready to publish after the decision was made to split AMoL into 3 parts. I think if he had had a little more time to get Perrin lined up with the other stories, the flow of the story would have just been better going into Towers.

Yeah, that may have left tGS ending on a low note with Rand (maybe his destruction of Semirhage or destroying Natrin's Barrow) and maybe stopping Egwene right after the defeat of the Seanchan, but I think Rand's epiphany might have actually been more effective as a midpoint in ToM before leading to the big event of the book, which is Moiraine's rescue.

I'm just putting out my opinion here.

Wizard's First Rule Rant Sorry about this, but... I had to. I had to. If you care to read on you'll understand.

A couple people who pay really, really close attention to r/fantasy posts may recall that a while ago I was given a copy of Wizard's First Rule by Terry Goodkind. I was, umm, hesitant to read it, from what I'd heard, but I just proceeded to tell myself that it surely couldn't be that bad - they say it doesn't get worse until the later books anyway, right?

Holy shit. Just... holy shit. I did not realize.

I mean, it started off on a decent note. Cliched, yes, but noble country boy teams up with a badass wizard to save the kingdom is still an enjoyable premise. Expository, yes, but it was from the 90s, fantasy writing has changed a lot in the past 30 years. But by the Light, were parts of this book contrived! Kahlan happens onto where Richard, the hero, ends up walking - fair. Richard just happened to have the special book memorized in his head, *and* be the Seeker - well, I guess I can roll with that, narrative causality and all.

But. Apples are poisonous in the Midlands because the wizards just *happened* to have a "turn all food of a certain color poisonous forever and ever" spell lying around somewhere (and what does that even mean, to *have* a spell? It was taken from them, somehow...), and no it can't be reversed and also it only works once, because reasons, and also it's range limited, and also who knows there the hell the spell came from - and then Darken Rahl (or Panis Rahl, not caring right now) got his hands on it through no adequately explained method and used it because "children like red fruit".

And all of this set up just for like three moments where people got weirded out by Richard eating an apple, and as a contrived excuse for him to not have to have sex at one point.

**WHAT THE FUCK**.

Also, this is a bit of a non sequitur, but the Wheel of Time ripoffs are abundant. Now, I want to be careful about what I refer to as a "ripoff", because lots of fantasy has similarities. But this one really goes for it - there's a type of magic that women possess, and men who are born with it are considered extremely dangerous because of a time way long ago when a bunch of men got together, went crazy, and ushered in an age of Darkness. Sound familiar, WoT fans? What about the women from a foreign land who have special collars that allow them to control people in a large number of extremely specific ways, including making them feel pain, have an inability to move if they put the collar down, and being able to turn their magic against them? That's almost past ripoff and straight to fucking *stealing*. It even has, and I swear I'm not kidding, multiple times where a woman crosses her arms under her breasts. He's down to using *written tics* from the late Jordan.


Even then I was willing to call the book all right - until Darken Rahl and Demmin Nass showed up and had a conversation that went something like, and I swear this is only the slightest bit of exaggeration:

Rahl: You got the boy?
Nass: Yep, got the boy.
Rahl: You didn't molest him, did you?
Nass: Rahl, I *told* you I wasn't gonna molest this one! Just the ones you don't care about.
Rahl: Yeah, but what about that other time?
Nass: That was *ONE TIME*!

And then like three chapters later Rahl pours molten lead into a psychologically tortured pre-adolescent boy's mouth and then eats his balls. That, I should point out, is not an exaggeration at all.

I kept reading, though. And then. AND THEN. The *fucking* BDSM scene. Those of you who have read this book surely know what I'm talking about. Richard gets captured, out of nowhere, by a crazy BDSM lady with one of the aforementioned collars. I'd been warned that there was a 100-page BDSM scene in the book somewhere, but I didn't really take that warning at face value. Then this section started and it was, more or less exactly, that.

Not sure if it goes on for a hundred pages in truth, though. I made it to the part where a young girl (I got the impression she was about 9) starts BDSM torturing Richard and saying she'll have his love Kahlan raped, then he shatters her jaw and causes her to bite her own tongue off. I fucking stared at the page for a moment, processing what I'd just read. *A nine year old was fucked up enough to be talking about having a woman raped, and then Richard kicked her in the jaw hard enough that she bit her tongue off.* I then closed the book, walked to my computer, and typed this out - and I'm getting a sour taste in my mouth (literally, I can taste something sour) as I recall it.

Am I going to finish the book? I suppose so - I'm nearing the end, it'd be a shame to peace out now.

But oh dear lord. I had no idea. I... I didn't know.

Advice on collecting the Wheel of Time series. I don't know how many people here are interested in collecting the books, but I figured I would post a guide here for those interested in collecting. I'm a stickler for first editions and The Wheel of Time is definitely a series worth having on the shelf.

1) The books are sadly, inconsistent across the span. Books 1, 11, 12, 13, and 14 as well as New Spring have text that Cascades vertically down the spine, whereas the others have the title legible horizontally. This will be jarring to look at on the shelf.

2) Books 1, 2, and 3 have paperback editions that are full size and frequently be found in used bookstores, this is a great way to fill the space while seeking hardcover editions.

3) Later editions will replace the text in the bubble near the title with: The New York Times Bestseller instead of naming the previous book in the series.

4) The way to tell what edition a book is (guaranteed in the US anyway) is to look at the back of the title page. There will always be a chain of numbers printed on the page. A first edition will have a chain of the numbers 1-10 on that page usually:
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 8 6 4 2 1 3 5 7 9
1 3 5 7 9 10 8 6 4 2

5) Work from newest to oldest. First Editions of the newer books will be much easier to come across in used bookstores. And you'll be more likely to find copies in like new condition. Also look in unlikely places, I've found Knife of Dreams three times at Dollar General stores. You can get lucky with eBay lots sometimes, I got first editions of The Shadow Rising and the Fires of Heaven just from a $20 eBay lot purchase.

6) If you're planning on reading them, get 2 sets. I recommend having two sets of WoT, hardcover for collecting and paperback for reading. The Sanderson books are especially prone to warping because for some stupid reason the publisher decided to use a thicker paper, nearly doubling the size of the spine of the books, and the earlier books aren't really much more stable. (Tor has recently republished the series in large format paperback with some nice covers (yay consistency) with alternate art if you want your reader copies different, or just get the standard sized paperbacks in the box sets.

And finally, be prepared to pay top dollar for the early books. You can get lucky sometimes and come across them in stores. But to get copies of the first 3 books in 2018, in condition worth collecting, chances are you're going to have to buy them from a collector willing to part with them.

I really hope that this can help you guys in building your collections

[Spoilers All] Hot Damn, What a Ride (Quick preface, sorry if its shitty formatting, writing this at work on my phone)

Alright well, i don't usually do this kind of thing but I literally just finished the last page of aMoL and I really want to talk about it but I don't know anybody irl who has read the series, so here we are lol

First, let me start by saying that I am ashamed to admit that ive been out of highschool for 8 years now and hadnt picked up a book for a solid 7 of them.  Last year i decided to change that because i really loved reading back in school so I decided id hop on the game of thrones bandwagon like everyone else because i liked the show enough and it seems like every other person raves about it.  I read the first couple books, and theyre good dont get me wrong, but i felt like it was a waste of time to invest myself into something i might not ever get to finish so i dropped the series and went looking for something else.

After that, I was quickly pointed towards the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy.  I gobbled those books down, plus the two others that the author has released recently in the same universe, i highly recommend.  I would also recommend the trilogy specifically to anyone who might be looking for closure regarding asoiaf, not that i necessarily think asoiaf will end in the way that mst did, just that there is an uncanny amount of comparisons you could make, many being almost a one for one comparison.

Once i finished withe the MST trilogy i needed something new and remembered reading a comment on the asoiaf subreddit about WoT being a great series.  Hot damn, im glad I decided to make note of that comment in the back of my mind somewhere because this was an amazing series.  I cant deny that i was a little skeptical about a 14 book series being able to keep me hooked he entire way through, and while there was a book or two that felt like kind of a slog to get through, it was well worth it. The world, the characters, the mythos, everything about the series is well crafted and engaging, i didnt even notice too much of a difference in the writing when i got to the first of the sandersons books which was equal parts surprising and impressive, to me at least.

I cant think of anything really about the series that i dont like or thought was executed poorly.  Even the things ive seen people rag on the series for, like nynaeves incessant braid pulling, only serve to make the characters more real, more human.

I would have to say that Tam Al'Thor, Gaul, and Thom Merrilin are now some of my favorite characters.  I hated reading nynaeves chapters for the first half of the series but im glad to say by the end i started to grow more fond of her.  I do think its kind of funny, however, that i started the books really enjoying and looking forward to perrins chapters and i was dreading mats but it was pretty much reversed by the end.  I suppose the pattern must have balance yeah? Lol

Theres a couple things i find myself questioning about here at the end though.  Like, where the hell did Jain come from? Maybe i misunderstood when people talked about him and the books detailing his travels, but i assumed he was a long dead hero of old, like birgitte, not a man who had been alive and accomplishing his deeds in the last couple decades.  Also, im curious about how rands conciousness ended up in moridins body but as im typing this out im thinking it probably had something to do with callandor.

Theres only one thing i was real disappointed by to be honest, and that definitely the fact that, to me at least, it felt like the ending of padan fains whole story arc was incredibly anti climatic.  Im not really certain what i thought was going to happen with him, or what i even wanted to happen, but it felt like such a waste after having him around for all previous 13 books (whether he was specifically talked about in them or not) just for him to have practically no involvement in the last battle and then die.

Overall though i have to say its an incredible series, definitely will be recommending it to others.

Need help. I'm a very long time WoT fan maybe could say a super fan but I needed to voice something I've never looked into or googled I guess ....... But here goes. Am I the only one that truly and completely Hayes egwene to the depths of my bones? She comes off as the most self righteous know it all. And I TBH cannot stand how she's portrayed in the series she just says I know best but has never ever done any looking into history or anything like other charcaters we just have to take her at her "word" or her dreams. I dunno maybe I'm just a dumbass idiot but I finally had to ask if it was just me that really really came to be happy when her death came onto the page at the end it felt like the closing of a really bad and annoying story arc. Please be kind if I offended you cause I hate egwene more then anything for this I apologize.

Random question for the older fans and the people who found WoT in a bookstore. I just saw a post that on a different sub that suggested someone read the series. It brought back memories of how I found WoT and made me want to relive the nostalgia and share it with others. So, what book did you start with and what memories do you have of it?

I'll start.

I normally have a terrible memory but this day has always stuck with me. I was either 12 or 13 years old(which makes this 14 or 15 years ago). I went with my mom on a business trip to Sacramento after which we were going to Lake Tahoe for the weekend. While I was bored, hanging around the office where my mom had meetings, the secretary there and I got to talking. I was telling her that I was very into reading and she suggested that I go to a used bookstore that was two blocks away. When I got there it was your typical used bookstore, barely organized and full of everything a young bookworm could dream of. I remember I only had like 10 dollars so I was very picky about what book I would pick. I searched and searched and finally I came across The Shadow Rising. This copy was beat to hell. The back cover was maybe half attached at best but reading it I saw reference to a dragon and young me was ALL about dragons. So I bought it. I went back to the office my mom was at and spent the next few hours reading it. Then my mom finished her meetings and we left. I continued reading despite having figured out that there were no actual dragons in the story. That whole weekend pretty much all I did was read that book, except when my mom forced me to do things with her. The writing was so intense, like nothing I had experienced before. I loved it so much and I still do. WoT is definitely still my favorite fantasy series and probably always will be and I owe it all to that secretary, whose name I can't recall, suggesting I go to a random used book store.

So fellow redditors, I ask you to share my sudden blast of nostalgia. What's your story for how you encountered the glorious stories of Robert Jordan and what book did you start on if that applies?

Wheel of Time showrunner interview This is my favorite bookseries of all time and it is being made a series on Amazon.  I thought it having tons of women and people of color would mean it would translate to a show without being butchered. Heck the "Gandalf" of the book series is a woman who is bisexual, the most powerful rulers are a Queen and another woman on one continent on one continent and a black woman on the other. It even has black and white villains that are male and female. I was very excited it was announced until I saw this QA just now. I figured many people on this reddit have read a book in this series at one time in their lives, if not in it's entirety and I find it illuminating after all the Witcher stuff has come out with casting and statements from the showrunners.

[http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2018/09/wheel-of-time-tv-showrunner-hosts-q.html](http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2018/09/wheel-of-time-tv-showrunner-hosts-q.html)

Q**"Rigid Mars-Venus gender division etc- troubling aspects of books. Plans to update/improve these? WoT’s gr8 to discuss gender but it isn’t without problems."**
A"I’m a feminist and it’s very important to me that the show is feminist in today’s context. So a lot of those things will be changing."


Q**"Rafe, will Rand's romance plot remain close to the books? I mean, liking one girl at first but ending up with three in the end?"**

A"No."

Q **"WoT is controversial regarding how it handles gender/sexuality/mental health. My audience at WoTTalk has expressed concern on how these topics will be handled. Would you mind commenting on these concerns/how you plan to approach these topics?"**
A "I think the explorations of these topics is something important and I'll be using a lot of advisors and writers around me to make sure that we tackle them thoughtfully."



Q **On LGTBQ+ representation:**

A "I think that gender is such a key theme of the books, and discussing gender without a full representation of LGBTQ+ people would be a disservice to that discussion. Rest assured, their will be pillow friends out the wazoo."



Q Thank you so much for doing this!! Any chance you will be able to incorporate more LGBTQ characters than in the books?

A MoreYes!

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and I can't forget this tweet.

[https://twitter.com/rafejudkins/status/1034985363704438784](https://twitter.com/rafejudkins/status/1034985363704438784)

"As much as possible our cast will look like America will look in a few hundred years. A beautiful mix of white, brown, black and everything in between."

I thought this book series was SJW proof, but I guess a book series from a couple decades ago is now from the stone age and needs changed and "fixed". Game of Thrones has family f#%#ing one another but we can't have someone who is possibly god incarnate with literally multiple personalities living inside his head having affection for more than one woman and the idea that the genders are different is horrible.

They are going to push every single agenda they can to destroy things that make it great. Everything about this guy seems vapid and fake as well. I guess this is just how you have to be to work in Hollywood now. Claim to be a feminist, claim to be a huge fan and then list off all the things you will be changing and that you find problematic and change inclusiveness to a much higher ratio and change the sexual orientation, race and uniqueness of characters and try to blur genders.

Can't wait to see what Lan looks like. I know they are going to butcher that character. Way too problematic. Said things like “There is one rule, above all others, for being a man. Whatever comes, face it on your feet.”. I wonder how many other great quotes and lines will be omitted because someone finds them problematic. Lines that stuck with me for two decades since childhood.

F#@% Hollywood.

Fantasy without the magic? I’m finishing my second read of WoT now, I did enjoy LOTR of course, and Codex Alera had an interesting magic/not-magic

But I really would enjoy fantasy styles without the magic. (Sometimes it feels too cliche)

Bonus points if it’s a trilogy or less!

(No Spoilers) Is this parody cover actually from one of the books? https://i.imgur.com/EbNzVAY.png


This has to be one of my favourite parody covers. But is it actually from a WOT book? The art looks very similar to other wot books, but I can't find this one anywhere online. Any ideas?

(Spoilers) Finished - A Memory of Light Wow!  Epic fantasy at its best. It didn’t end as I thought it might. I’m left wanting to know so much more. Here’s my random thoughts and questions.

B14 - random thoughts

1. Isam = Luc = Slayer?
2. The Town:  is this near Shayol Ghul?
3. Are those who wear red viels the Aiel men who can channel who go to the waste to die?  Are they somehow transformed to the dark one?
4. MHael a Chosen and is turning Asha’men. That’s horrible!
5. I like the solution that Aviendha and others with Elaynes input have come upon for the Aiel. I like that Rand was open to changes. I hope that this allows a new future for the Aiel in stark contrast to Aviendha vision in Rhiudean.
6. Elayne as the battle leader?  I’m suspicious!  Didn’t she just endanger herself with the Black Ajah just a book ago???
7. Ogier are in the mix!  This will be interesting!!!!!
8. Rand training with Tam!  Awesome!  Why doesn’t he learn to fight with a shield or Aiel buckler on his arm?
9. Ogier war song - I wonder what that sounds like?
10. Rand singing in ebou dar.  Does he know the song the Tinkers have been searching for?
11. Is the dark one a sentient black hole singularity?
12. I dislike the drama with the horn story line. Seems contrived.
13. I’m reading the Dark Ones words in a deep base Freddy crueger voice.
14. The Last Battle chapter - read in a single sitting. Super intense. Mat is awesome. Saddened by so many characters lost. I am unable to see how the story will end in just the remaining 100 pages. It seems impossible.
15. Noal saving Olver / the new horn sounder. Touching!
16.  What exactly did Rand do in weaving together the three powers?  Does it permanently seal away the Dark One or does it somehow attach him to the pattern in a new way?
17. Confused by the ending. Alivia did what exactly for Rand?  Moridin and Rand we’re connected...but how did Rand transfer bodies?
18.  What happens next?  Rands children?  The Aiel?  Does the peace of the dragon last?  What happens with Mat and Tuon?  Does Faile become Queen of Saldea?  What about Perrin and Two Rivers then?  Elaynes children?  Thom and Moiraine?  White tower and Black tower?  Rands schools?  Rebuilding Rhuidean?  How did the discussion between Tuon and Arthur Hawkwing go?
19.  What should I read in the WoT universe next?  I heard there was a prequel book and a World book.  Are there short stories from RJ?  Are there fan theories or grand theories about the series I might have skipped to avoid spoilers?
20.  It was “an ending” but I don’t want it to be THE ending. Help!

Spoiler-Free WoT Glossary [WoT Glossary](https://habersaat.net/wot/wot.php)

Hey y'all, a while ago I started a little project on my own, it's kinda usable now and I need you guys to continue.

It's a SPOILER FREE Glossary. You can surf through characters and, important, set in which book and which chapter you currently are and ony see descriptions and events, which happened up until the location you set.  And now I wanna know, if that's something the community wishes to be worked on furthermore (I hope so).

The thing is, it's not very full yet. I also added the feature to add characters and more facts/events, BUT, this is a LOT of work, to fill this database and before I continue to work on this project. I wanted some feedback on the whole thing. Tell me whatever you think, report any kind of bug, suggest improvements, anything is welcome.

I highly encourage people to add content and fill this glossary. I'm depending on you.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I try a trusting approach. Everyone can add things, but everything not confirmed by me will show in red and one can toggle between seeing unconfirmed content.

BUT, be warned. Everyone has access now and there might happen mistakes or still exist some bugs, or by the light, some filthy shadowspawn comes by and adds incorrect content. So, **YOU MIGHT GET SPOILERS.** You should be safe in the *Confirmed Mode*, but still, I told you... At the moment it's pretty empty, only the first few characters and first few chapters are added.

Furthermore, I'm not through the books yet, (end of KoD) such that I can't check stuff after this point. I have a friend, who helps me here. But please, no spoilers in this post. :)

Thanks for your time and feedback. May the light illuminate you.

I don't like reading anything except Fantasy. Until Skyward... audio book. I have tried to read Sci-Fi. Even the second Mistborn trilogy was hard for me. I like my books to be pure fantasy. I have converted to audio books about a year ago. So I thought maybe it would be different. The story was great, light and fun! It is narrated by Sophie Aldred, who I haven't heard anything from before. She really does a great job, drawing you into the story and giving life to each character. I just came out of my first re-read of WoT, so this was a great stop before going onto something else. Still trying to decide what that something else is though.

Enjoyable fantasy novel series that isn't too difficult I have a pretty long history of reading fantasy novels, but most recently I have really been enjoying the Stormlight Archives because of how smooth everything is. I love the pacing of the series, how plainly certain parts of the story are laid out for the reader, and the simple prose. I'm not really looking for a book that I would have to be rereading passages to understand what is happening. Also trying to avoid any YA books unless you guys think they are really worth it.

In the past  5ish years I have read

WoT - enjoyed it but not my favorite

Middle Earth - loved

Mistborn (first trilogy) - loved

 The book of new sun - too literary and confusing for the type of reading I want right now, but an amazing book overall

Kingkiller Chronicles - did not enjoy. Not sure why

Song of Fire and Ice - loved

I really want to start reading Malazan, but it seems that it will be more similar to Gene wolfe writing than Sanderson. Worried it might be a little much for my brain at the moment. Any recommendations based on that? I appreciate any help you guys have for me!

How do the non-Cosmere books compare? I’m fully read up on the Cosmere books, and I loved them all, but I haven’t read any of Brandon’s non-Cosmere books (except WoT).  How do they stack up?  Which ones are the best for an avid Cosmere fan to get my fix?

[No Spoilers] Reading KoD is sad I started reading WoT a little more than a year ago, because i like Sanderson and wanted to get to his book. At the beginning i was finding the books slow and a bit of a chore (some of them kind of were tbh) but i slowly started loving the series and RJ.
Now that im reading the last book written by him i feel a weird sense of sadness, despite reaching my "initial goal" of getting to the sanderson books.
This is to Robert Jordan or James Oliver Rigney Jr. a great author who created the world we all love so much. He died prematurely but left an epic and a great legacy behind. Thank you

What an incredible series! I have just finished reading the series over the span of about 7 weeks. I started reading TEOFTW early in September 2018 and just completed ANS the novel last week.

Reading this series has always been on my bucket list since university. However, here in the small islands of Fiji,no bookshop sold the entire collection. Only book 8 occasionally or book 11. Having downloaded kindle really changed that.

I throughly enjoyed the story. Binge reading the narrative often at night when the family is asleep has been very fulfilling. The audiobooks read by Kramer and Reading were wonderful!

I am currently reading now the Stormlight Archive by B. Sanderson.

I plan to re read the WOT yearly in September. In my opinion, it really is that good. I really enjoyed Martim’ character roundly reading his development. Goldeneyes (Spoilers!) fight in the two rivers was equally enjoyable as was rand (again Spoilers)  small contact with the True Power and banishment of Cadsuane.( while I get her role with Rand, I did not like her bullying tactics imo.

Overall A wonderful way to spend a few weeks. Can’t complain imagining rand land and all that goes with it.

Something that bothered me (no book spoilers) Most of the time on Reddit I see lots of support for WoT in various subs even in the fantasy sub but it all stops short in the r/books sub. They seem to have a serious special hate for WoT that borders on loathing. It even seems to spill over onto Sanderson which I really do not understand because I've showed his books to many people, even people that don't like fantasy, and everyone has loved his books. Just look at the recent post in that sub about George R. R. Martin if you want to know what I mean.

But this got me thinking and I realized that the way people were talking about WoT it seemed like none of them had even read any of it. Just really vague statements that they could apply to almost any fantasy series. What really irked me though was that people were making these broad statements about Jordans writing and then equating it to Sandersons work. And since it's a general sub people who haven't read his books would see all this and besides get caught up in the WoT hate bandwagon they'd throw Sanderson under the bus with it. It's just really sad to see a subreddit, especially a book one, ruin experiences for potential new readers for a hard working writer.

[IIL] The Wheel of Time books and the Farseer trilogy [WEWIL] I've been re-reading the WoT cycle and I'm nearing the end. I feel bummed out since I love it and I've just devoured it so fast, so I'm looking for a new epic in this style, or something akin to the Farseer universe as well. Length would be a plus, since I'm a heavy reader and I can't seem to get enough, and it does not need to be epic fantasy, although the genre is more my speed than more tame heroic fantasy.

What to read I consider myself a fantasy fan, but have only really ever read the huge classics such as LotR, ASoIaF, Discworld, A Wizard of Earthsea, etc, and I'm just started reading WoT. I've also read and enjoyed a few lesser-known series such as the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix. What fantasy series would you recommend to allow to delve more deeply into the genre?

But I also just finished listening to Stormlight (I had read it but not listened to it) and found being brought through the story in audio form was incredible.

Strongest high fantasy characters (books only) I'm not a native english speaker so please correct me if i do some hard mistakes.


Over the last few years i had read about 100 to 200 fantasy books. From WoT to Warhammer to Malazan to Demon Cycle and many many more xD. So I hope I know some (definitely not all) of the most OP characters out there.


So maybe we can make a list of "The Most Epic OP Badassess" of high Fantasy Books.

I propose we will split them into two categories Wizards and "Sword guys" from 1 “the most OP one” to 10 “the weakest” of this list. I already made a two of them. Please make your mind about it and comment your opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Magus / Wizards / Magician**

1. Lord Kroak (Warhammer)
2. Rand (WoT)
3. Bug or Icarium (Malazan)
4. Sauron or Tom Bombadil (Lord of the Rings)
5. Villentretenmerth (Witcher)
6. Kip Guile (lightbringer)
7. Jasnah Kholin (The Way of the Kings)
8. Eragon (Eragon Saga)
9. The Old Man (Vault of Heaven)
10. Sonea (Sonea Sage)




**One vs one with a Weapon (Sword, Axe, Speer, Bow, etc.)**

1. Anomander Rake (Malazan)
2. Aenarion the Defender      (Warhammer)
3. Rand al’thor or al’Lan Mandragoran (WoT)
4. Havald (Askier)
5. Gerald of Riva (The Witcher Series)
6. Kylar Stern (The Night Angle Saga)
7. Hadrian Blackwater (Riyria Revelations)

Starting The Gathering Storm (book 12). Intro is tearful. [no spoilers] So I’m going through the audiobooks and am starting the first book from Brandon Sanderson and the opening made me tear up. His recount of his experience growing up with WoT, the news of RJ’s passing, and how he plans to stay true to everything RJ intended and to us is so meaningful. I am excited to see how he writes and his depictions on everything, but am sad of RJ’s passing and how he couldn’t properly finish his epic. I hope he (and all of us as well) do RJ proud! Rest In Peace.
Now to start the final “trilogy”. Here we go!

Good, non-spoilering fan-art/merch? Hey guys,

I think this is my first post here on this sub. I've been reading WoT since spring and just started Book 5 recently (I'm not a fast reader).

I really like it.
And I really enjoy thinking about the world and what is going to happen, I like the fact that it it such a detailed &amp; complex world.

What I kind of miss is more graphics and stuff like that. Especially because I read on an e-reader, I don't get to see any good looking graphics, maps etc. - but I've seen and heard that the art and maps in the books aren't that good, either.

Now I would love to put a poster or something like that up in my apartment. Something like a detailed map, or some really good fan-art. I don't want any spoilers, though, so I don't even want to look up stuff too much. I also don't want any art depicting characters, since I want to keep my mental image of them.
What I'm thinking is for example [these US state "sigils"](https://imgur.com/gallery/5gaMk) apparently designed after game of throne houses (never read/watched that).

Something kind of abstract but really well done would be cool. Has anybody seen anything like that for WoT?

Help with tattoo ideas? (Small spoilers, I guess) Hey everyone, I finished the series for the first time a few months ago. I've wanted a tattoo for a while (never gotten one), and WoT is the first thing that has really inspired me to actually get one. I was thinking about doing the standard kind of wheel of time on that I've seen a few times on here, but since it's my first tattoo, I want something that feels more unique to my experience of the story.

One of my favorite sayings in the whole series is "Water and shade." I can't really explain why, but it spoke to me and made me really fall in love with the Aiel. I was thinking of getting a tattoo that somehow depicts water and shade while still being gritty and minimal, since that's how the Aiel are. I'm not creative or artistic in the least, and my brain hasn't come up with any sort of idea for what I could go with, so I'm asking for input.

Is anybody better at this than I am? Any help would be appreciated.

(No Spoilers)Magic Portrayal in the WoT TV Show We all hope that the TV show will go the extra mile to make the magic feel real and accurate according to how we felt and imagined reading the books. The best portrayal that I've felt(or overall excellence) is in the movie King Arthur. I felt they did such a good job with making the magic visual and really enjoyed the scene where Arthur destroys a whole group of soldiers. Also the design of the evil uncle's "suit" reminded me of Ba'alzamon and could imagine him quite accurately like that.

What are some of the styles of magic that you've seen on screen that you'd like to see in the TV Show?

(Spoilers All) Missed opportunity with The Song &gt; I will find the song, or another will find the song, but the song will be sung in this year or in another year. As it once was, so shall it be again, world without end.

- Tuatha'an Farewell

I was saddened to read the end of the WoT and not get the opportunity to rejoice with the Tuatha'an when they found The Song. I was sure it would tie into the Last Battle somehow, as part of their greeting was "As it was, so shall it be, if we but remember, seek, and find." hinting that only once they find the Song then the times of prosperity will return which could have been a perfect transition at the end of the series.

Also, remember the shared joy you felt when you heard the hope being renewed among the Malkieri people when Nynaeve told them the Golden Crane flew for Tarmon Gaidon? I sure did, gives me goosebumps each time. This could have been another one of those moments. The Song being found would be a welcome revision to the TV Show and would give more purpose to the Tuatha'an.

Granted, in book form this wouldn't have been as amazing, to read the song, but in the show they'd have the opportunity to make it impressive and quite an enjoyable moment.

Trouble going through the books I’m not a die hard reader. In fact, the last books I read are Harry Potter way back when the first books came out. A time ago, a friend of mine told me to try the WOT books, so I did. I can say that I really love the books so far. Now I’m at a point ( halfway Lord Of Chaos ) that I don’t open the book anymore. I don’t know why, but the love of reading is gone atm. Should I just continue reading in the hope that it all comes back? Or should I try a new book? If so, are there any suggestions?

Wheel Of Time or The Dark Tower Got some spare time on my hands, I've got The Gunslinger and was ready to start reading it but just heard about WOT.

Could somone please give me a side by side of those two series based on:

-World Building

-Writing Quality

-Real World Refrences

-(Less important) Magical/Fantasy Focus

-Age Recommended

I'm 20 years old, Really like fantasy, adventure, huge fiction worlds (therefore interested in world building), history, and romance. I tend to read less and am more invested in Mangas, But would really want to read a big series now that I have the time.
For comparison, I really liked the Harry Potter books, And didn't really get through A Song Of Ice And Fire.
What I liked about TDT is the huge multiverse of Stephen King, Though I have to admit that a single 14-volume series may be even better.
I realize that such a review/comparison is a huge thing to ask, But I would truly appriciate it as i'm eager to get into one of those series, And this is the only place I can turn to with questions about it.

Sorry about mispelling/formatting, Wrote from phone.

I skipped three books... So when I was reading WOT I ended up dropping the series at Lord of Chaos and was distracted by university and didn't think about it for several years. A few years ago I was working at a remote mining camp (I'm a geologist) and noticed Winter's heart on a shelf and thought (that was the next book right?) and picked up again from there.

Too be honest my memory of what was going on in the last book I had read was so fuzzy that I didn't realize I skipped three books until I managed to get back to a bookstore months later! I just kept going and finished the series.

Wheel of Time: when can I switch series? I just finished book 3 of the WoT series.  Fricken amazing books.  But I was hoping for a new story with new characters for a bit.  I was wondering everyone's opinions on the best time to stop?  I felt pretty satisfied with the ending of book 3, like something was accomplished and resolved.  Obviously theres lots more coming, but felt this was okay to stop here.  I have never read LotR so was really hoping to start that now (no better movies out there IMO, so I feel like I have to read the books).

Is book 3 an okay place to stop reading WoT?

I like ASOIAF as much as the next person, but couldn’t get into “The blade itself”.

The ending of WoT series I think I'm going to be in the minority on this, but I didn't really like the last three books of the Wheel of Time series that Sanderson wrote.

Is there anyone else out there that felt kind of let down at the end of the series?

I started reading them when book eight came out, and I loved the series. My dad and I would reread from the beginning every time a new book was set to be released, so I was really hopeful when they announced someone would complete the story.

I'm not looking to have a bash session on the Sanderson books, but I've seen a lot of posts where people really enjoyed how he handled them. Just wondered if there was anyone else that felt the same, or if I just missed something and should give them another shot.

Signed Books I'm sure there's a simple answer to this, but I'm probably missing the obviois. My fiancée and I have been fans since Brandon finished up WoT, and we had several signed books.

Unfortunately, our house was destroyed in Hurricane Michael back in October. Luckily, all of my Robert Jordan signed books (which I've collected since high school) were at my parents' house, but all my Brandon-signed books were in our bedroom, which had a tree fall on it. I thought we'd saved Oathbringer, but it turned out to be our non-signed copy (though I'm glad we still have it; it was a release-day buy). We lost (between signed and non-signed) WoK, WoR, Arcanum Unbounded, Oathbringer, Warbreaker, Elantris, and tFE (the rest are audio books or e-books, so safe!).

Is there anywhere we can go to replace what we've lost? I don't know if our insurance policy covers something like this (screw State Farm renters'), but I'd hate to permanently lost such a big part of my fiancée's and my history.

If you could pick one Series (lesser famous works) to be made into a TV Series, What would it be? So a question came up today about a Robin Hobb tv show which got mw thinking:

**What book would I want to see as a TV series?**

And to avoid just the main few we all know people will choose (First Law, Malazan, Lightbringer, WoT, Dresden Files etc) let's focus on **less popular works.**

For me, i think i would love to see a Magic School type show where we follow a group of underdogs who need to approach magic differently than everyone else (John Bierce's Into the Labyrinth or Andrew Rowe's Sufficently Advanced Magic, or even Taran Matharu's Summoner, Tamora Pierce's well, anything). For more of an adult, classical experience, i think I'd love to watch an epic fantasy like The Spellmonger Series by Terry Mancour.

So what about you guys? What smaller, lesser known series would you like to see on TV?

Spoilers (Whole Series) Why I Think The Show Should Include All 13 Forsaken This has come up a couple times in show-related threads so I thought I'd make it its own topic.

I think the show MUST include all 13 Forsaken.  Now, I am biased: the Forsaken are my favorite thing about the series, and I love that there's 13 of them.  It was just such a cool gimmick when I started reading the books (20+ years ago) and to me it's a core part of the appeal of the series.

I'll also state that I do *not* think the show needs to include the resurrections/body changes.  This thread isn't about that, but I'd cut Aran'gar/Osan/gar, have Moridin just look like Ba'alzamon without the CGI effects, and have Lanfear and Graendal stay themselves.  Instead, I'm writing about why I'd keep all 13 original Forsaken in the story.

**The Big Four -- Plot-Crucial Regulars**

Ishamael, Lanfear, Moghedien, and Asmodean are clearly long-term characters who will probably be regulars for at least one season each and appear in multiple seasons (ok, two for Asmodean).  They have major, irreplaceable plot functions and are crucial characters to the enjoyment of the series.  They're also going to be extremely interesting to see cast -- Ishamael is a great villainous part, Lanfear is going to be a chance for Amazon to cast an extremely attractive person\*, and Moghedien and Asmodean are challenging roles for character actors.

**The Little Three -- Guest Appearances Only**

Aginor, Balthamel, and Be'lal all die in, essentially, their first appearance.  There's nothing to be gained from cutting these characters, so they should stick around.  And you don't really need to cast names or, like, Olivier nominees for them, either.

**Mesaana -- Guest Appearance or Background Actress?**

Mesaana can be essentially just a figure in shadow who communicates with Alviarin through a distorted voice (in, like, 2 scenes) until her showdown with Egwene.  This is, like the "little three", a nothing role -- all that matters is that the audience knows there's a Forsaken in the Tower.

That said, if it were me, I'd cast some unknown, but respected, theater actress as Dannelle Sedai and have her as a background performer/extra from our first trip to the Tower on, briefly being introduced to Egwene, sitting in meetings with Elaida taking notes and having only like two lines per season.  But that's me.

**Rahvin and Sammael -- Arc Villains**

I've seen suggestions that these guys be merged, but I don't see how that's workable, because they serve as arc villains that give structure to Rand's plot.  Rahvin is Rand's principal foe for the events of Fires of Heaven.  Sammael is crucial to the events of Crown of Swords.  Unless you're planning to combine the Caemlyn and Ilian plots, merging these guys doesn't save time in the plot and actually makes things more confusing.

I'll also note that they're distinct in other, important ways.  There seems to be a consensus that Elayne's Game-of-Houses plot should be done away with in any adaptation and I would also cut the whole Morgase plotline, but whatever you do with those things, Rahvin's actions in Caemlyn are fundamentally important to to Trakand characters.   Sammael, on the other hand, is involved with the Shaido, with Jaichim Carridin, and with Graendal.  Plus Sammael is a source of unintentional humor -- because he is a buffoon and a louse -- whereas Rahvin has an extremely creepy, sex offender vibe.  I'd prefer keeping those separate.

Also, without Sammael and Rahvin being independent characters, Rand's actions in Fires of Heaven are a lot less clever.

Each of them is also an interesting role to cast.  For Rahvin, you want someone darker-skinned than most WOT characters, and extremely handsome\* -- smooth-seeming at first, but able to turn of oily and unpleasant -- whereas Sammael is a character actor part with a lot of meat to it.  Because they're each mostly featured in a single arc, you could likely get pretty decent actors for the roles.

**Demandred -- Regular, or Arc Villain?**

Demandred is obviously awesome and not to be cut.  The fork with him is whether, in the show, he's Mazrim Taim.  If yes, then he's in the first category with Ishamael and Lanfear, because clearly Taim will be in a lot of the show (dude delivers arguably the most famous line in the series).  If no, then he's almost completely MIA until the endgame, when he assumes an "arc villain" role like Rahvin and Sammael before him.

The issue of his identity plays into another issue:  the Forsaken "chats."  In general, I think the show should reduce the Forsaken chat sequences.  They require the actors be cast for roles that won't be important for years in advance, they're mostly info dumps, and they remove all tension associated with wondering where the Forsaken may be hiding, because you see their faces -- basically, you never want Mesaana, Semirhage, or Demandred to be at the chats (so the one in Tel'aran'rhiod that Birgitte and Nynaeve spy on would be ok).

I'm ok with Demandred showing up for the final season only, or with a few guest appearances before that if he's not Taim -- but those can only happen if we're abandoning the is-he-or-isn't-he-Taim thing altogether.

**Semirhage -- Recurring Character**

Semirhage spends a lot of time offscreen, and, like in the books, will probably be mentioned much more often than she's seen.  But unless one intends to cut the Seanchan, she's important to the plot, both as the hand behind Suroth and because, as Anath, she's one of the few characters in Tuon's orbit who connects to non-Seanchan plots.  In other words, once Tuon is introduced, she's going to have to have a couple other Seanchan to talk to, and one of them might as well be the person who's going to attack Rand one season later.

(While it may not be relevant to everyone, she is also one of the only prominent characters who is canonically black, and it is unlikely that the show will cut such a character.  I do think that the "Semirhage in captivity" plotline, assuming the show makes it that far, should be about one episode.)

This adds up to someone who's in a couple episodes in a couple, later seasons.  It's not going to be hard for the show to fill that role.

**The Tough One -- Graendal**

That leaves Graendal.  Graendal admittedly seems like she could be cut or at least as though most of her role could be divvied up among Lanfear, Moghedien, and Semirhage.  IIRC, she never interacts directly with the main cast -- Rand balefires her from a distance, sight unseen; Nynaeve, Birgitte, and later Perrin see her in the world of dreams, but never converse with her, she fights Verin's circle at the Cleansing, and Aviendha fights her at the end, but they have no connection, making that fight (IMHO) one of the less enjoyable ones of the climax.  Her real purpose for most of the series is to shine a light on the scheming ways of the Forsaken as a group -- harder to do if Forsaken chats are trimmed back -- and to conveniently explain why large parts of the continent are in chaos.

She is an interesting character -- a brilliant schemer who is semi-successfully pretending to be shallow -- but if we mainly see her interact with Sammael and Sevanna, both of whom are stupid, I'm not sure that would come across, even if we see Asmodean telling Rand how dangerous she is.  It's a challenge for the writers -- and the actress -- play those scenes so it's clear that her mind is working a million miles an hour.  Maybe she could be given a couple scenes with Lanfear or Moghedien where she drops the mask altogether.

She could take on a few roles vacated by other characters.  If Aran'gar is omitted, she could be Sheriam's Forsaken contact and the person who rescues Moghedien (with inverted weaves or a ter'angreal or something).  If Taim is Demandred, she could be responsible for turning a bunch of Sharans to the Shadow.  It could be made explicit that she's the one manipulating Masema (it's not clear who's behind the in the books, but she's a reasonable guess, as in Lanfear), or that she's responsible for the latest round of messing with Jain Farstrider's head.  She could be given a more compelling role in the fight at the Cleansing.

Finally, I posted elsewhere about characters you'd leave in for entertainment value, even if they're not plot-crucial.  Graendal makes that cut for me.  She is an extremely beautiful woman\* who presents outwardly as extremely feminine and obsessed with self-indulgence, while actually being one of the smartest and most effective Forsaken and deadly in personal combat.   She almost wrecks the forces of the Light in the Last Battle with Compulsion.  To me, it enriches the WOT world to have her zipping around from book 5 on, authoring huge amounts of chaos and misery while never quite being on the good guys' radar until Rand decides he's had it.


I like her and I'd keep her around.

&amp;#x200B;

\*I assume the show, being on Amazon, will follow the Game of Thrones/prestige TV blueprint of "most people are pretty good-looking, and a few are REALLY good-looking" not the CW/basic cable blueprint of "as many cartoonishly hot people as possible".  Certain Forsaken fall into the "REALLY good-looking/cartoonishly hot" category.

What would you change about the WoT plot/character details if you could? With a TV show potentially coming up, it seems like the perfect opportunity to put ourselves in the mind of the Creator and think about what you would do differently, if you could go back in time and talk to RJ before he starting writing the series.

Personally, I would redo the whole Forsaken aspect of the series, aside from the main villains repeatedly proving themselves ludicrously incompetent, there is some unnecessary inconsistency/redundancy when it comes to that entire aspect.

1. I would start with the Eye of the World having a definite and important function - acting as the "eighth" seal on the Dark One, specifically the part of his prison where the Forsaken are contained. The first novel would then end in a shocking plot twist - everything Rand was doing in his attempts to save the EotW was a manipulation, sent by a semi-awakened Ishamael through his dream powers, to free the Forsaken from their prisons. (But that's okay, because the last battle has to happen, and delaying/preventing it indefinitely would not be the better option). In this way, the Eye served a dual purpose - awakening Rand's channeling/dragon status (plus important artifacts), as well as awakening the leaders of the Dark Side. Also, Rand's angst about being the chosen one would have more substance, considering that the first thing he did in this capacity was freeing the Dark One's lieutenants.
2. All thirteen Forsaken are freed simultaneously at the end of the first novel (though the main characters do not necessarily fully understand this until later).  All of them are decrepit from thousands of years of imprisonment, not just Alphinor and Betamel, and have to possess new bodies. These new bodies aren't just random people selected for being hot, but rather high-ranking members of the Third Age society (e.g. when Mesaanaa infiltrates the White Tower as Danelle, her soul is actually wearing the real Danelle's body).
3. The Forsaken start out by having a coordinated plan - each of them is assigned/allowed to select a major faction/part of the world, infiltrate it (by transmigrating their soul from their old body into the body of an appropriate host), make it serve the Dark One and/or weaken it before the last battle. Of course, the DO fully expects them to also take the occasional moment to try and backstab each other, which still serves his purposes because it sows chaos and confusion among the factions in their control.
4. More victories for the Forsaken. E.g. the White Tower rebellion story arc should really have ended with Egwene's faction taking the physical White Tower, but only after Mesaana turns most of the loyalist Aes Sedai to the dark side and runs away with them and all of their artifacts. Aginor/Osangar should have been the same person as Mazrim Taim (having taken over the body of the false Dragon after his capture) and in charge of the Black Tower, etc.
5. Cut Shaidar Haran completely. In the earlier books he is completely useless - the Dark One already has a fully-loyal representative who exclusively uses the Dark Side of the Force - Ishamael/Moridin/the Nibbler. In the latter books he turns into an egregious case of Diabolus Ex Machina, where he zips around doing things like freeing Semirage with a snap of his fingers, just to keep the drama going. Seriously, the woman has a reputation of Hannibal Lecter, where she can simply talk her guards into freeing her and/or killing themselves, let her use it on-screen to free herself. Ffs BS, ever heard of the Chekhov's gun?
6. Around the climax of the penultimate book, have the main character(s) gather a coalition of armies ready to venture into the Blight to exterminate the Trollock horde before they endanger civilians in Randland. Then deliver a shocking plot twist - the scattered Trollock tribes that have been skirmishing with Borderlanders over the centuries is pretty much all the Blight really holds and it is largely empty inside. Then, as they're all very confused and stranded in no man's land, Randland kingdoms are simultaneously attacked by the 4chan from one side, Sharans from another side, the Aiel go apeshit, Black Ajah and Shamans start breaking large areas of the world, and chaos reigns. Plot twist: the Last Battle was never about humanity vs endless hordes of mindless monsters, but rather humanity destroying itself due to the Forsaken's manipulations.
7. Significantly tone down teleportation magic. Seriously, it kills all tension and atmosphere when any character can instantly be in any other part of the world. Also, it makes it completely implausible that the Forsaken haven't solved all of their problems a long time ago. E.g. it's ridiculous for them to fail at killing Peregrin and Merry. Moridin (somehow) had a way of tracking their location... which means all they needed to do was open a portal to their location, instantly nuke that area with as much power as possible, and then keep nuking it. Even if one of them somehow survives that and escapes due to their main character powers, just rinse and repeat as needed. Those two guys won't be able to keep up their game for very long if any place they go to gets blown up. To say nothing of the hordes of Murdraals who can teleport between any two shadows, Grey Men who can slip anywhere unnoticed, and Drakkar who can fly, all of whom just sit around and do nothing for the most part.

Anyway, these are just my thoughts, feel free to share yours (something apart from fixing the pacing, because I think everyone can agree that RJ's last five books could have easily been condensed into three, and BS's three should have been two or just one).

P.S. Participation award to the obligatory "I for one would not presume to alter a SINGLE THING about the original books, and it is SACRILEGE to imply that they are anything less than perfect! Shame, shame, shame." comment. You know it's coming, and with two hundred upvotes at that.

[Spoliers] Found this series about WoT on youtube https://youtu.be/9KcvyVy24Eo

I've seen some of CivilzationExs other videos and thought they were interesting but they were never on something I knew the lore on fairly well. Now I'm wondering how accurate they are. While I don't know all the deep lore of WoT I thought I caught a couple of thing wrong in the linked video. They say Hawkwing refused medicine when he fell sick, but didn't he only refuse healing from Aes Sedai. Also they say that this turning of the Wheel of Time is when he was bound to the horn, but I thought the books said he had been bound for many turnings of the Wheel.

So my question is did CivilizationEx seriously get information that is in the main series wrong while having quite a bit of information from outside the main series, or am misremebering/misunderstanding things? Their videos are interesting so it might be fun to watch more but it would be silly to do so if they are full of misinformation.

Finished Path of Daggers... Finally, and I wanted to make sure I know everything before I read Winters Heart. Ok, so I started the WoT in eighth grade, and I'm finally on book nine in my sophomore year. I have put the book down a few times mostly at Path of Daggers, that was the toughest thing i've read story line wise. And as the title states i would like a quick refresh, also I remember this author was reading WoT and he would post a quick recap and his opinions for every book on his website. Anyone know the website?

Liking WH (spoilers for #9) I'm a very longtime WoT fan. Plowed through the waits since TRS, but only today I discovered this subreddit, and decided to share a thought.

I really liked Winter's Heart.
I see that people usually lump it together with 8 and 10 as the weakest part of the series, but I blame mostly 8 and 10. Mostly 10.

I always thought that 9 was a good read that helped me stick around after the letdown of 8.

Not only because of the cleansing. The whole Far Madding story was different and interesting. Elaine's plotting didn't get tiresome yet, and the sister bond with Aviendha was also unique.
Though I admit it's been a few years since I read it last, so I don't remember more interesting points.

What do you think? Does anyone agree?

I’m in the early books of WoT and I’m really hating Matt. Matt’s the biggest asshole. Like I’m sorry I hope he gets better or maybe that’s just his character. But I’m on book two and he’s being a dick to Rand. Like I get it your afraid of him wielding the one power but dude get over it. Sorry if this is a unpopular opinion he’s just not my favorite right now.

15 years later, and I still remember this scene. (Spoilers TGH) So i'm a longtime lurker on this sub. Thought it might be nice to share my favorite moment from the books. That's all this is so I hope that may save a few people some time who aren't interested. Which I get, no hard feelings.

Flashback to about 15 years ago, i was a very young, very angry teenager. I was jaded, filled up with that most heinous cocktail of rage and depression. Lots of fights, lots of drugs, lots of fuck this, fuck you, fuck this place. All that nonsense that makes my heart break whenever I hear it coming from a young person today. My sweet Grandmama, who worked at a university, had seen WOT on a display at the University bookstore and bought me a copy. I never slept much and my family didn't have cable so I used to spend most rainy nights reading anything to make the time pass. So EOTW caught my attention enough that I wanted the next one and she, being a saint who never gave up on me, found it for me. By this time I was pretty close to doing that one thing, that one thing that lots of us think about from time to time, the thing you don't walk away from. It hurts now even to remember it. How close I came, how much I would have missed. So anyways I'm reading TGH. and I get to that scene with Ingtar and Rand when they are trying to escape Falme. The Seanchan are looking for them and it's looking like they aren't gonna make it out. Then Ingtar confides in Rand and reveals what he is, what he had done. The line I never forget is "No man can walk so long in the Shadow that he cannot come again to the Light." And he pulls his piece and goes to work, buying time for Rand and company to escape. I remember the book falling out of my hands. And crying for the first time in what had been years. Here was a man so far gone, so scared that he had sold out his Homeland, who still found redemption. I suppose it showed me that no matter how far gone you are, it's never too late to find something worth fighting for. Now I didn't change right away, no magical overnight transformation, but Ingtar's sacrifice gave me that one thing I didn't know I so desperately needed, what I was blindly grasping for in all that darkness, hope. Which as I grow older, I have found to be the greatest thing one can give. "No man can walk so long in the Shadow that he cannot come again to the Light." I still believe that, I must believe that. For anyone still reading, from the bottom of my heart I thank you.

Been meaning to read the WoT series for over a decade, started last Oct and finally finished Wow, finally finished the WoT series after almost 14 months completely blown away by it.
The depth and character arcs are stupendous, still undecided on who my favorite character is,
Mat is everything I wanted to be at his age yet Lan has such Integrity and Honor.

About to start New Spring and then the companion books, this series will need a re-read sometime in 2019 albeit via Audible

Loved it amazing and will be recommending it to anyone who cares to listen

 "Egwene started slowly across the carpets between 2 rows. with sheriam following close behind and Clamesha stood."

part 24 starts with

 " Strangely the same folk who have said with bare politeness ( dont know for sure. bad quality sound on this part) that they had no use for bedgemmed necklaces went round eyes at the unset stones rolling about in Aviendas palm."

Just wanted to come praise this Sub I recently started WoT and I've been really enjoying it, so obviously I went to check out their sub to chat about the series and, well, they've disappointed me.

The best you'd find on that sub for a spoiler warning is a "(spoilers)" in the title. I'm now on book 5 and things are really picking up, and it would be fun to chat on their sub about what I've read so far, but from the few posts I've opened I can't trust browsing that sub at all.

So I decided that maybe I should make a post and bring up my issue, and I was glad to see one of the top posts was someone else doing just that, and when I opened it...

"The series just has so many books, it's too hard to remember when things happened"

Saw a few comments that said some version of that and most people seemed to agree.

So I decided to come back to my  favourite subreddit. a place where people can discuss and epic world composed of like, 19 odd books, and do so with the due diligence required to ensure that they're not ruining the series for anybody else.

Best place to take a break WoT I’m currently reading the Wheel of Time for the first time and have just finished The Great Hunt. I am loving the series so far and definitely want to read more!

Thinking about delving into a smaller, less acclaimed series in between the biggies I’ve been reading, and I’m looking for suggestions among three different series. So I’m a pretty big Malazan fan (7 books in and planning on a reread once I’m finished), and I like WoT (4 books in) and ASOIAF. I love these series and plan to keep reading them, but I like to switch it up and throw other, smaller series in the mix to avoid malazan/wot fatigue. This means it takes me an eternity to finish any series but I’m okay with it. Right now I’m looking at 3 series: The Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne, The Dagger and the Coin, and The Traitor’s Son Cycle. Thoughts on these series? Recommendations?

And just to help with recommendations, I generally like any epic fantasy with a big universe full of lore. I get pumped when I see a lengthy glossary in the back of a book. I also like grey morality and a general subversion of the classic tropes. Gritty military fantasy is a plus. Thanks for taking the time to help!

Does it get better after the first book [The Wheel of Time]? I read all more or less popular fantasy series, leaving WoT for a dessert due to mixed reviews. Still i decided to read it because i want to know what can it offer that other epic series like ASoIaF or Stormlight can't.

And, well, i stuck onto the first book, around post-village attack events.

I really want to dig into this series, so i need to ask those who had the same problems as me, but pushed through them.

Will author's style get better and characters become less cliched boring?

Will the pacing get better? Will there be some cool concepts of magic or interesting use of literature tropes?

I mean, i easily went through Gardens of Moon, and some people consider it to be the worst starting experience for the long series, and long descriptions of events in Rand's village and how everyone are worshipping Moiraine couldnt pick up my interest like at all. Neither do three main characters.

So, does it get better later so i just need to push through?

WoT is driving me nuts and I am only on book four! I am so, so, so, so, so sick of the endless man/women/catfight/man/women/man&amp;women/Men&amp;woman/mustbe men &amp; women/men and women is everything \*\*\*\*ing nonsense in these books!!! I have never ever seen such a projection of a particular obsession of a concept in any other series.

Does it get any better? I am most of the way through book four and I don't think I can take any more. Why can't he be interested in ANYTHING but constant man/woman stuff? A relationship between a man and a woman is important but outside of something written on family values by The Pope, I don't think I have ever had to suffer such a repeated concept being shoved down my throat. Even porn addicts aren't as fixated!

If he was alive I would love to slap him. This is the most frustrating read I have ever had. I have never had such a strong reaction to a series of books. I think I am actually going to have to give up on these and this is the first time this has ever happened.

What should I read next? I picked up The Eye of the World last December, and ended up spending the next 10 months reading through the entire Wheel of Time. I loved it all, even the slower books. This was the first fantasy series that I'd read, so when I finished A Memory of Light I figured that picking up a new fantasy series would be the way to go. I did some googling and found lists of the best fantasy series and decided to try the Malazan Book of the Fallen next.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward two months and I've only made it through \~50 pages of book 1. I just can't seem to get into this one the way I got into WOT from the beginning. I can't exactly put my finger on the difference, but it's just not making me want to sit down and keep reading. So rather than looking at lists of the best fantasy series, I'm looking for input from other WOT fans on the best thing to read next. I'm open to anything, but I'd prefer another long series.

Finished oral re-read of The Shadow Rising! Onward to The Fires of Heaven. I have been re-reading the WoT series one chapter per day to my wife now for about a year now.  She was finishing chemo last December (thank the Light that is over!) and is doing very well now.  We are starting The Fires of Heaven today.  The Prologue looks too long for one sitting -- I have set a limit of 20 pages per day.   It seems that the chapters are getting longer with each book!  This book will take to the end of January or even February to read.

I do find it nice to kind of know what is next. My first time through I was lost much of the time. I seem to remember somethings came later or lasted longer than they actually did. We will often stop and talk about something that just happened in the story. It is hard, however, to resist spoilers, especially since she seems to pick up on foreshadowing and other clues better than I did.

Alanna Innocent??? Browsing this subredit and also the other WoT related ones, it seems to me, Alanna gets loads of crap, for rapebonding Rand. I have never understood this, because reading it (well as soon as i got to the chapter, where verrin "persuades" Aes Sedai to swear fielty to Rand) I didn't have any doubts to Verrin being the corporate, using her makeshift compulsion on the poor green.
Supporting my theory:
\-Basically I love Verrin and she is more than capable, to do such a thing.
\-People knowing Alanna would never have thought, she'd do something like that.
\-Alanna herself, was shocked by how sudden her realisation came, that she had to bond Rand.
Against it:
She couldn't really explain the decision, where as typically under Verrin's compulsion the victim would make huge efforts in rationalising the forced decisions.


One could argue either way and there is also the possibility, that i missread something, but for me it is head canon, that Verrin is the one responsible for rands exploitation.
Is there any actual canon, that I've missed and if not: what are you guys thoughts on the matter?

Never made it past the second book, giving the series a fresh try. Any advice?

I enjoyed the first book, though it was dry. The second just lost my interest altogether by the middle of the book (I think some long meandering passage with Kruppe?), but a recent void in my reading life has inspired me to give Malazan a good ol' college try.

For reference, I've read WoT and most other major fantasy works, and have no problem keeping track of characters - it's mainly the dryness that bothers me. Does the writing get better?

Spoilers for a crown of swords I am reading WOT for the first time and just finished CoS. Why does everyone say this is the slog? It was one of my favorites in the series so far. So much happened in a book that is smaller than the ones before it. Lan comes back, Nanaeve loses her block, Elayne and Nanaeve get the bowl, the seanchan attack the white cloaks, Rand runs into Padan Fain, and Rand kills Sammael (although I don’t think he is actually dead. We didn’t exactly see it happen so I don’t think it did). Mat was hilarious in the book and had me cracking up.

My point is that a lot of posts on this sub had me really dreading getting to this part of the books and it is actually really good so far. This is seriously my favorite series of books so far and I’m very happy I had a friend recommend it to me.

So I've been thinking, and Davian unconsciously mutilating their faces ... It could just be that he did to them what they did to him, of course. But I think it might be a point in favor of the Davian = Caeden theory. The only time we see facial mutilation in the series is when Tal'makar kills someone and chooses to mutilate their body so that no one will no they died and realize he's a shape-shifter when he turns up. It seems to be something very ingrained in him, doing that. I think that, when Davian was having his face cut into, it awoke some sort of subconscious memory of this. So his unconscious reaction was to mutilate them as he killed them.

2. Minor spoilers for Wheel of Time, too. &gt;!I think the Venerate are a great spin in the Forsaken. It's obviously a conscious decision, what with all the other homages to the Wheel of Time (I mean the *Aryth Ocean ffs*, and that's just the most obvious one). I really like the idea of how whereas in WoT, the Forsaken were chosen for their selfishness, in Licanius the Venerate were chosen for how *good* they were (and then subsequently corrupted and fooled unto a path of a supposed "greater good"). It's really a great twist on the concept.!&lt;

Alright people with photographic memory, it's your time to shine. (Possible spoilers about Rand and Tam)

&amp;#x200B;

First time post, so sorry if my reddiquette isn't the best.

I have a great Christmas gift planned for my Father, who was the one to introduce to me to the WoT series when I was just a young wool headed lad. I have never met my biological Father but my mom married this great guy 4 years after I was born, that would raise me and teach me to be a proper man (not rough, tough, and emotionless, more like responsibility, honor, and loyalty) with out even a second thought. So you could imagine when I read the books and experienced Rand and Tams relationship, I instantly made the personal connection.

Now to the point of the Christmas present, I know there is a part in the series some where Lan is talking to Rand about Tam. There is a specific quote from him that really shows that it doesn't matter who's blood is in you, it's the proper raising of the child that really counts. I want to get this quote engraved or written, on something or another (haven't gotten that far in the plan yet). So I know there has to be some fantasy novel fan out there with much better memory then mine who could possibly remember what conversation I'm talking about or maybe even the general time line of the books.

\*I think it could be the time Lan was training Rand on top of the tour in ?Shienar? when the wind knocks Rands footing. Not even sure if thats close though\*

What assumptions might we have all wrong? [spoilers all] We only know the world through flawed narrators, and throughout the series we learn how naive the people of Randland are about things they took as rock-solid truth. Remember when, in your first read-through you assumed Ba'alzamon was the DO because all the characters thought he was?

We readers have a pretty good understanding of how things work, but what assumptions do you think/suspect we just might be... wrong about? Or, do you have an alternate head-cannon you like to entertain? (one that's not refuted by evidence from the books)

I'm not referring to *unexplained* things (e.g. the pipe scene). I'm thinking of ideas that we all take as fact only because the in-universe characters do.

Example: I was seriously entertaining the idea that time isn't in fact cyclical in the WoT universe until it was made explicit by The Dragon's battle with the DO.

Finally... I started WoT 18 years ago. I re-read it many times as new books were released - then got divorced just as Crossroads of Twilight came out and found myself in a messy place so never made it past Winter’s Heart, even though I bought them all as they were released. Just finished my 6th reading of WH and about to start CoT for the first time. Haven’t been this excited in ages.

A question about the Dragon Completed this series when AMOL came out, and still love going back to read it now and then. The rich lore and mythos built by RJ have been simply amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

But there are a few things about the Dragon that I have never quite understood. Listing them out below, in no particular order:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Why is it that the Dragon is the only one who can face the Dark One? Is it ever explained anywhere in the books, on what makes the Dragon so special, that he alone must be the one to face the DO in battle? It cant be just strength in channeling, as Rand does not seem to be channeling in any way when fights DO. Would a normal channeler be just wiped away or something if they tried to go into the Pit of Doom or tried to fight DO?

&amp;#x200B;

2) It is said that as the WoT turns the Pattern repeats certain events. So is the AoL and Third Age supposed to happen every time? And more importantly is the cycle of the Dragon and the Dragon Reborn supposed to follow each other, with the Dragon not being able to seal the Bore correctly, and needing the Dragon Reborn to do it?

&amp;#x200B;

3) In the AoL, what exactly made LTT the Dragon? Is there a set of prophecies that follow him, like the Karaethon Cycle describes the coming of Rand?

RJ ripped off Dune Totally. A simple google search will reveal a TON of results discussing how RJ's books took elements from Dune that at some point you have to say where there's smoke there's fire. Here's his response:



&gt;ROBERT JORDAN:
&gt;
&gt;No,  there was no intention to make any similarities between Dune and my  writings. And I am certainly a big fan of the original Dune novel.  Although I doubt if I've read it since it first came out!

I call total BS. "I doubt if I've read it since it first came out"? Right. Yet you felt compelled to add that little disclaimer for no reason at all huh. I enjoyed WoT but at least man up about it. I'm a "big fan" of Dune too, and I know damn well every single detail of what books I've read from it, how many times I've read them, and when. 'Fess up RJ, you basically ripped off a ton of stuff from a dead author and then denied it. (bit of irony there now)

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't buy this "common elements" argument I've seen RJ fans post. The similarities go way beyond that, are too close, and have been noticed by far too many people for years. Ya ripped him off Bob! Now that you and Frank are sharing space in the NYT Bestseller's afterlife you got a lot of 'esplaining to do, Lucy!

Do you read books with all of the POV character's being of the opposite sex? A friend recently asked me for book recommendations and I gave him a few, but always inclued a warning if they were told purely from a female  character's point of view. Only afterwards, I wondered why I did that. It never bothered me (as a woman) whether the main character was male or female, I very much enjoy reading both, so why did I feel the need to warn him?

Out of curiosity, would you (as a man)  read books that have only female main protagonists? I don't talk about books like ASOIAF, or WoT or other ensemble casts with both men and woman, I mean books that have only female POVs? (Irrespective of whether the author was a man or a woman).

And vice versa, as women, would you read books with male only POV characters? (Which I guess is almost unavoidable...especially when reading fantasy.)

New to YA Fantasy. Looking for recommendations based on my taste in "Adult" Fantasy I'd love to get some recommendations for YA standalones and series based on my taste in "Adult" Fantasy.

I love: ASOIAF, Malazan 1-6, Mistborn, The Farseer Trilogy, and The Lies of Locke Lamora

I like and/or enjoyed but haven't finished: Discworld, WoT, Broken Earth, and Tigana

The only YA series I can recall really enjoying was Harry Potter, which I read to completion. I'm a big fan of well-written dialogue and comic relief, not such a fan of gratuitous violence. I'm not averse to realism, but I don't find reading about sociopaths to be particularly interesting.

[Here's] a link to my Goodreads profile if that helps tailor your recommendations. You're also welcome to add me as a friend over there!

[Online][Discord/GSheet][MST/GMT-7][5e] DM looking for Players for Wheel Of Time Inspired One-Shot I’m looking to DM a homebrew-ish one shot inspired by the Wheel of Time series. First issue: The time window is fairly limited. We will be playing late night December 21, 22, 28, or 29 starting a 10:00pm MST (GMT -7) and going for 3-4 hours. If everyone is enjoying it, we may go to a second session. If you are not available late night on at least one of those days please do not respond.

The play is designed for 4-6 adventurers that are around Level 5, though I’m open to scaling up or down depending on the groups desires. Absolutely no knowledge of the books is needed, but there are NPC’s and enemies based on characters from the book so if you’re a WoT geek like me you might enjoy it. If you want to make WoT inspired characters, that would be awesome.

The hope is to get everyone in a discord chat for the next little bit to collaborate on scheduling, talk character creation, and more. The one-shot will be a mix of obstacles and combat so every race, class, background is welcome! Homebrew for characters is open subject to approval, but highly recommended! As long as it’s not ridiculously OP, I’m open to it.

About me: I’m a novice GM in my mid-30’s with about a year of experience as a player. I have GM’ed a few one shots in person and online previously that went well, but don’t expect Matt Mercer. I can be fairly serious as a DM, but I love levity and fun with PC’s, so any personality type is welcome. I just ask that everyone be respectful, mature, and okay with dice not rolling your way.

If you are available on at least one of the day’s listed, send me a message on Reddit or discord at wookiechops#3787.

A D&amp;D like book, but with deeper characters and story? I'm looking for everything the Salvatore books offer (an epic quest with **magical loot, monsters, adventure**) but with the depth of character and story more like Game of Thrones, etc. What would you recommend? Already tried WoT, LOTR.

What new series should I gift my WoT loving Dad? Hi!

My Dad is a 75 year old fantasy lover who also happens to be impossible to shop for. He loved the Wheel of Time series, Dark Tower, mostly anything Stephen King, obviously LotR and GoT, and oddly enough The Divergence series.. Last year I bought him the first book of The Faithful and the Fallen series by John Gwynne, and he devoured it and bought the rest of the series himself.

He likes long, thick books, and doesn't mind a slow burn. Lots of characters and story lines. Preferably a series with at least 5 books (and hopefully already out.. he HATES waiting on authors..haha)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks in advance!

WoT: Reading the first boosk, synopsisis of the middle ones, and read the last 3? I am re-reading Wheel of Time now, and I am currently enjoying book 1. I don't really remember anything from my first readthrough (20 years ago), but I do remember beeing really bored with the series and not finishing it. (I dont know where I ended, maybe 7 or 8?

&amp;#x200B;

I remember that I really enjoyed the worldbuilding and the overall story, but the books just got too slow.  This time I want to know how it ends!   If I get bored in the middle (again), is it an ok compromise to just read synopsises of the middle books and start again on book 11? Witch books can i skip, and, where can I find good synopsises?

Please help me find a new epic fantasy series. Severe DNF syndrome after WoT 😞 Hello friends,

&amp;#x200B;

I finished Wheel of Time (WoT) about 2 months ago and have been in a severe reading slump exacerbated by DNF'ing books simply because I'm not feeling into them. I'm hoping you could recommend me an epic fantasy series, hopefully multiple books (not just a duology or trilogy) with world changing stories, character and story driven, strong protagonist and antagonist, could be chosen one (I love a good chosen one story!), medieval fantasy setting with good magic system (I don't think I'm into flintlock or grimdark but I'm not sure yet.  I really enjoy medieval settings though).

&amp;#x200B;

**Really liked:**

* Stormlight Archive
* Wheel of Time
* A Song of Ice and Fire

&amp;#x200B;

**DNF**  (these are perfectly good books, I just couldn't get into them. no offense to fans of the series):

* Mistborn (halfway through first book)
* Lightbringer (90% of first book)
* Witcher (second short story)
* Malazan (second chapter)
* Six of Crows (first few pages)
* First Law (first chapter)
* Riyria Revelations (partway through second book)
* The Name of the Wind (about 7 chapters in)

&amp;#x200B;

Rant: Giving up Wheel of Time - convince me I'm wrong? Having been introduced to Brandon Sanderson via his first three Stormlight Archive books (which were stunning), I was hoping to enjoy WOT enough to make it to his highly-acclaimed ending to But I think I'm gonna go start Mistborn, instead.  I just can't handle Robert Jordan's derivative writing.

I'm 1/3 of the way into the first book, and I promised myself one more lousy cliche and I'm done.  It was the ship's captain talkin like he be a pirate that did it for me.  After the overly-placating and reassuring innkeeper character, I thought I'd had enough, truly I did, oh yes indeed.  Not to mention that virtually every character is ripped straight out of LOTR.  I fail to see much originality, and Jordan tells a fairly boring story, to boot.  Convince me I'm wrong?

Wanting to start a world-exploration campaign in the Wheel of Time universe. Suggestions on game systems? TLDR I want a narrative, roleplaying system with a light combat system to run a Wheel of Time themed campaign. Preferrably more sandbox game than a super railroaded campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read The Wheel of Time series 5+ times and I love the world. I've also been playing D&amp;D since I was \~10 years old and tried a few different systems. My brother and I even designed our own system. As a player,  I love world exploration most, and just experiencing the world that you're being a part of.


What I want is a system that is focused on roleplaying and exploration, but that has a simple combat system to go with it that is still tactical with a map.  I would also like a system for magic, like in WOT, that is representative, but not restrictive in what you can do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of doing something like Fate, but with a slightly more robust combat system underneath it, or maybe Savage Worlds adapted to Wheel of Time, focusing more on the roleplaying, exploration, and social encounters than the combat.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on RPG systems that would work for this?

A new reader Today I was browsing in Barns &amp; Nobel looking for some new books. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a young girl kneel where the Wot books were. She pulled out the first. I couldn't help it. Told her I have read it at least a dozen times, it's been picked up for a show, one of the best series I have ever read. She tucked it under her arm and walked away. Another convert.

(Spoilers LoC) The way the girls treat Mat is horrible. - They still haven't thanked him for saving their asses in Tear.


- Their very first instinct is to try to use him as much as possible.


- Nynaeve's first response to Mat's admittedly arrogant behavior is to physically assault him to the point he starts limping.  I missed the class on WoT etiquette where people are taught that violence is an appropriate response to brash behavior.


- Elayne seems to think she's entitled to his medallion no questions asked; she wants it so it should be hers.


- Mat actually humbles himself when he sees the other Aes Sedai ignoring Egwene, he bows and loudly shows her respect her position should be due.  As soon as he leaves her immediate thought is that he'll only cause trouble in Ebou Dar and that hopefully Elayne and Nynaeve can teach him manners.  Oh, and that she wants to separate him from his own army so she can manipulate it as she wants.


- Not even Aviendha shows him much respect (although she's miles better than the others) despite knowing firsthand that he was instrumental in defeating the Shaido at Cairhien and singlehandedly took down Couladin.


- Not related to Mat, but what the fuck is up with Elayne just assuming it's a foregone conclusion that she can Bond Rand and FORCE him to swear obediance oaths without him having any input?  Up until this book Elayne wasn't too bad of a character, now she's acting like a complete bitch.


Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve can get fucked tbh, even though I usually like Nynaeve despite her faults.

My 2018 year in review (Dear mods, I didn't see a megathread for these yet so I'm just posting it. Hope I'm not jumping the gun!)

I thought it would be fun to look back at all the books(and audio books!) I finished in 2018. Turns out to have been a lot more than I expected! I am also pleasantly surprised by the variety of things. I mostly stick to scifi/fantasy so it was nice to see a fair bit of stuff outside that!
Feel free to post your own year in review or comments on mine.


In approximate order of completion, I read/listened to:

* Winter's Heart (WoT#9) by Robert Jordan
* Turtles All the Way Down by John Green
* Oathbringer (Stormlight#3) by Brandon Sanderson
* Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig
* The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin
* The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin
* The Princess Diarist by Carrie Fisher
* The Star Wars: Aftermath Trilogy by Chuck Wendig
* 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami
* The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury
* Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer
* Uprooted by Naomi Novik
* Mistborn: The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson
* The Broken Earth Trilogy by NK Jemisin
* An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green
* The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas
* We Are Legion - We Are Bob (Bobiverse#1) by Dennis E Taylor
* Artemis by Andy Weir

Might have one or two more in me before the end of the year : )

Some reflections:

   I really enjoyed all the YA books I read which really speaks to the growth of this once commonly dismissed genre. Those Green brothers really know how to tug on my heart strings. I particularly enjoyed An Absolutely Remarkable Thing as a wonderful modern &gt;!first contact!&lt; story. And I can't believe The Hate U Give was Angie Thomas' debut book. That was powerful. Both of those books were just what I needed to read in this year of upsetting national and global events.

  I reeeeeeeeally need to read more Le Guin. Both books I read  were some of the best books I've ever read. The Dispossessed in particular is probably my favorite book of all time now. I'm not usually one to reread books, but I want to start just so I can read this book again.

  The Broken Earth Trilogy deserved all those awards it won. I don't want to say too much since it's still new and I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. But in terms of style &gt;!It was soo cool to see have most of it told from a second person perspective! You never see that and it was really cool. !&lt;
I really want to read more Naomi Novik. I like her modern style of fairy tale a lot.

Artemis was a lot of fun and totally what I wanted from an Andy Weir book. If you want more like The Martian but with a badass female protagonist living on a moon base then I highly recommend it.


Goals &amp; wishes for 2019:

   I want to keep working on the series that I started, Mistborn, Bobiverse, Southern Reach(Annihilation). I also want to keep going with some previously started series WoT, Three Body Problem. It would also be nice to read another Murakami book. Kafka on the Shore seems to be a popular one. Also Anathem by Neal Stephenson. Still gotta read that.

  I have a few other series on my shelf to start, but I don't want to commit to any of them here, but I guess I'll list a few of them so you can help convince me to start them :) Leviathan Wakes, The Blade Itself, City Stained Red. Who knows? Maybe Rothfuss and Martin and Scott Lynch put out their next books and all my best laid plans will fall to pieces! (no throwing shade at these authors in the comments please)

Comics/Graphic novels:

  I also got into comics and graphic novels in 2018 and I'd like to continue with that. I read Watchmen and Maus, two critically acclaimed graphic novels, and they were excellent. I also became totally obsessed with Saga. Saga is taking a break for a year, but I look forward to it's return in 2020. I'm currently working on Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. I also read a smattering of other things like the short Mockingbird run by Chelsea Cain, Star Wars: Tag and Bink, East of West's first trade paperback. I liked all of it so consider me hooked! Really excited to get more into this medium. I want to finish East of West and I also hope to read Y The Last Man and (to continue my Brian K Vaughn train) start Paper Girls too. I also want to start Monstress. And I recently picked up Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns run. Definitely looking forward to that. Any graphic novels/comics fans out there? What are your must reads?

That's all for me!

Happy reading and Happy New Year!

Path of Daggers (Spoilers) Ch19 Egwene is my favorite love-hate character in WoT. I just love how she put the hall sitters in there place. I haven't read much past this point. She could have easily been the most amazing character of the series, if only she treats Rand better.

The Way of Kings: Thoughts and Musings So I recently finished *The Way of Kings* for the first time. As a background, I've read *Elantris*, *Warbreaker*, *Mistborn* 1st Era, and *The Emperor's Soul*. I also read *Wheel of Time* last year, and I agree that in some ways, *Stormlight Archive* is the spiritual successor of it.

**What I don't like**

* In general, I think the book will be so much better, stronger, and heavy hitting if it's trimmed down to around 700-800 pages. Some chapters end in pretty inconsequential and uneventful note, they lack the page-turning factor I really enjoyed from *Mistborn* trilogy.
* Pacing and writing-wise, I feel WoK falls to the same trappings of WoT: repetitive writing and character tics. There are around 70 occurrences of raised eyebrows. Dalinar's chapters can be repetitive as well with the same mullings and broodings every time to 'unite them.'
* Characters kinda reserve the vital information until it's almost too late. Adolin, Dalinar, Navani mean to talk with each other but it's always, "There's no time now, let's talk about this later." It can be frustrating to read. Elhokar's trust issues in Dalinar can be solved half book faster if Dalinar being much more straightforward regarding his plans and intentions. Shallan starts seeing the geometric headed beings from Shadesmare even before she steals the Soulcaster, she should've talked about it sooner with Jasnah.
* Battle scenes in Dalinar's chapters are also repetitive. Dalinar and Adolin go to battle, go mad with their Shardblades, burn some eyes, leave the battle with their Plates cracking and leaking stormlight. Rinse and repeat. Even during the climax it's pretty much the same action save for Kaladin's acrobatics.

**What I'm unsure about/mixed feelings**

* Since the settings of the story are really stationary, it gave the illusion of static/slow plot progression. I know it isn't really the case but it's my reading experience. On other hand, it's an interesting writing choice from Sanderson's part.
* Dalinar's visions gives me *Wheel of Time* throwbacks during Mat's chapters. Sometimes it's interesting, but some other times it's not really.
* With everyone saying "fuck Moash" everywhere in reddit, I couldn't trust him from his very appearance.
* Interludes. Some of them have really fascinating bits of worldbuilding, but in general I failed to see their relevance in the bigger narrative. Perhaps in later books?
* Wit/Hoid being witty can be cringy. He's so much better when he's not trying to be a smartass and engaging in deeper conversations instead.
* I noticed that Syl is always missing whenever Kaladin is in action and his spheres always turning dun, so I figured that she's not a windspren pretty early. So when's her first chronological appearance then? I noticed there's a quirky rainspren during Kaladin's flashback in Hearthstone and a windspren during his time in Amaram's army. These two are my best guesses.
* What do the chasmfiends eat? They're massive so I guess they need colossal amount of daily intake. Also when they turn into chrysalis, do they emerge as the form that Dalinar and Adolin fight? Or is that the juvenile form that will turn into chrysalis?
* Where do the wood and logs come from? Almost all Rosharan plants in this book are small buds and grasses that withdraw themselves during highstorms. Are they Soulcast? Or exclusively come from Shin?
* I don't get the complaint that there's no sex or sexual drives in Sanderson's books. There are whores everywhere. Kabsal may or may not have hots for Shallan as he gets pretty touchy. Navani and Dalinar have years of sexual tension, and in the last chapters they're depicted cuddling, perhaps after sex. It's not a good or bad thing per se, it's just I don't get the complaint. Sex is there, but it's often only implied and not central to the narrative, and I'm absolutely okay with that.

**What I LOVE**

* In general, I find the symmetrical structuring and poetry are great writing choices from Sanderson's part.
* My complaint with *Wheel of Time* was that the depiction of strong, independent women was often overbearing, manipulative, and divisive. in TWoK, I love the depiction of women in power. Both Jasnah and Navani radiate the strong aura and charisma without having to constantly raise their voice and bully people into submission.
* Bizarre and expansive worldbuilding is my jam, so naturally Roshar is my poison (or antidote? Pun intended). I love that a lot of creatures (cremlings, Parshendi, chasmfiends) are basically crustaceans with exoskeleton. The Palaneum and Shattered Plains are also so vivid in my mind.
* I think Sanderson was inspired with *Final Fantasy* aesthetics to some degree. Gemstones/crystals as magical sources of power? Check. Oversized magic swords? Check. Glowing trance/limit break state? Check.
* I have a weak spot for spear wielders. Dragoons from *Final Fantasy*, Trull Sengar from *Malazan*, Matrim Cauthon from *Wheel of Time*, they tend to be honourable badasses. I'm glad I got to meet Kaladin.
* Speaking of Kaladin's depression, I think Sanderson absolutely nailed it. I am diagnosed with similar condition, so Kaladin's struggles with guilt and shame helped me to reflect on my own struggles.
* My common complaint with litRPG genre is that usually their video game mechanics are way too on the nose. In TWoK, I love that these elements are there but subtly woven into the narrative. I particularly love that they loot from dead soldiers and chasmfiends for gems and equipments. Also Kaladin knobweed deals with the apothecary gives me crafting/item gathering vibes from RPG.
* I enjoyed Shallan's chapters the most, especially whenever they debate over philosophy and lore.
* *The Stormwall* might be my favourite chapter. I love the archetype of Hanged Man/Jesus/Odin, and the fact that Kaladin is literally forged and reborn by highstorm is metal af. From now on, Kaladin is Spear Jesus in my head. No one, not Almighty himself can change my mind.
* Kaladin and his crew making Parshendi armours is straight up *Monster Hunter* craziness.
* Lopen and his cousin jokes. Also his last lines in the book cracked me up: that if he's glowing, ladies will look over the fact that he's got only one arm.
* My usual complaint with past Sanderson's books is that he usually rushed the ending and tried to cram as many answers as possible. The pacing is usually pretty off during the epilogue. I love the fact that he took extra 50 pages to address a lot of things during the fifth part. The only downside is that it leaves me wanting, since the book will be so much better if the earlier chapters delivered in similar energy and pacing.
* The last scene of Bridge Four where they're having a night stew together while exchanging banter gives me really cozy and wholesome feelings.
* Parshmen are Voidbringers? Yeah, didn't see that coming.
* Shallan killed her own father? Yeah, didn't see that coming too.
* Taravangian is the one behind Szeth all along? His 'humanitarian' hospital is behind the records of dying men's last words? I was wondering the whole time how they can be so precise with the premortem recording time. Dammit, Sanderson, absolutely didn't see them coming!
* I love Wit's speech/discourse regarding the concept of novelty during the epilogue. It gives me *The Emperor's Soul* vibes. In meta sense, it kinda reads like Brandon himself saying to us: "Hey, I'm trying something new here, but novelty itself might be overrated. Let's rethink the value of the things by its own merit."

In general, I think SA manages to evades the old trappings of WoT while falls to the similar failings. I really wanted to love this book more and gave it full 5 stars, but the pacing and repetition kept killing my excitement. In the end of the day, I gave this book **4.25/5**. That said, I'm excited to read *Words of Radiance* as I heard that it's even a lot better than TWoK.

About resuming book 9 after 4 months I have read wot till book 8. Was going to start book 9, but things happened. Have been completely out of touch for the last 4 months. Now I want to resume from book 9. How should I go about it ? I fear I have to start from square one, which feels as bad as gaining progress but forgetting to press the save button 😣

As an aspiring Fantasy writer, should I continue Eye of The World if I hate it? I'm currently working my way through classic fantasy novels trying to broaden my knowledge of the genre. I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson, who talks about WoT a LOT, and so I thought I'd pick up Eye of the World.

&amp;#x200B;

I recall reading this book 7-8 years ago, and now wonder how I ever got through it. I'm at chapter 16 and woefully bored, but perhaps I'm spoiled from just coming off a re-read of ASoIAF.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy reading Fantasy and want to write fantasy, but it seems to familiarize myself with the genre at large I have to read some very dull books. Should I power through? I've read various posts on other subreddits explaining that I'll know by the time I finish book 3 whether I love it or hate it, but right now that feels like being asked to watch paint dry.

Alternative Interpretation (SPOILER) So Here goes a long explanation of what exactly I think is going on in the Wheel of Time, I mean really going on. This Concerns the Creator, DO, Wheel, Pattern, Taveren, Rand, Ish, and Lanfear.

&amp;#x200B;

First, this was kickstarted by my first reread of the series. Nynaeve, my favorite character, was originally really annoying on first read through and then gets good halfway through. On second read through I realized how hilarious she is, even at the beginning. I was floored by how my perception of certain words was drastically changed just by knowing Nynaeve, like really knowing who she was and what she would do. She feels like one of the most complete characters of all time. And she is completely oblivious of herself. Her views are so warped that I literally burst out laughing reading her parts. Realizing there may be more hidden beneath the surface I started digging. I began to see inconsistencies everywhere. But on closer inspection it was simply a PoV being misinformed due to bad information. Getting to Dashiva's sections, my jaw dropped. The way hes clearly a spy and a bad guy was so glaring! Like it was so not subtle that i couldn't believe I didn't catch it the first time. So I went back to the start and analyzed what about the passages with him made me tunnel vision crazy despite the CLEAR SIGNS of bad guy spy. It's slow and subtle at first. Then you somewhat get used to him acting that way and **ITS NO LONGER SUSPICIOUS.** So then Jordan slowly raises the bar again until finally he unexpectedly tries to kill Rand. Bravo Jordan.

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind

&amp;#x200B;

I have a very unique view of what is actually happening in a good portion of the books. I base this on evidence from the books and from my own philosophical endeavors.

Here are my assertions:

1. The Wheel can never be broken and is actually more like a gyroscope.
2. Free Will is more important than literally anything.
3. Lanfear is really TDO and created the Bore on purpose.
4. There is no Creator and there is no TDO. There is only the Wheel and Pattern.
5. Ishamael is a Champion of The Wheel not a champion of TDO. He does pretend to be TDO during the outside the pattern fight, but he is The Wheels double agent.
6. The Entire battle with TDO is a lie.
7. 3 Become 1 actually refers to the only way to seal the Bore. LTT, Ishamael, and Lanfear all combine their souls together and fix the pattern.
8. Rand does not light the pipe, The Wheel lights it for him. Also other secrets in the last scene.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The guidebook is considered broadly canonical and Robert Jordan provided substantial amounts of never-before-seen information for it. However, Jordan's intent was for the book to have been written by a historian of Rand al'Thor's time (albeit an extremely well-informed one) and he wished to ensure that the book would be prone to some of the problems of bias and guesswork that afflict "real" history as well.To this end, Jordan sometimes refused to answer questions from Teresa Patterson or suggested that she "guess" the answers.

I feel this entire guidebook is a giant red herring. It is a fantastic idea and one that only the briallint Robert Jordan could pull of. I really think he is one of the most brilliant storytellers of all time. the completeness of Ulysses comes to mind when i read WoT.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 The Wheel can never be broken and is actually more like a gyroscope.

&gt;“**The wind** was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning”

Straight forward. The Wheel of Time will never stop, it has always been turning and it always will. Even if TDO were to breaks free, it would be unable to stop, much less break the wheel. TDO is able to touch the wheel, it can slow down time near the bore but it can’t stop time completely.

&gt;“The One Power comes from the True Source, the driving force of creation, the force the Creator made to turn the Wheel of Time.“

&amp;#x200B;

The WoT is powered by the True Source. Logically then, if the True Source was destroyed or made powerless, then the Wheel would lose its power source. An indirect way to stop the wheel. This seems like the true reason for the Taint.

&gt;*“Saidin* is fouled by the touch of the Dark One, like water with a thin slick of rancid oil floating on top. The water is still pure, but it cannot be touched without touching the foulness“

&amp;#x200B;

The fouling of Saidin does not affect Saidin or Saidar. It also does not affect the Wheel or its ability to turn. I think the fouling is just simply a layer of True Power covering Saidin. The madness it brings is similar to the madness brought on by repeated use of the TP. The TP and OP are fundamentally incompatible it seems. I would assume someone can’t channel both at the same time. It is mentioned that trying to channel the OP at the pit would destroy a person immediately. Although, just like soap for oil and water, Callandor exists to bring the TP and OP together. Potentially, Callandor also exists as the only way to mix the TP and OP which would allow the TP to directly affect the Wheel.

&gt;Gyroscope - a device consisting of a wheel or disk mounted so that it can spin rapidly about an axis that is itself free to alter in direction. The orientation of the axis is not affected by tilting of the mounting; so gyroscopes can be used to provide stability or maintain a reference direction in navigation systems, automatic pilots, and stabilizers.

The wheel is effectively a cosmic gyroscope or cosmic north star for the pattern to be weaved to and used as reference so it can never get too off track.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"men and women planned the future, **believing** they knew truth. They planned, and the Pattern **absorbed** their plans, weaving toward the future **foretold**."

The Pattern is made of consciousness. As soon as a person make a conscious decision, the Pattern immediately changes and the Wheel reacts to maintain reality.

&gt;There is always room for small changes, but sometimes the Pattern simply won't accept a big change, no matter how hard you try...

Combining these two ideas, I do not think Rand could have ended the Pattern on Dragonmount. The moment Rand decided to destroy everything the Pattern would absorb his decision and the Wheel would immediately react in some way to prevent stop him just like it did with Lanfear.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 Free Will is more important than literally anything.

The Biggest Theme in the story is that Free Will is more important than literally anything. This is Rand’s ultimate decision that the Wheel thanks him for. With free will and enough time comes certain inevitabilities…

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 Lanfear is really TDO and created the Bore on purpose.

If you are The Wheel and you are saying above all else

Rule #1 Free Will

Go.

Now the Wheel weaves and it weaves hard, but since it made the rules it has to follow them and this leads to certain eventualities with enough time. One of them is that **someone** is **eventually** going to **want** to come knocking. (Lucifer)

&amp;#x200B;

Who better or more power hungry then Lanfear. Evil had existed in AoL. Lanfear was actively and publicly trying to steal LTT away from Ilyena. That is some pretty evil stuff. In public calling for a husband to leave his wife for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Lanfear is the reason for the Bore, not TDO. When she refuses to let Rand see into her mind it is because she does not want him to know she did it on purpose and she is TDO. She knew that there was the chance to have unlimited power if she Bored into the Pattern. The Pattern is simply souls and she was knowingly attempting to harness people’s souls to tap into a new energy source. By utterly destroying a soul it cannot be reclaimed and recycled in the Pattern but gives off a tremendous amount of energy that also begins to unravel the fabric of reality.

&amp;#x200B;

She was the first to proclaim for the shadow and the DO. She created the concept of the DO or at least CHAMPIONED it. As others were going mad she was encouraging their delusions giving potential allies a mascot to rally behind. She never seems to be afraid or even beneath the DO. Its only on surface level as if she’s the leader of a cult nodding along to the BS her zealots are spouting off. Does this not agree?

&gt;“I serve.” Despite her words, she stood tall and defiant. “I serve the Great Lord of the Dark and none other. Forever!”

She is the great lord of the dark.

&gt;“For a moment Ba’alzamon stood alone, then suddenly there was a woman with him, clad all in white and silver.
&gt;
&gt;Shock hit Perrin. He could never forget a woman so beautiful. She was the woman from his dream, the one who had urged him to glory.
&gt;
&gt;An ornate silver throne appeared behind her, and she sat, carefully arranging her silken skirts. “You make free use of my domain,” she said.”

She just pops in makes a throne and sits down calling out her puppet that she has set up thinking he is TDO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“It was at that moment they heard the scream, thin with distance.
&gt;
&gt;Another scream came, more desperate than the first.”

The first meetings of characters are usually full of hidden gems and this is a big one. She is the best at playing the victim.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Some men,” she said, not raising her eyes from his hand, “choose to seek greatness, while others are forced to it. It is always better to choose than to be forced. A man who’s forced is never completely his own master. He must dance on the strings of those who forced him.”

She is the only true temptation for the Dragon.

**THE ONLY TIME THE LIGHT IS SEEN TO LOSE IS WHEN MORAINE SEES LANFEAR SUCCEED IN CONVERTING RAND.**

Plus she is the only one actively trying to bring him to shadow in earnest. The others say they are to appease TDO but she is the only one really making every move to convince rand to join her.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Selene’s eyebrows lifted; her dark eyes glittered at him, but her voice was soft. “Aes Sedai? I? No.”
&gt;
&gt;“I didn’t mean to offend you. I’m sorry.”

Remember to her that means servant of all and she is the polar opposite of that the most selfish power hungry soul ever created; TDO.

&amp;#x200B;

The Wheel couldn’t stop her but it did immediately come up with a plan.

Since Free Will exists someone will be powerful enough and with a big enough ego! to get to hold the box that says Blow Up World, there is no one one better or with more right than Lanfear, not even Ish. Since Free Will The Wheel can’t stop her from pressing the button, but the moment she consciously decides to press it The Wheel reacts and adapts to prevent Total Failure, resulting in the Bore and a partial hole in reality; a countdown to Total Failure instead of an instantaneous explosion. This Bore created TAR which Lanfear constantly tells others is her domain, because she created it indirectly, it literally is her domain even if she doesn't have complete control over it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *"Daughter of the Night, she walks again. The ancient war, she yet fights. Her new lover she seeks, who shall serve her and die, yet serve still. Who shall stand against her coming? The Shining Walls shall kneel. Blood feeds blood. Blood calls blood. Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be."*

She is the only Forsaken to get a Shadow Prophecy. That speaks volumes.

Her last scene

&gt;"He holds TDO between his fingers, needing only one squeeze to pinch the life-if it can be called that-away. Only one hand can save TDO. In this moment, I earn my reward. In this moment, I become highest on high"

No way she would save TDO. If she took control of Rand she would try to absorb TDO power.

&gt;"The barier between worlds have been broken here"

The seals are holding all the fractured realities from the bore apart.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\#4 There is no Creator and there is no TDO. There is only the Wheel and The Pattern.

&gt;“The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning”
&gt;
&gt;“This wind, it was not the ending. There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time.”

There are no beginnings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. So you can effectively think about the wheel as a constant then. It will never change. Never in the past and never in the future. It was never created. So there can be no Creator. There is no creator and there is no TDO. There is only the Pattern and the Wheel.

TDO doesn’t really make sense at all even. I mean when you look at the whole story so far up to this point what has it been about? A Boy who thinks the devil is after him. But at the end of the day the devil is just a man who thinks hes the devil. And then for the rest of the story it’s just a really strong man vs other strong devil worshipers. There is never Man vs the devil. Oh right and the other big part of the story is that everyone is slowly going crazy and the world is literally falling apart.

&gt;**The Wheel of Time weaves** the Patterns of the Ages, and **the** **threads it uses are lives**. It is not fixed, the Pattern, not always. If **a man** tries to **change** the direction of his life and **the Pattern** has room for it, **the Wheel just weaves on and takes it in.**

Furthermore I think the wind is direct evidence that the pattern is actively being changed through the creation of Ta'veren.

&amp;#x200B;

M'Hael with Demondred

&gt;He fought back, the air-warping aura of the TP wrapping him.

using the TP warps air creating ... wind in a way.



&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Born below the ever cloud-capped peaks that gave the mountains their name, the wind blew east... and beat at two men walking with a cart and horse ... For all that spring should have come a good month since...

The wind touches Rand and presumably Perrin and Mat to make them all Ta'veren and start the journey to Shayol Ghul.

&gt;Rand asserted his will, and the quivering stopped. People who had frozen in place resumed walking, and the comfortable chatter sprang up again. **SOFT WIND** blew down the walkway.

The wind is Rand, who is The Wheel of this reality, as he weaves.

\#5 Ishamael is a Champion of The Wheel not a champion of TDO. He does pretend to be TDO during the outside the pattern fight.

All Ish has done is try and hasten Tarmon Gaidon. All the Wheel has tried to do is prepare Rand for TG. The Wheel is pushing them both and Ish knows this. This by no means that Ish is a good guy he does some pretty bad things in the name of TDO. The Wheel needs its wound fixed and making TG happen as quick as possible is how it does this. The Wheel is the only logical reason why Ish is spit out of the Pattern at all. He is encouraged by The Wheel to help do his part (for the shadow) to bring about TG. He is dragged along just like Rand so together they can heal the wound that Lanfear created.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“That bleak stone spire, a dagger stabbing at the heavens, was the source of his desolation. He had never seen it before, but he knew it. The memory of it flashed away like quicksilver when he tried to touch it, but the memory was there. He knew it was there.
&gt;
&gt;Unseen fingers touched him, pulled at his arms and legs, trying to draw him to the mountain. His body twitched, ready to obey. His arms and legs stiffened, as if he thought he could dig his fingers and toes into the stone. Ghostly strings entwined around his heart, pulling him, calling him to the spire mountain. Tears ran down his face, and he sagged to the ground. He felt his will draining away like water out of a holed bucket. Just a little longer, and he would go where he was called. He would obey, do as he was told. Abruptly he discovered another emotion: anger. Push him, pull him, he was not a sheep to be prodded into a pen. The anger squeezed itself into one hard knot, and he clung to it as he would have clung to a raft in a flood.”

This is the first time Rand and Ish meet in Rands dream and Moridin pulls him towards Shayol

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Elan Morin Tedronai was a critically acclaimed philosopher and theologian who wrote several influential books, among them ***Analysis of Perceived Meaning****,* ***Reality and the Absence of Meaning*** and ***The Disassembly of Reason*****.**

&amp;#x200B;

These are all hints to his true hidden story.

* ***Analysis of Perceived Meaning****,*
* ***Reality and the Absence of Meaning***
* ***The Disassembly of Reason*****.**

He's taunting us to uncover his secrets.

Hesallam = Im sure there is some deeper meaning here im still digging though.

Aringar / Osingar =

&gt;"*chaos seemed to be welling up from nowhere, without cause.*
*It was during this time that such brutal sports as sha’je dueling came briefly into vogue. Sha’je duels, held at Qual, involved the use of left- and right-hand daggers, called respectively osan’gar and aran’gar, tipped with slow poison… In some parts of the world, in the years immediately preceding the final collapse into war, murder, rape and even torture became regular parts of many spectator sports."* Daggers used in an especially cruel knife fight where the daggers were tipped with slow poison."

They are the left and right handed weapons meaning they have parallel but separate purposes since one is supposed to be in the White Tower and the other in the Black Tower. They are supposed create chaos in the camps. their slow poison name has significant meaning.

Lanfear = Daughter of the Night

Cyndane = Last Chance; She is literally the last chance for victory for herself, TDO.

Ishamael = Betrayer of Hope

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Baalzemon = Heart of the dark / Soul of the dark; literally hes at the heart of the darkness Rand is fighting in the shadow world.

Moridin = Death. Rand is Life. You need both to create a soul.

Heartfang = This doesn't fit with the others. Fang is usually the Dragon. So I think this is a hint that Ish isnt really The bad guy while still being A bad guy. (see what i did there)

&amp;#x200B;

\#6 The Entire battle with TDO is a lie.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“What? Yes, exactly the point. It can’t be the Last Battle. Even if the Dragon Reborn seals the Dark One’s prison again as well as the Creator made it. Which I don’t think he can do.“

We are being told Tarmon Gaidon is a red herring.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“The DO used shadowed threads of the pattern - the possibilities that rippled from creation like waves from a dropped pebble in a pond - to create this.”

Many things here if Rand is to be believed and we must always question his senses but we will come back to this is a second.

&gt;“Rand could see it. His connection to the Pattern, the glimmering of **half-truths** and **shadowed ways**. This possibility… it could happen\*\*.\*\* It was one path the world could take. The DO here had won the LB and broke the wheel”

This is a big deal in all of the books and especially here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“You think I am the same youth that Ishamael tried so hard to frighten?”

Ironic since hes talking to Ish

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“The Dark One attacked. It was an attempt to tear Rand apart...”

&amp;#x200B;

Rand thinks the DO is attacking him.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“YOU MISTAKE. THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY YOU. THIS IS PREPARATION.
&gt;
&gt;For what?
&gt;
&gt;TO SHOW YOU THE TRUTH”

TDO is not the most trustworthy but he is at a direct contradiction to Rand. One of them is wrong and it’s most likely TDO.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, who says this is even the DO talking? Let’s go to Nynaeve’s POV

&gt;“His foot had touched the darkness. At that moment, he had frozen, and so had Moridin. They were like statues. The air howled around them, but did not seem to affect them like as it did Nynaeve.”

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Moridin is masquerading as the DO as he likes to do, ALL THE TIME. First of all, he has done it in the first three books so it’s a pretty fitting end for him to come full circle. Take the first dream Rand has in TeotW.

&gt;*“It is your destiny*, a voice whispered in his head, and the whisper was a thread in the pattern.”

A thread in the pattern just means a living soul and since Rand has not yet met Ishamael, it’s a clever way to introduce him to Rand. It also shows just how skilled Ish is at manipulating his form in TAR-like places.

This also in AmoL

&gt;“This attack wasn’t at his body, for he had no true body in this place, **just a memory of one.**”

Moridin wouldn’t have a true body either since his original body was destroyed.

&gt;“End this, Rand said
&gt;
&gt;END IT? THERE ARE NO ENDINGS, ADVERSARY.”

This doesn’t really make sense if it’s the DO. Rand isn’t really his adversary, he is trying to turn Rand to his side and make him his servant. This makes more sense if it is Moridin than if it is the DO. Moridin wants more than anything to be completely destroyed. Up till now the other sentences by the DO to Rand have been pretty levelheaded, but here he almost seems to lose his cool. Moridin would be thrown off by a comment like that since he wants nothing more than to end everything. Speaking of, the first sentences of their battle is

&gt;“The Dark One attacked. It was an attempt to tear Rand apart, to destroy him bit by bit. The Dark One sought to **claim** the very elements that made up **Rand’s essence**, then **annihilate** **them**...”

The first thing the D/M does is try to deconstruct Rand’s soul, combine it with himself and completely annihilate everything. This makes perfect sense for Moridin but not really the DO. He fails, then tried to cover it up when Rand called him out.

Step back and summarize the battle. (Rand Appears, Then begins battling TDO. TDO creates reality in front of Rand **showing him what to do.** Then when Rand creates reality he mimics the same places TDO has just picked. until they start watching TV together.)

TDO is trying to **incept** him the whole fight right from the start. Rand even questions why he keeps choosing the same places as TDO at one point then brushes it off. LATER ON HE EVEN STARTS TALKING IN ALL CAPS JUST LIKE TDO. Ish is trying to incept him the whole time. They are just building ever more complex and expansive Dreamshards while Ish is slowly tricking Rand.

&gt;"threads of light spiraled out, quivering like the strings of a harp. They **waited** to be woven"

Such bait.

&amp;#x200B;

But hes not TDO so he still has the limitations of Ish;

&gt;"and saw the nothing that was the dark one in the distance... A reminder that what Rand was seeing wasn't real?"

 He has to be in eyesight to channel. So hes off menacingly in the distance trying to blend in which allows Rand to disassociate from the fake reality somewhat by the strange logic of it.

&amp;#x200B;

\#7  "He shall hold a blade of light in his hands and the three shall be one"  actually does refers to the only way to seal the Bore, though its different than expected. LTT(willingly), Ishamael(super willingly), and Lanfear(unwillingly) all combine their souls together and fix the pattern.

This is kind of controversial since no one has even whispered about it, but let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *"The man who channels stands alone. He gives his friends for sacrifice. Two roads before him, one to death beyond dying, one to life eternal. Which will he choose? Which will he choose? What hand shelters? What hand slays? Blood feeds blood. Blood calls blood. Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be."*

This is a direct reference to the choice LTT has to make after he sacrifices Lanfear and Moridin. After Rand has removed him from his Soul. That's why Rand doesn't say Moridins third name at the start. He's greeting him as a friend.

Which will he choose could also be a reference to Rand choosing to steal Moridin's body and stay alive selfishly instead of die. I mean balance says he should get to be a little selfish if he wanted after doing all that.

&amp;#x200B;

What if Rand was two fused souls like Slayer or Perrin?

well one of the consequences of that is there would be 2 male souls inside him. And so if he were to try and join in a circle there would be some strange side effects, namely hes two in one. There are some strange caveats to the rules of circle linking.

&gt; With three exceptions, there must always be a greater number of women in the circle than there are men. These exceptions are a circle of one man and a one woman, two men and one woman, or two men and two women.

Why are these exceptions neccessary?

Well the first one is necessary so Rand and Nyneave can cleanse the source, easy.

The second exception is kind of a strange one? Does this ever happen outright in the series? I cant remember.

unless you count Rand and  LTT both linked with Nynaeve cleansing the source. HMM you might need a special rule for that.

The third exception is same as the second but with Moraine and Nynaeve and Rand and LTT at the Pit. HMM

&amp;#x200B;

What mechanism is responsible for squishing two souls together?

I believe that is how all the reincarnated forsaken are created.

TDO does it to Luc and Isam. But if wolf brothers are a form of Fused souls then it cant be exclusively evil.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Slayer is not a wolfbrother.

 Luc was the First Prince of Andor and brother of Tigraine Mantear, making him the blood uncle of Rand al'Thor and Galad Damodred, both sons of Tigraine.

 Gitara Moroso urged Luc to seek his glory in the Blight. It is speculated by many fans that this is where Luc and Isam met. They met in the Mountains of Dhoom and merged into something new.

&amp;#x200B;

Luc is the merger of two souls and so is Rand. "

One did live and one did die"

Luc died for Isam

LTT died for Rand

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What exactly is a wolfbrother? Someone who can communicate with wolves. Someone similar to Slayer or Rand but with a human soul and a wolf soul fused. Perrin's wolf soul is what allows him to talk to wolves and enter the wolf dream. Oh yeah his wolf's soul is named Young Bull.

&gt;"He could see it now, frozen in a moment. Gentle Perrin, always afraid of hurting someone... this day, he took the leash off the wolf. It had never belonged there anyways"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"Perrin ignored these and barreled after Slayer.
&gt;
&gt;Young Bull! Wolves. The Shadowbrothers are here! We fight!"

Perrin is not the wolf king, Young Bull is.

&gt;"In all of those moments, in all of those places, Perrin's hammer struck and Young Bull's fangs grabbed slayer by the neck"

Despite Chaos changing things, making certain decisions uncertain, and uraveling time and space, this moment, Perrin killing Slayer is a constant in all of time and all of space. A fused soul killing a fused soul. Kind of cool. If their souls are points in space that would be 4 points which could help triangulate their position in time and space and act as a lever for the wheel to set itself around.

&amp;#x200B;

 The prophecies of the Shadow regarding Perrin

&gt;*"Lo, it shall come upon the world that the prison of the Greatest One shall grow weak, like the limbs of those who crafted it. Once again, His glorious cloak shall smother the Pattern of all things, and the Great Lord shall stretch forth His hand to claim what is His. The rebellious nations shall be laid barren, their children caused to weep. There shall be none but Him, and those who have turned their eyes to His majesty."*

The only thing imprisoned is the 13 chosen and which of them is the greatest? Lanfear. This is describing when she attempts to steal the power from Rand in the pit after he tricks Moridin. Also referring Perrin, under compulsion worshiping her. I laugh at all the **HIM** and **HIS** cuz its Lanfear. I bet that would make her furious too, everyone assuming it has to be a guy.

&gt;*"In that day, when the One-Eyed Fool travels the halls of mourning, and the First Among Vermin lifts his hand to bring freedom to Him who will Destroy, the last days of the Fallen Blacksmith’s pride shall come. Yea, and the Broken Wolf, the one whom Death has known, shall fall and be consumed by the Midnight Towers. And his destruction shall bring fear and sorrow to the hearts of men, and shall shake their very will itself."*

The shadow prophecies are super distorted so I wouldnt be surprised if the One-Eyed Fool (Red Herring)is not actually Mat.

To me the first among vermin sounds more like Mat. Hes the prince of Ravens and the Fox

Types of Vermin:

The American crow, is widely hated by farmers because of crop depredation. (cousin of raven)

Some varieties of snakes and occasionally foxes.

Yup def about Mat.

So who is Him who will Destroy? Padan Fain!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the shadow prophecies are about actually about Perrin's fight with Lanfear and how Jordan structures his sentences shows the important part is the blacksmith part while the first two parts are just imagery.

The fallen blacksmith is Perrin and is referring to Lanfear using compulsion on him to try to make him kill Moraine.

&amp;#x200B;

Who is the one-eyed fool then?

The one eyed fool has to be Rand as hes blind to the actual battle. thinking hes fighting TDO. Plus everyone's calling him a fool constantly.

&gt;*"And then, shall the Lord of the Evening come. And He shall take our eyes, for our souls shall bow before Him, and He shall take our skin, for our flesh shall serve Him, and He shall take our lips, for only Him will we praise. And the Lord of the Evening shall face the Broken Champion, and shall spill his blood and bring us the Darkness so beautiful. Let the screams begin, O followers of the Shadow. Beg for your destruction!"*

Same here with the HIS and HIM. Funny cuz its Lanfear. Shes talking about when she tries to use compulsion on Perrin to kill Moraine.

Okay thank Sanderson for this one: He has said flat out the broken wolf is Hopper.

&gt;*Yea, and the Broken Wolf,* ***the one whom Death has known,*** *shall fall and be consumed by the Midnight Towers.*

It is clear hes dead. so broken doesn't mean dead.

&gt;*.And the Lord of the Evening shall face the Broken Champion, and shall spill his blood and bring us the Darkness so beautiful.*

&amp;#x200B;

"Her hair was jet black, as it had been when he'd first met her, and her face was familiar. it looked as it once had."

"She narrowed her eyes. "This might be the most important moment for mankind since we opened the Bore"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\#8 Rand does not light the pipe, The Wheel lights it for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to start this part off with one of my favorite Jordan Quotes;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"What have you done to them? Rand demanded.
&gt;
&gt;I LET THEM THINK THEY WON.
&gt;
&gt;MANY WHO FOLLOW ME DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

This is his goodbye to us. This is his challenge for us to hunt for his Easter eggs and uncover the true story that he has been secretly telling this whole time. He is brilliant and I think Sanderson was in on it the whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

OK so,

&amp;#x200B;

Sealing the bore is really LTT, Ish, and Lanfear combining souls to fix the Pattern. That would leave Rand's soul alone for the first time in his whole life (well in the womb he was his own soul).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By instinct he reached for the One Power to light it. He found nothing...He paused then smiled and felt an enormous relief

Rand's soul could never channel. Even in Moridin's body, his soul is what decides if he can channel or not as seen in all the forsaken being reborn. If he had been burned out he would feel an ache or longing but instead he feels relief. He had only ever been using LTT's  Saidin due to the soul fusing.

&gt;"Rand al'Thor-Just Rand al'Thor woke by himself"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In his right eye hung a single saa, black shaped like the dragons fang.

The price he paid to stay alive after sealing the bore. Free will exists so he had the choice to stay alive or die. He chose to live and this is his eternal reminder.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Moridin he thought. He's being cremated with full honors as the Dragon Reborn.

The soul of Moridin not Ish is being cremated, Ish's soul was used to heal up the bore. He may have chosen to let Moridin die so he could live.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He thought about that, and found himself laughing, riding south smoking his impossible pipe. **as he did so, a wind rose up around him.** around the man who **had** been called lord.

hes no longer a lord or has any power.Hes at the mercy of the wheel. Luckily the wheel owes him one so it looks out for him and makes his life comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"I wonder which one of them will follow me, he thought, then smiled deeper.
&gt;
&gt;~~Rand al'Thor~~  **Robert Jordan** Youve built up quite a swelled head, havent you? Assuming one, or more, would follow.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe none of them would... He found himself chuckling"

&amp;#x200B;

I follow you Robert.

Is Alcatraz and WoT worth it is I enjoy the Cosmere and Reckoneers books? Hi everyone,

I have thought about reading WoT for years, but have heard that the middle part of the series drags quote a bit... but when I find an author I really enjoy, it bothers me to not read their work.

Are the WoT books worth the investment overall? Does the ending make up for the slow bits in the middle?

More broadly, how are the Alcatraz books? Are they overly jokey (I know they are comedic, but how much so)?

Thanks in advance!

I just have to say... I love this series. I have never loved a series this much before. The story, the characters, the magic, the world...I'm almost done with book 10, and I find myself procrastinating more and more with this last book because I just don't want it to end.

What do I even read next? I'm seriously considering rereading Malazan immediately, but another part of me thinks I need to branch out again. Explore new worlds. Find a new love...

I've already read the typical recommendations: ASOIAF, WoT, Stormlight Archives, Red Rising, King Killer's, Licanius, Gentleman Bastards, Broken Earth, Raven's Shadow,...

Give me your densest, most expansive and interesting fantasy/sci-fi series you've ever read! I'm going to be in serious withdrawals from Malazan here shortly.

I've just finished The Shadow rising Hello community of r/WoT !

I discovered this book series in January and to be honest I didn't know what to expect, all I knew it was fantasy. In the beggining there was a small struggle with getting used to reading in English  and quickly getting overwhelmed by all the names. Heh. It took me three months to finish the  first book (I read other books when i didn't feel like reading this) but after like 2 thirds of it I couldn't stop reading it and quickly finished it.
The second book gave me a thought that this series COULD be better than The song of ice and fire, which I had read(not in english mind you).
The third one convinced me to buy all the remaining books.
There is not a lot to say about the fourth one, I was already in love.

So far, my favourite character is Mat, I really like his personality and that many people seem to underrate him. I can't wait to read something about those items he got in Rhuidean.
I think he is gonna marry a Saenchan woman because he is supposed to marry some nine moon something and there was somewhere         a mention of it and it was connected to Saenchan.

Apart from Mat, my second favourite is Egeanin and how she was learning about Aes Sedai. I would like to see what exactly she asked them. I love when an enemy finds out that opponents might not be as evil as he was told and changes his point of view, which is exactly what happened in Tanchico. Really looking forward to every Egeanin chapter. I hope she is not a secondary character and and she will be important later on.

I don't like Nynaeve's behaviour most of the time, hope she changes for better. I wish there will be a moment when Egwene stops calling Rand 'Woolheaded idiot' etc. and realises Rand isn't 12 yo boy. These wanna be Aes Sedai are certainly not my favourites, excluding Elayne, she is OK.

This is my theory. When i found out about blight to the north of Aiel Waste i thought that if Saenchan is northward enough it could have a blight as well.

I deeply apologise for any mistakes, I'm not a native English person.

Right now I'm opening The fires of Heaven. ;)

Is 'Crossroads of Twilight' still an entertaining book even despite its flaws? Obviously since I'm only on Eye of the World right now I have a ways to go before I reach Crossroads but from what I've seen, the general consensus among the majority of WOT fans is that this is the weakest installment by far because of the repetition and lack of any plot advancement.

Is it still a fun book to read on its own merits though? Will I be able to enjoy it as an independent story regardlessall of its flaws? I've already bought every WOT book at my local Barnes and Noble except for Crossroads so I just want to make sure it's worth buying.

About potential LGBT representation, and blind casting, in the show... This comes out of discussions in another thread where a poster was worried that such changes would be disrespectful of the source material. I was initially going to put this in a reply, but wanted to put this out there to start a broader discussion:

WoT has this amazing thing going for it: per the setting, it doesn't matter whether you're gay or not. So if you change a character to be gay, or bi, it won't change them much because they won't have to have struggled with coming out, or with discrimination, or any of the things that make alternate sexuality stand out so much in our world.

It would just be an aspect of their character that no one gives two hoots about. Same as skin color. Same as eye color. These things just don't matter, in Wheel of Time.  By using that imagined world to tell stories of people who are heroic and funny and awesome, but also happen to be women/dark skinned/gay or bisexual, you change nothing of the core of the *books*, but you get to do something wonderful and rare and empowering in the context of *our* world.

You are exploring, to full potential, the tapestry that RJ wove but that he himself didn't make use of, for whatever reasons, as much as he could have. He may not have for any number of reasons. Maybe he had some ideas which fit his time, but don't fully match the attitudes of today. Maybe there were commercial considerations that held him back.

We can never know, and frankly, it doesn't matter. What *is* clear is that RJ didn't think same sex relationships, or skin color define your potential or have any relationship to what you can do, and what your story can be. And we know that not because he said it during his interviews (though he did, for some of these things), but because in hundreds of thousands of words spanning 11 books (and whatever portion of 12-14 he wrote), no character thinks of skin color or sexuality as defining traits. These things *literally* don't compute, for the characters, not even to village hicks like our heroes and heroines.

Not a one of them thinks a very dark skinned person is novel. Nor are they surprised when they encounter same sex relationships, though I don't think the boys ever do. Which means that among the rare peddlers and travelers who go through Emond's Field, there are enough people who are dark skinned, and enough people in Two Rivers have different sexuality that this is completely unworthy of comment. And, indeed, we know that in the nearby mining towns of Andor, you *do* have dark skinned people, and Rahvin claimed to be from there and no one wondered if this could be true.

Which means we have here a wonderful gift. Just like absolutely no casting director is going to loose sleep finding actors of the right height or eye color to match the characters, the writers and casting folks can play with the sexuality and skin color of the characters and *it won't matter to the story.*

So if Min is dark skinned, or Egwene, after breaking up with Rand falls for Gawyna, the dumb as a post younger sister of Elayne who was going to be First Princess of the Sword... the core story changes not at all, because *in* Randland, dark-skinned Min would have experiences and attitudes no different from light-skinned Min. A female Gawyn can be just as dumb and just as frustrating, and a bisexual Egwene wouldn't elicit comment, so what changes that matters? And before we get all a-flutter about a woman leading Andor's armies, do remember that in the Last Battle, the general of Andor's armies was Birgitte, who didn't grow a penis to be allowed to do the job.

I'm not saying these should be the things that change in this fashion. But lets not project *our* biases, which see sexuality and skin color and gender to be major characteristics of people based on which we view them differently, onto WoT. Changing these things to make the show a more inclusive version of WoT absolutely doesn't disrespect the material. It *cherishes* the best aspects of the series, and makes use of it to do something wonderful.

Showrunner for muh fantasy book-tv adaptation has mentioned FEMINISM? This will not stand (minor effort)

[The LGBT "agenda" means special treatment for gay people](https://old.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/a8iz3v/rafe_worries_me_though_id_like_to_be_anything_but/ecbdzjr/)

[Feminism means female characters can't have any negative qualities. Bonus CIS in caps as if it were an abbreviation](https://old.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/a8iz3v/rafe_worries_me_though_id_like_to_be_anything_but/ecbfydy/)

[SJWs want to jam gay people down your throat](https://old.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/a8iz3v/rafe_worries_me_though_id_like_to_be_anything_but/ecbiw0p/)

[Doesn't the fact that none of the characters make a big deal out of the non-existent gay characters mean equality is solved?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/a8iz3v/rafe_worries_me_though_id_like_to_be_anything_but/ecb4uwn/)

Context: A TV show based on Wheel of Time, a 14 book epic fantasy series, was recently greenlit by Amazon. The showrunner, Rafe Judkins, has made some mentions on twitter of changing/removing certain things from the books, including some outdated ideas about sexuality and gender.

For example, when people mention "pillow friends," they're referring to the sexist/bi-erasing trope of people (especially women) going through a gay/bi phase when younger only to grow out of it 100% of the time. Aside from a single lesbian character (who comes with her own baggage), this is the only representation of LGBT anywhere in the books, and occurs exclusively offscreen, so keep that in mind when you see people talking about how full of LGBT the series supposedly already is


These kinds of threads are posted regularly on the sub by people who surely only care about being true to the source material and definitely aren't bothered by feminism at all

*spoiler* Is there any good art, or illustrations, of the sky above Falme? I'm looking to get/make a wall hanging. As the title mentions.

I just began reading WoT again (3rd Time through) and just finished The Great Hunt.

I vividly remember in the beginning of the next book, that its mentioned a bit. I also remember they (I think it was the Whitecloaks) said that many different styles exist. All different styles and mediums, but all picture Rand and Ishamael above Falme.

I was really hoping to find one that shows Rand in "Heron waiting in the rushes" and Ishamael charging him, just before the fight ends.

Had anyone seen anything like that? Or know anyone that could accept a commission?

One Mike to Read Them All - Book II, Chapter 8 of the Two Towers, “The Stairs of Cirith Ungol” I will never understand those who say, “I'd like Tolkien's writing, but there's too much description.” That's what he's best at! It's like saying, “I'd like GGK's writing but it's too emotional” or “I'd like Sir Terry's writing but I don't like books that make me laugh and think.” Taking that away takes away what makes them great.

Morgul Vale is frightening. I love the way that Tolkien emphasizes how it *should be* beautiful, how it's *almost* beautiful, and is instead twisted and corrupt. The fields of white flowers, twisted into horrible shapes. The flowing stream, icy cold despite the steam rising from the surface. The road to the gate shining with a sickly corpse-light. Isildur's fair Tower of the Moon, that once shown with captured moonlight through the translucent marble, shining with that same corrupt light. It's nightmarish.

The eruption of Orodruin and the answering flare of light from Minas Morgul is another of those things that (when we get to RotK) serve as anchor points tying the two halves of the story together. The War of the Ring has begun in earnest.

Question for my fellow Tolkien buffs: did the Professor ever say where, exactly, the Stairs came from? Who built them and why? I'm guessing they must predate Gondor, because with the road from Minas Ithil to the high pass building those stairs seems rather a lot of work. If there’s anything about that buried in the *Histories*, I can't recall it.

(Aside: it took me a long time to realize that there's a main road from Minas Morgul to the pass, which the stairs and tunnel bypass.)

The real heart of the chapter comes at the end, and has two main parts. First there's Tolkien going meta and discussing the nature of stories, with Frodo and Sam imagining the stories that might eventually be told of the two of them. Much of this dialogue was adapted into the movies at the end of TTT, and it's a scene beloved by the fandom for good reason. It’s a very sweet moment between the two of them, and speaks to the power of storytelling in a way that the very best authors understand quite well. One passage in particular I want to draw attention to:

&gt; Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that’s a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We’ve got – you’ve got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we’re in the same tale still! It’s going on. Don’t the great tales never end?’

Several things I want to say about this passage. First, I place 100% of the blame on Tolkien, and this passage in particular, for the development of the obsessiveness that ultimately led to me being able to tell you (at least at one point) the Ajah of every random Aes Sedai and the banner of random minor houses from the Riverlands or the Reach. This passage (as well as others scattered about, including mentions of Turin and Tuor soon to come, but this more than any other) drove me absolutely *nuts*. I *needed* to know these other stories! It was a hunger that would not be satisfied until I spotted a book I’d never heard of, but with an author I knew very well, on a family member’s bookshelf. (Shout-out to Aunt Lorri for letting me borrow that copy of *The Silmarillion* all those years ago.)

Next, this passage brings to mind a quote from Neil Gaiman, said (I think) in reference to the ending of *Stardust* (the book ending, that is): “if you keep [stories] going long enough, they always end in death.” It’s true even for the Elves and the Valar.

Lastly, I love the *continuity* this gives to the story. Knowing that their story ties back into the great events of the First Age (even more directly than Sam might realize here, because Sauron himself is an important figure in *The Silmarillion*) gives it a wonderful grounding. It’s something that many of the best works of fantasy have. *A Song of Ice and Fire* ties back to the Targaryen conquest, and the Andal invasion before that, and the First Men before that, and on back to the Children of the Forest. *Harry Potter* is as much about the First Wizarding War as it is about the second. The prologue of *The Eye of the World* starts in the Age of Legends for very good reason. (Aside for those who have finished WoT: go back and reread the EotW prologue if you haven’t ever done so. Thank me later.)

Lastly: this chapter ends with the battle between Sméagol and Gollum:

&gt; And so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay Frodo’s head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam’s brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master’s breast. Peace was in both their faces.

&gt; Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched Frodo’s knee – but almost the touch was a caress. For a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.

It’s a quiet moment, and appropriately so for the climax of what I will deliberately call one of the biggest struggles in *The Lord of the Rings*. It’s the closest that Sméagol ever came to redemption, and he ultimately falls short. For Sam responds with anger and suspicion, and Sméagol/Gollum retreats - and the moment is gone. I don’t mean to say that Sam did anything *wrong* here - given that Sméagol/Gollum literally just came back from making sure everything was in order to betray them to Shelob, his suspicion is justified. But what if Frodo had been the first to awake, and responded with pity and empathy for the sad creature he understands so well? It’s impossible to say how things might have gone. Sméagol did have a genuine, if slight, chance of redemption, and Frodo’s pity brought him closer to that redemption than even Gandalf probably would have thought could happen.

I had a lot to say about this chapter, evidently. Very curious to hear what you all have to say.

Time to Read Stats - May only interest me?? So I read WoT a long time ago and gave up around Crossroads of Twilight. After Sanderson finished the series I kept meaning to get back to it and I finally did.  I've always thought that I read fast but never really tracked it before.  This time I kept notes on when i started and finished the books in the series.  I didn't track the first three individually but the rest I did.  Here are my start dates for each book and some stats on how fast I completed them.  Note, I read on my iPhone X and read periodically throughout the day and evening. Putting my kid to bed, lunch at work, on the couch while the wife watches Dynasty, that sort of thing.

Reading MoI before DG Hello, newbie here and first post to this group.

I started reading GotM while I was deployed after hearing nothing but Malazan crap from my 1SG. I love fantasy (read WoT couple years back) as well so I gave it a shot. As most will agree, I was incredibly bored and frustrated with the first 300 pages because I still felt lost in the world, no frame of reference to understand the magic, no idea of the scale of travel, etc. My 1SG kept telling me, suck it up and keep going. So I did...

After I finished GotM, I was so freaking hooked. Immediately wanting to read the next book. 1SG then said to read the third book before 2nd for a couple reasons:
1. 3rd starts on Genebackis. His argument was that I would know most of the characters upon starting book 3 and the name of the cities, etc.
2. It happens at the same time as DG so I wouldn't have to be worried about missing stuff

While I appreciate his advice, I'm now done with first 3 books and slightly saddened that I didn't read DG first. Without spoilers, there are many things that allude to events that happen in MoI that I would've liked to know in DG before reading 3.

I would absolutely agree with most of the posters here that reading them in publication order is the best way to read them. While I'm still continuing to read the series, I'm saddened that some of the main story arcs so far were brought forth on a manner that goes against the books timelines. Would you all agree with me? I mean, we've put so much time into this series I literally felt sad that I knew stuff about some of the characters already because I read 3 first.

Anyways, rant over. Thanks for reading

To Read, or to Listen? I have been lucky to do both. I have the full collection of books which I have been reading and collecting since the 1990s, and in the last few years my Husband has treated me to an Audible account, where the fist things I add to my library at one book per month is my beloved Wheel of Time.

&amp;#x200B;

For those that have done both, have you found the variance to be uplifting?, the detail to be magnifying? and the absorbance into the WOT world so incredible... or is that just me?

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the books for 2 decades, and listened to them for 2 years. There are parts and expressions I feel I have missed when reading, and when listening I have picked up on.


I am interested to hear others thoughts on how they feel between written and audio books

Finished Lord of Chaos for the first time (Spoliers LoC) I have very mixed feelings about this book. I heard that it's one of the best in the series but I honestly didn't like it that much. I feel like there are way too many sub-plots now and since Jordan needs to adress all of them, the plot itself doesn't move that much. At least that's the feeling I got from this book, now that I look back, lot of things actually happened here, yet the book feels really slow to me.

The prologue was amazing (although a bit too long, I would prefer it to be split in multiple chapters). The introduction of Demandred, some mysterious powerful myrddraal and two ressurected Forsaken? My bet is on Ishamael and Lanfear, but we'll see.

Now let's talk about the minor plotlines. Morgase is in the Fortress of Light and she was forced to make a deal with the Children. Interesting, although it could've happened quicker imo.

There are Seanchan in Tanchico? Which nobody seems to believe, cause Tanchico is in anarchy. Great opportunity for Seanchan to invade when nobody is paying attention. I love Seanchan, so I' looking forward to this.

The Forsaken are planning something. The thing that really bothers me about this book is that I still don't know who the hell is Lord of Chaos. Hopefully I'll find out soon. I like that Sammael knows he's screwed but he's manipulating everyone into thinking he's the most powerful. I feel like the Forsaken chapters must be very good on re-reads, when you actually understand their plans.

The major plotlines now, starting with Nyneave and Elayne. Oh my god the Salidar plotline was sooo boring at the beginning. There's literally a chapter where Nyneiva wanders around the village all day because she's bored. You know your plot is boring when the characters themselves complain about it. When they found out about the weather ter'angrial it was cool, but then again, it took them like 60% of the book to actually finally go look for it! And they didn't even find it yet! One thing I remember from this book for sure: Aes Sedai are a bunch of egoistic, stupid bitches. It was also cool when Nyneave healed Logain, Siuan and Leana, although I felt like it was too easy, but I didn't mind, it was awesome and I was very happy for Siuan.

Egwene had probably the best plotline in the book for me. She fell in love with Gawyn which is interesting, since Gawyn seems to have sided with the wrong Aes Sedai and he hates Rand. Then Egwene is sent to Salidar where she... becomes amyrlin! This was the biggest shock in the book for me, what in the Light? I was soo happy, because I was hoping that Egwene would actually make the Aes Sedai do something and she did! And I love that she's manipulating everyone, because she knows she'll be manipulated otherwise.

Mat is finally doing something, because in the previous book, he did almost nothing. But at the end he got his own little army and he's doing stuff with them now. Nothing particularily interesting, until he got sent to Salidar to retrieve Elayne for Rand. And yeah, I have to agree with him that our girls have turned into Aes Sedai quite a bit, cause sometimes they are egoistic bitches as well. In the end, they all end up in Ebou Dar and I'm actually looking forward to theird adventures there, cause the city seems interesting.

Perrin. For 80% of the book he was gone again and I was very disappointed, but he actually appeared again and he rocked! Faile is waay more jealous then she should be, especially since Perrin is doing everything he can to avoid other women (Berelain). He got along with Faile's parents though, which is good.

And Rand of course! He did sooo many things in this book, but they felt like they don't make much impact, until the end of the book. First of, we got Taim and the asha'man, which I really liked. Also, I feel like Taim has to be one of the Forsaken, because Luis Therin acts way too weird around him. Speaking of Luis Therin, I like how he managed to cooperate with Rand in the end, although again, it took a bit too long imo. Then we got some stuff with the Caemlyn and Cairhien highborns, one trio to Shadar Logot, which was cool. Some stupid things about one Maiden who became a servant to fulfill her toh (honestly this was so stupid and I hated everytime this was adressed, should've been cut out completely). His plan about luring Sammael to think Rand is going to attack from the east (although this plan still isn't finished which is again, disappointing). And meeting with the two Aes Sedai groups, who are both bitches. Although the Salidar group was tricked into thinking Rand attacked them.  And we now know a lot more about Rand's mother, which was really cool!

The ending - Dumai Wells. Now the battle itself was written perfectly, I loved reading it and it was an epic conclusion to the book. But I have one big issue with this battle: I was expecting a plot twist. This is a problem I has for the last two or three books, there is always a battle or a fight at the end of the book and the good guys always win. This time, I was told that this ending is the craziest shit ever, so I really thought something would go wrong, perhaps Taim would betray Rand, or Rand would go mad or get overwhelmed by Luis Therin. But Rand got simply saved and all is good again. Aes Sedai finally knelt before Rand though, so at least there's that. Now don't get me wrong, the battle itself was amazing, I was just expecting a bit different outcome.

Overall, I am rating this book on the third place in my personal leaderboard, behind TSR and FoH. I was actually thinking about putting it on the fourth place, behind TGH, but this book was way more complex that TGH, so I decided to put it in third. I think my main issue with this book is, I was way too hyped about it, and it didn't meet my expectations at all, since they were too high. I partly blame this subreddit, because a lot of people rate this book as the best in the series. And perhaps it is in the long run, maybe once I understand how masterfully everything was set up here, or I'll understand or the plans that are going on in the background, I will love this book. But for now, it was mediocre for me.

Now I heard somewhere I should read "Strike at Shayol Ghul" after this book, is that true? And is there anything else WoT related I should read besides the main books?

Wheel of Time on Kindle price? Okay, my husband is a HUGE WoT fan, has first edition hardcovers of all the books (buying him the missing ones were easy and fun gifts while we were dating!), and has been urging me to try them for years, as they were a huge part of his growing up years. I did read Eye of the World a couple years ago but never made it much further.

ANYways, I just got a new Kindle Paperwhite, and am toying with buying the Kindle versions, as I believe it will make it more likely for me to read the series that way. My question is - they are currently sitting at $9.99 a piece. Does anyone know if that is likely to change (i.e., should I hold out for a price reduction or sale at some point), or should I just bite the bullet?

Thanks!

What are some great WoT-focused Youtube Channels to watch? So I recently came across a pretty awesome Youtuber called [Daniel Greene](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw--xPGVVxYzRsWyV1nFqgg) who has a lot of great videos focused on The Wheel of Time (Lore discussions, TV Show Discussions, Character Discussions, Book Reviews, etc.) and it's left me hungry for more such channels I can binge watch that have a lot of WoT content, whether it be book reviews, lore &amp; character discussions, buzz about the upcoming TV series, or really anything. It doesn't have to be the entire focus of the channel but would like a relatively still active (the youtuber still makes new videos) channel with a lot of great WoT content.

So please send me any suggestions you can think of, but also don't just throw out random links, give a little context on what makes them worth watching :)

Finally WoT after 2 years -- what a goddamn ride. [Spoilers All] I know I'm retreading ground that all of you have walked across, but I have so many thoughts and things to say

1. Mat is the single most complete character I've ever read. Towards the end, there were so many attributes and possessions of his that *each* had deep backstory for. It felt almost like the series started with images of heroes and then worked backwards to explain each part. His staff, hat, scar, medallion, the way he treated others, his band, the lace. Other characters sometimes had sorta McGuffin things (Egwene and the wand, Rand and the heron sword just given to him) but Mat *earned* all his trinkets.

2. The last 3 books were super satisfying, but towards the end I think I began to really appreciate Jordan's writing. It was fucking *infuriating* for books 7-10, but I appreciated that there was almost nothing 'told', rather everything was shown, slowly, deliberately.

3. I almost feel Jordan's writing was meant to make you feel what the characters were feeling through *how* everything was written -- in the sense that when I felt frustrated with him repeating something forty times, the characters in the book also felt frustrated. Being annoyed with his constant use of gendered stereotypes and \*tugs at braid\*s was a means of making us feel the annoyance the book felt (although it was annoyance *at* the book for us). This may be giving him too much credit, but I feel he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

4. I was a little disappointed in how the final battle between Rand and Shai'tan went, was weirdly straightforward. I had been hoping/predicting that the end would be more of Rand being an incarnation of Shai'tan, and that them + Lews were each part of a cycle of the Dragon breaking then saving the world. Like, Shai'tan was evil, Lews was neutral (good with deep faults), Rand was good (having 'conquered' the darkness), and that it would have shown the wheel circling around.

5. Felt like the epilogue was really the last chapter, and that we didn't get an actual epilogue. Feel like the series deserved a 'A wind blew down across the western oceans...' that showed the beginning of the 4th age: a statue in Tar Valon of Egwene, Perrin and Faile chatting in a castle blacksmithy of his seat in Two Rivers, the two children of Rand visiting their half-sibilings in Rhuidan, etc.

6. I am very, very happy I finished the series, books 7-10 were among the worst I have ever read for how frustrated they made me, but getting through them made the rest of it feel that much better.

7. I want to read Malazan now but hoooo-boy I don't think I'm ready for another 2 years of deep fantasy. Maybe I'll pulp through some Discworlds or something.

8. Moiraine and Nynaeve felt underutilized in the final fight. All the other characters got sweeping endings, but those two felt like they didnt get proper service. Sure, Nynaeve saved the day with her herbs, but that was such a minor bit. And what was Moiraine's purpose there? She could have been subbed with any other Aes Sedai and it wouldn't have made a difference.

-----------------------

Anyway, thanks for reading my tangled thoughts. Felt I needed to get them out and I only know one person who has finished these and I think he's probably annoyed with all my chatter about it by now.

End of the Series Little Background: Within the last few years I started reading. I’ve never been much of a reader but I found myself in a spot that I needed to do something besides play games or watch videos on my phone. So I started reading the LOTR, I liked the movies so why not? Loved it. Moved on to the Game Of Thrones books. And eventually Wheel Of Time. All the other series I’ve read have either been finished (Malazan) or no end in sight (Stormlight/Locke/GOT/KingKiller)

What is it like to finish a series when that last book comes out? Eye of the World came out in 1990, A Memory Of Light in 2013. What’s it like to hold that last book in a series you’ve spent years reading, knowing it’s the end of a journey (insert there are no endings)? It took me 4 months to finish WOT, by the time I got to AMOL I was just consumed by finding out what happened I never stopped to consider that it was the end. So what’s it like?

Dune's influence on other fantasy series (other than Star Wars) I'm just now getting around to digging into Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series (it's only taken way too long), and beyond the clear J.R.R. Tolkien liftings, the amount of Dune references/inferences central to the plot is entertaining.

I understand the WoT series is supposed to be an amalgam of all sorts of legends and people of legend whose stores are repeated under different names over and over, but for how heavily Dune and Middle Earth are used, it's pretty obvious Jordan was enamored with Tolkien and Herbert.

What other fantasy works can you name that are as influenced by Herbert?

{Spoilers WH} WH✔️ High highs, low lows That last chapter, wow. Just wow. Definitely my favorite (with only the ending of LoC beating it). It took me a bit to understand how the taint was being cleansed, but I understand it now. I really enjoyed how various POVs were being used throughout the chapter, including the Forsaken. The Forsaken being humbled by other channelers, especially Cyndane and Alivia, was entertaining. Plus, I love how we saw the different motivations of the Forsaken trying to kill Rand (especially Cyndane; she’s my favorite and I’m glad Lanfear is back). 


Overall, I liked the book, but the first half was a slog. Once we got to a lot of Rand and Mat chapters, it got exponentially better. 


Things I liked:


Far Madding= I love how ubiquitous the Power is in society in WoT, but I think having a city that bars the Power (generally) from use adds a lot to the world. It brings everyone to equal footing and humbles channelers who enter the city. It also showed how important Rand’s command to Taim was about teaching those in the Black Tower about physical defense for those times when the Power fails you. The rogue Asha’man didn’t take that training seriously (or Taim didn’t) and couldn’t handle Rand (or Fain, although to be fair, he did ambush one of them, and he probably ambushed the other two). Not to mention, Aes Sedai are woefully helpless without the help of their Warders in such a situation. That said, it was totally badass when Cadsuane intimidated the Counsel with the Well. 


Rand= Even though the goal of Cadsuane and Sorilea is to humanize him, I think it’s super badass how cold he has become (as cold as winter’s heart, one may say), such as when Min becomes unsettled when she discovers that he does not have a reaction when he killed the rogue Asha’man. 


Nynaeve= She keeps growing as a character and I’m now beginning to like her, instead of dislike her as in earlier in the series. She’s one of the only Aes Sedai who Rand trusts, so much so that he trusts her to link with her (inevitably giving her control initially). I also like how the Aes Sedai experience both what saidin is like and what the taint is like (as well as Rand seeing what saidar is like).


Mat= HE APPEARED IN THIS BOOK!! I don’t like reading books without him (or Rand). I’m glad he finally met the Daughter of the Nine Moons and is escaping Ebou Dar, but I wish he hadn’t announced that she will be his wife. It makes the relationship that will develop between them less natural. Although, I am interested to see how he brings Tuon around to ally with Rand. What happens with the male a’dam though… that presents difficulties. 


Rand + Lan= I always enjoyed their dynamic. There is mutual respect and Lan is almost a mentor-like figure who looks out for Rand (he did so even with Moiraine, to Moiraine’s annoyance). I also chuckle anytime Lan (and Min) call Rand “sheepherder.” It both reminds Rand of where he’s come from, puts him on equal footing with everyone else, and is hilarious. 


Things I disliked:


Egwene and Elayne= Don’t need to go too much into this, but I hate these two characters and they’re only getting worse. Elayne seemed to be growing after being with Mat in Ebou Dar, but she’s getting worse again. They’re arrogant pricks. Speaking of Egwene, I hope this battle for Tar Valon happens soon. I’d like it if Egwene asked for Rand’s help (and the Black Tower’s) as linking together would both make Elaida stand no chance and it would also bring the Black and White Tower together as one, with both male and female Aes Sedai as in the past Ages, especially with the taint cleansed (on a side note, I wonder how much that will affect society and how long it will take people to believe them and for male channelers to not be stigmatized). 


Bonding= I think Jordan botched Rand’s love story and I think this was the culmination of it. IMO, it would’ve been better if Elayne were Rand’s first kiss and hookup buddy, then he progressed to Aviendha, and then he realized Min was the one (she’s really the only one who clicks best with him anyway). But all three? C'mon. Also, after having been rape-Bonded by Alanna, I was expecting Rand to be so averse to Bonding that he would’ve never wanted it and would have angrily reacted. Him conceding to it did not seem realistic, especially in such a short time frame. That was such a traumatic experience. Also, now 4 prominent people are Bonded to him, meaning he has 4 different weaknesses that he has to protect now for his own sanity. If any of them are harmed, as the Dragon Reborn, the world is in big trouble. I think it was selfish of both Rand and the girls to do it. I get that Rand needs some happiness in his life, but this was not the way to do it, in my opinion. 


Elayne + Aviendha= Don’t get me wrong, I thought the scene of them becoming sisters was great. It was an interesting read. However, I just don’t like how Elayne suddenly becomes Aiel while only having experience with one Aielwoman. Egwene becoming de facto Aiel (as well as Rand) makes sense because she studies with Wise Ones for an extended period of time. But Elayne? Nope. Yes, she became Aviendha’s sister first and foremost, and then through that association, she kinda becomes Aiel. But she barely understands Aiel culture and hasn’t even been to the Threefold-Land! Elayne also hasn’t had much time with Aviendha to suddenly want to become her sister! It reminds me of her wanting to be Aiel because it seems “cool,” kinda like with her wanting to learn curse words and awkwardly incorporate them into her lexicon (annoyingly so). It doesn’t sit well with me and seems unrealistic. It would’ve made much more sense if Egwene had become her sister (although that would never happen with Rand in the picture). WoT would be much better, IMO, if Aviendha's and Elayne’s roles were minimized or cleaned up. All of what I said may be wrong if Elayne has had more experience with Aiel, so correct me if I’m wrong on that. 


Cadsuane= Moiraine but with an inflated ego. I get that she needs to squash Rand’s ego, but she herself needs to be put in her place as well. Rand learned best from people who cared about him (Moiraine, Min, etc.), not people who slapped him anytime he used any foul language or issued an order. She should be assertive, yet understanding and kind, not an entitled asshole. Hopefully, she gets better, but I doubt it. Although, I am glad she truly cares about Rand, like in saving him from Far Madding. 


Perrin= I’m tired of his plot. I like how we see how devastating it is for him to lose Faile, but the plot is stagnating, his character growth is nonexistent, and it’s taking too long. This made the beginning of the book very boring. 


Asha’man Warders= Unless if I missed it, Jordan casually mentioned how they became Warders and it wasn’t clarified until Rand asked Cadsuane (and then he was slapped, I believe). I wish it were more explicitly mentioned earlier because that is a big deal. 



Questions:


Why did the female access key to the Choedan Khal get destroyed but not the male one?

Callandor was mentioned as being dangerous both because it magnifies the taint and because it is “unstable” (or something along those lines). What does it being “unstable” mean?

The Choedan Khal had never been used before in past Ages, right? Both Lews Therin and the Forsaken seemed terrified of it.

Before the last chapter of WH, was there any other indication that Elza was of the Black Ajah? Also, why does she believe that Rand must make it to the Last Battle if she’s a Darkfriend?

Just finfished The Eye of The World I've been reading this book since last 2 months and today finally finished it. I feel so accomplished!

I can't believe I never tried to get into WoT before. I was missing out on so much. I personally think this book was better than Tolkien in many ways.

Next up, The Great Hunt.

[spoilers] It was an end. It is done. I finished a series i did not know of a year ago.

What an awesome story. I only rarely cried with other books but mostly it was with the loss of a character or something sad happening. But now I cried because the story is done. What an amazing ride it has been.

And finally I can read whatever spoiler post on this forum without fear !

As a child you don't realize that you can't unread a book. As an adult you do realize this and it saddens me. Now WoT will be a journey I know and gladly will do it again !

My year long journey through Cosmere nearing an end Last February I started Mistborn; it was my first Sanderson book other than his work in the WOT series. Like many, I was quickly hooked. By summer I was into Stormlight and fall was Mistborn series 2. I started Oathbringer a few days after Christmas.

It’s been a great year diving into the Cosmere!

A few observations:

*I’m nearly 40, so I’ll probably be in my sixties when the Cosmere is finished. I hope I live that long!

*I’ve enjoyed recommending Mistborn Final Empire to many people; it seems the best starting point for the universe.

*That said, some of the short stories, as well as Elantris and Warbreaker, were simply delightful. Mistborn series 2 is great in showing Sanderson’s range as a writer and giving us something a bit different.

*after Oathbringer I suppose I’ll have to try non-Cosmere Sanderson stuff.

*I’m glad I can peruse reddit and not have to worry about spoilers anymore. :)

Books similar to Anne Bishops Black Jewels Trilogy? I’m kinda sorta new to the fantasy genre.

I read Anne Bishops Black Jewels Trilogy when I was a teenager (27 now!) and the trilogy + the short stories have been my go to read ever since.

Currently just started on The Wheel of Time but my signed copy of the BJ Trilogy tempts me every single time I walk by my bookshelf.

I would love to go further into the fantasy genre and while I’m enjoying WOT I really want to read more similar books/series to the Black Jewels series!

Thank you 😊

A friend pointed out that spren don't seem to betray emotion.. Has that been discussed here? A friend of mine started his journey through the Cosmere recently by blasting through Way of Kings and Words of Radiance in less than two weeks. He'd just come off a Robert Jordan 'high' when he finished he Wheel of Time. He enjoyed how Sanderson capped off WoT and was cautiously optimistic before starting Stormlight.

&amp;#x200B;

One of his main criticisms of Shallan's character, was that she never seemed to have to deal with any consequences of her actions and always seemed to come out on top; mostly due to her flexing her fledgling confidence in WoK and maturing as a person. I feel somewhat the same, although in the back of my mind, I think I've been waiting for Shallan's character to eventually have a significant failure/fall from grace (although that hasn't come yet). I'm usually god at reserving judgement until I've experienced the whole work. :)

&amp;#x200B;

With that long drawn out explanation being said.. it got him wondering why we see Brandon using spren often to show emotion but when a character like Shallan is typically using her illusions to lie or cover up certain things... Why do the spren never seem to betray a characters true emotions?

[Spoilers] Question: The Gathering Storm, Sanderson/Jordan Blend I'm just starting my first read of TGS. I feel bittersweet gratitude getting to read more WoT, but knowing that KoD was the last fully-Jordan writing.

I'm enjoying the book so far, but it's hard not to feel nervous. I've read that RJ finished sections of the last three books, and I'm concerned that soon I'm going to hit a sudden dropoff -- where the style suddenly becomes all Sanderson, [or adapted Sanderson, as he mentions,](https://books.google.com/books?id=k88UDDDvrS0C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22Imagine+this+book+as+the+product+of+a+new+director%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XP3Dh542_Y&amp;sig=wuOwE-u7qfypTTs7_NktWBTSxqI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr4tiY8tTfAhXHiVQKHdVADVIQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Imagine%20this%20book%20as%20the%20product%20of%20a%20new%20director%22&amp;f=false) -- and maybe I'll enjoy it, or tolerate it, or completely hate it.

&amp;nbsp;

It feels silly to be worrying about this ("Come on, man, just read and find out whether or not you like it"). But, I figure if I was still in school, talking every day with the friends who introduced me to the series thirteen years ago, I'd be discussing this with them, so I want to ask you about it as my WoT-loving community.

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe I'm priming myself to look for differences and getting worried over nothing, but my heart is so attached to Jordan's bustling, sweeping, affectionate, intricate, patient style, and I don't know if it's worth it to me to force myself through hundreds of pages of potentially dissonant-feeling passages just to get plot resolution. **I just don't have a sense of how dissonant it's going to get.** I was pretty certain I would notice a difference, but maybe I've read fully Sanderson bits already without knowing it, and he's doing a fine job making the voice feel continuous. It's not that I think Sanderson wouldn't write well, but what makes WoT, WoT for me is so much about how it's told.

&amp;nbsp;

**In short, I want to know:**

Can you as a reader feel stark borderlines where the voice is Sanderson vs. Jordan? If so, how has this affected your experience of the last three books? If not, what do you think about Sanderson's adapted style (not his acceleration of the plot, but *how* he tells the story) and how it contributes to making the books still feel like The Wheel of Time?

&amp;nbsp;

*When you ask questions, then you have to hear the answers whether you want to or not*

New year, new me request for help. So with the first month of the year I'm back at the gym. I like audiobooks for this, and in the past I've gone thru the Dresden files, the Sanderson catalogue, WOT and Brent Weeks.

I'm looking for similar "easy reads", ideally energetic ones, and hopefully something that has a good series.

I've done name of the wind, Terry Pratchett's and the Troy series but they don't work because they either need too much focus, or not enough. So I'd anyone has a good series to recommend I'd appreciate it.

Thanks

Moiraine in the televised series It’s very rare for me to think of an actor or actress and say “Yes they’d be perfect for that role” or “What were you thinking??”, when it happens it feels so obvious, hear me out.

I’ve been rewatching Babylon 5 and happened to start re-listening to the WoT audiobooks at the same time. I was suddenly struck by how perfect Mira Furlan (Delenn) would be.

While the characters Delenn and Moiraine are very different they also share a lot of commonality. Right now I can’t even imagine anyone else in the role.

If you’ve seen Babylon 5 through to the end of season 2, 3 or 4 let me know what you think. Am I way off base?

Read the WoT too many times and need a new outlet? First off- who in the world can read too much of WoT?? That's crazy person talk right there!

More to the point though I just wanted to pop in and add that there is an actual Wheel of Time "video" game as it were.

If you like pen and paper table top games the Wheel of Time MUD might be worth checking out! I am doing a live stream on twitch.tv/wotmudu from 9am EST until about 5pm. I will be answering questions about the game and just some general fun chat about the series in general.

If you would rather just jump right into the game you can find it at writtenrealms.com/wot Just pick a name you might find in Rand-land and you're good to go.

Thanks for reading and walk in the Light...or Dark i guess if youre into that.

Looking For Good "Farmboy Fantasy" I love love love the classic "farmboy has to go on a quest to save the world" trope, and I want to read more of those. Bonus Points if there's a Dark One of some kind, the protagonist is a Chosen One, they have friends with them on their quest (either from the beginning or met along the way), and Super Bonus Points if the "farmboy" is a "farmgirl".

Some similar series I've read and enjoyed:

Wheel of Time - While I haven't enjoyed all of Wheel of Time, I loved The Eye of The World

The Shadow of What Was Lost - Part of a series called the Licanius Trilogy I think? I haven't read the second one yet

The Dragonbone Chair - Currently reading it and LOVING it, it has everything I like, evil dark lord, magic swords, a kindly wizard...

Recluce Saga - mostly the first book, though I also loved the second. Haven't read the rest.

Honorable Mentions (series I love, but don't fit the trope):

All Sanderson books. He's my favorite author and I love all of his books so much.

Gardens of The Moon - Haven't read Deadhouse Gates (yet &gt;:3 I got it for christmas) but I loved Gardens of The Moon, I loved the Gods and all the characters, and even though I'm a lesbian, dare I say,,,Anomander Rake is Sexy™ (seriously though the Tiste Andii awakened my love for Dark Elves)

Legacies, by L.E. Modesitt Jr.

Bonus Points also if the book is older (80s or 90s, maybe 70s?), has some good, but not necessarily beautiful cover art (think WoT covers, or Recluce), was published by Tor (I really like the Tor symbol ok...), and comes in mass market paperback form. You know the type of books I'm talking about. Like the kind they have at half-price books by the hundreds. I love those

Sorry about the...weirdness of this post, it's 4 a.m. where I live right now and I am. so tired

Book Recommendations: Futuristic slums style Hey, I’m in between series at the moment and I’m fancying something slightly different to my normal reads and would really appreciate some recommendations for me to try out.

I’m fancying something with a similar setting to Sanderson’s Reckoner series, with futuristic settings/technology but down trodden uprising style storyline....

FYI - normal reads includes WoT, WoK etc

Thanks!

Ken Scholes: Psalms of Isaak is the closest thing I have found to the Wheel of Time He is not a well known author so few people will know who he is. His 5 book series is complete. By close to RJ, I do not mean he copies his formula. The story is very different. However, his rich prose and post apocalyptic fantasy reminds of me of Robert Jordan. This is minus the long winded recurring motiffs and the BDSM.

Its basically Sci-Fantasy. The story starts out with a Robot named Isaak getting reprogrammed to cast a spell that nukes a city. The city is a fantasy version of the Roman Catholic Church. In this universe the Church are archeologists that dig up ancient magically items and hide them to protect them from the world. These items were used in something that reminds me of the Breaking of the World, but its not a copy of it. The magic system and story are totally different.

The first book is an action mystery to try to figure out who reprogrammed the robot and why. It also treats Isaak like a person and he has to deal with the emotional trauma of nuking a city. Its not as big of a story as Wheel of Time. Its only 5 books and much shorter, but there is a deep rich history. For example later on in the book we learn about how the moon had been colonized and there was an era of the Laughning Czars. Reminds me someone of the back story of the age of legends.

Its really good and he should get more publicity. The series is also complete. His blog is no longer active, but he is pretty active on Facebook.

http://www.kenscholes.com/

I think WoT fans will like his book. The books are relatively short so its not a big committment to try it out.

Newbie to the series, need help with gift idea Hi! So my partner’s birthday is coming up and he’s a HUGE fan of WoT. He’s also a very big Lego fan.
I’ve only just started reading the first book that he lent to me and I was thinking of making a fake Lego set of a building from the series as a present.
I don’t know enough about it to know what place/building would be good to choose though.

Any ideas?

[Oathbringer] What theories did you buy into before that have come true? And what similar theories do you believe strongly in going forward? Re-reading a series like WoT made me wish I could've kept up with the discussions on what people were theorizing would happen in future books.

I enjoyed doing this in ASOIAF, Harry Potter (Mugglenet RIP), and other series.

What theories did you believe/have read that have come true prior to Oathbringer? Heck did you have any theories going into WoR that did come true?

And also what theories do you also believe in strongly going forward?

For me:

Pre-OB:

1. Humans aren't native to Roshar. The clues those theories pointed out at the time were how "unsuitable" humans were on the planet compared to everything else.

2. Tezim is Ishar. I remember when I first read that Mraize mentioned "that creature in Tukar", I had to check out 17th shard to see if others had any thoughts.

3. Jezrien was the beggar that Szeth saw in the 1st book.


Future theories I have read and liked:

1. Cusicesh the Protector is one of the Unmade. The theory is detailed here (courtesy of /u/Topsyt): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/5udthb/wor_elaborate_theory_weve_already_seen_an_unmade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/5udthb/wor_elaborate_theory_weve_already_seen_an_unmade/)

2. The Dawnshards are on Aimia. I've seen this theory before and I remember I made a thread about it way back. If ya'll want to read about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/7hn4it/oathbringer_the_secret_of_aimia_the_dawnshards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/7hn4it/oathbringer_the_secret_of_aimia_the_dawnshards/)



Also does anyone have any theories on Rall Elorim? It's referred to as the City of Shadows and seems so mysterious in general.

Finally finished (No spoilers) After reading the books intermittently in my teens/early 20s and dropping out after LoC (for context, this was about a dozen years ago), I picked up the series again, from EotW, in late-February of last year. I finished AMoL yesterday morning. What a ride. I guess I owe a big thanks to RJ and BS. I had an amazing time over the past 10+ months.

I have a huge stack of unread books burning a hole in my shelf, probably half of which are fantasy. But I will have to take a break from the genre for a bit, because I don't know what could live up to WoT, at least with the memory of the series so fresh.

Should i start all over again? I discovered The Wheel of Time and started reading the Eye of the World on august 2017. I bought all the books and read until halfway Lord of Chaos, then i decided to take a break with the series because i wanted to start reading other things. That was a year ago (january 2018) and then i bought and read all of Sanderson's books, the First Law trilogy, Assassins Apprentice and some other books.

Then i decided to start reading WoT again because i really like it. The problem is that i left in the middle of Lord of Chaos, and now i dont remember a lot of details (Aes Sedai names, Forsaken plots, etc).

Is there a resource (page, video, etc) where i can read the summerized version of the first 5 books or something like that to get me updated? Or should i start over again and read all the books (probably going to take me almost all the year)?

I also want to read Malazan and maybe finish the Farseer Trilogy in between, but i suppose im going to lose the tiny WoT details again if i do that.

Reminiscing: The Way of the Leaf (Spoilers - warning - continue only if you have finished the series at least once) I've read the series once and I am just beyond halfway through the audiobooks. I love and am in love with the series.


One thing that always got me emotional throughout WoT is the Tuatha'an, the Way of the Leaf, and the Aeil history. All the scenes, all the history, the descendants of the Way of the Leaf and how the Tuatha'an echo the Aeil. Aeil value blacksmiths highly, Tuatha'an have always been seen as a people who could fix anything; Tuatha'an disgust towards weapons, Aeil disgust towards swords; both of their incredible respect towards Aes Sedai as if they still had the ancient reverence that modern Randland does not have for them; Tuatha'an finding The Song (I have a feeling that this echoes the time the Tuatha'an people of the Leaf sang and delayed one of the crazy male channelers that sat and destroyed all of them with a confused look on his face as they sang songs of peace to him), Aeil waking from the dream (effectively something linking to Tel'aran'rhiod). I remember Moiraine commanding the loyalty of some Tuatha'an women in book 2. The Aeil revere their wise ones as they would Aes Sedai as well.


The fall of Rhuidean, the Breaking, the scattering of pre-Aeil Tuatha'an, the scattering of Ogier and the wondering and longing. The Breaking of Tuatha'an... it just gets to me every time. All the scenes involving the Ter'Angreal in Rhuidean that recorded the histories really get to me. It just makes me sad to see the fall. Anyway, bye!

Should I read Janny Wurts? I've read most of the popular fantasy like Abercrombie, Rothfuss, Lynch, etc. and I'm trying to decide whether or not to read the work of Janny Wurts. I've heard that her prose is difficult because of the vocabulary, but as an English Lit major, I'm not too worried about that.

Is her storytelling compelling? Does it move faster than Robin Hobb's plots (which I love, but I'm looking for something faster paced now)? Is it Malazan-esque in its span?

For the record, I am not a big fan of GRRM, Terry Goodkind, or WoT. I do, however, worship at the temple of Malazan and, to an extent, Realms of the Elderlings. I'm looking for something fun and magical with a serious overtone, but I'm scared to commit to Wurts because once I start, I will feel compelled to finish.

New listener with a few questions * Hey /r/thelegendarium , I just started listening to the podcast to suppliment my first time read through of WoT (Currently on Book 6 Lord of Chaos) and really enjoyed their overall discussion. I am currently listening to the recap episode where they go through books 1-5 and the first few chaprters of 6 and they started to have some discussion on things to come in the series.


&amp;nbsp;


While I know a couple of them are on their first read through and others have read it, do they manage to stay spoiler free through the podcast? I am double checking now before I ruin it for myself.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I am excited to go back and listen to their discussion on books I've already read like LOTR and Sanderson's Cosmere. Do they have any specific episodes that you recommend first time listener catch up on?

2018 Reading Summary I had a great, fantastical reading year in 2018 and I thought I'd give a quick rundown of the books I read (trust me, this won't take long):

**A Deepness in the Sky - Vernor Vinge**
Not strictly fantasy, but a great, exciting, imaginative sci-fi novel. I enjoyed it even more than Vinge's other, related, high-profile book *A Fire Upon the Deep*. I technically started this one in late-2017, but read most of it in January 2018, so I'm counting it.

**Sourdough - Robin Sloan**
This was an unexpected find. I tend to be very particular about the books I read and find that when people try to assume what I will like and gift me a book, it usually isn't something I'd really enjoy. But this one was a weird sweet-spot gift that merged my love of speculative fiction with my love of bread-making. It's a quick, fun read about a magical sourdough starter that also satirizes tech/start-up culture.

**The Devourers - Indra Das**
I had read a bit about this book when it first came out, but only happened on a copy at a steep discount and it took a little while to make it to the top of my to-read pile. And I regretted sitting on it for so long. I found the book thematically dense, in a really good way. It left a lot to think about and I reread several sections to really absorb the ideas. Quite unlike anything I've read. It really hit me hard and I still think about it every once in a while, 11 months after finishing it.

**A Wrinkle in Time - Madeleine L'Engle**
A classic that I missed in my childhood. I read it before the film came out and can see why it's still highly regarded all these decades later. (I saw the film too; enjoyable, but in a different way than the book.)

**The Wheel of Time - Robert Jordan (&amp; Brandon Sanderson)**
This was my Big Fantasy Thing last year. I finally decided to plunge into WoT. I had happened upon it by chance in high school and read through the first six books over six or seven years, amongst all my other reading, and then lost interest. In late-February 2018 I cracked open The Eye of the World again and read straight through (with one brief break; see below) to the end, including the prequel novel. I started off 2019 by reading the last 450 pages of Book 14. It felt like a suitably epic accomplishment and I loved the experience.

**Other books**
I only read one non-speculative fiction book last year. I don't want to venture off the sub's topic, but if you're really curious about it, let me know and I'll summarize.

I hope everyone had a great 2018, and here's to a happy, fun, magical 2019!

For those who have read WoT... are you concerned about possibility of another Padan Fain scenario? Fain had 13 books of build-up and was disposed of in the most anticlimactic way possible. How you think, what character is the most likely candidate for that treatment? I am very afraid that Taravangian and/or Nale might meet a disappointing end in a few books, but I really hope that Brandon will not repeat that blunder.

WOT merchandise I often go searching for apparel or merchandise of the Wheel of Time. Although Taveren Tees and Dragonmount have some nice stuff, it still feels like there's so much more potential for graphic tees or hoodies for the series. Does anyone know where else one could find WOT merch?

Recommendations after reading most of the big ones. Hey everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some recommendations on where to go next. I have lurked for a long time and have somewhat of a "to be read" list but I'm not super pumped about a lot of the books on there. This sub is one of my favorites and I have read a number of books just learning about them from this sub, so thanks for those! I mainly am an audiobook "reader" so bonuses for fantastic narrators.

&amp;#x200B;

Books/Series I have already read :

* WOT
* ASOIAF
* Malazan
* Cosmere
* Night Angel
* Lightbringer
* First Law world (and Shattered Sea)
* The Prince of Nothing
* The Aspect-Emperor
* Kingkiller 1+2

My fantasy preferences are pretty standard. I don't usually have a problem with the classic tropes depending on how they are handled. I do really enjoy a strong and well explained magic system. I have also really enjoyed a strong physical fighting component in conjunction with magic as in WOT, Cosmere, and Lightbringer. As evidenced by my love of Malazan and WOT I have absolutely no problems with long series.

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely grateful for any and all replies, I appreciate you guys taking the time to help me (and hopefully others!) find their next fantasy journey.

Questions about how exactly WoT is a wheel of time I'm only on book six but I'm still confused as to how exactly WoT is a *wheel of time*.

Sanderson shout out to Stormlight Archive in The Gathering Storm I have been relistening to the series, and as a huge Brandon Sanderson fan, I had to pause and appreciate an off-handed comment from Aviendha in The Gathering Storm that was to me a huge shout out to the second ideal of the Windrunners.

"There was ji in caring for those who could not care for themselves."

It is pretty clear to me that this was intentional by /u/mistborn and I hope there are more before the end! It sure was a fun nugget to stumble on.

Anybody notice any other Stormlight nuggets in the Sanderson WoT books?

Just finished Winter's Heart - summing up some of my thoughts so far! (Spoilers through WH) I've been plugging away through WoT for a while now, but now that I'm just about 2/3 of the way through, I really wanted to get some of my thoughts down. I keep spoiling myself accidentally by compulsively looking at the Tor reread, so I'm trying to stay away from the super spoilery parts of the internet. Overall, I REALLY enjoyed Winter's Heart - it's definitely one of my favorites so far.

1. The Rand storyline and the end scene with cleansing saidin was fantastic. I absolutely loved the way it was written and the cast of characters involved, and generally really liked this arc for Rand. I loved that Nynaeve was the one he chose to do this with - she's easily in my top 5 characters and has been getting the short end of the stick for a while (in like one book we got healers that are better than her, channelers that are more powerful, and someone else healing stilling) so it was cool for her to get this moment. Also, I know that a lot of people really hate Cadsuane, but I actually... really like her as a character? She's interesting, organized, competent, and my favorite thing, generally CALM. I felt similarly positive about Moiraine. WoT does suffer from WAY too many characters who have "has a huge temper" as a personality trait. I know I just said that Nynaeve is my fav, but aside from her, I wish people would just calm down a bit.
2. That leads into Rand's three romances. Aviendha has been criminally underutilized, I think - I love her and she has gotten barely any PoVs, and has also spent the last book basically sitting on the floor in Elayne's room doing nothing. I really hope she gets her own plot thread soon. Elayne is... meh. I really feel super meh about her. I don't hate her but I don't like her. Her Andor storyline is meh. Min, I actually really disliked at first, but I get the sense that I'm supposed to like her, so I'm trying to change my opinion. She just seemed super miscellaneous and misplaced to me at first, and I also feel like she's meant to be the "chill" one of the three, however she goes around throwing knives and threatening to whip Rand any time she disagrees with him which is.... not chill at all?
3. Another less popular opinion seems to be that I have REALLY been enjoying all the Aes Sedai politicking and drama that has been happening, both in the Egwene and tower chapters. I've had to start keeping handwritten notes about all the names, Ajahs, etcs, to stay on top of it, but I am super excited for the siege and the clash between the two groups and how this is all going to play out.
4. Mat's plotline in WH was really fantastic. I think he's shown a ton of growth as a character while still staying interesting and true to himself. His "relationship" with Tylin still makes me highly uncomfortable, so I'm glad that piece of it is at an end. But, his handling of the last scene where he frees the Windfinder damane so she can free everyone else, and then Tuon catches him escaping and he just fully leans in to the Daughter of the Nine Moons prediction - all really good. He manages to balance out "being the hero" while still having a reasonable backup plan and not putting everyone in danger for no reason. Which brings me to....
5. Perrin. Oh my god. I cannot summon even one iota of interest in the Shaido, the Faile rescue attempt, or Masema (especially not Masema). This section was painful for me to read and made me nervous that I was going to hate WH since there was so much in the early chunk of it. Perrin's whole emo "I sense everyone's emotions but still don't have a clue" and "Let's drop everything and make thousands of people follow me to rescue my wife" thing is just not working for me. Berelain? What is this woman's problem? Like, is she a Darkfriend? What gives? At this point, I didn't even mind reading Faile's individual chapters, but Perrin's were unreadable.

I suspect/know that CoT is going to bring me a lot more Perrin, unfortunately, but I'm hoping we get some traction on the Aes Sedai clash as well and get some spotlight moments for some of the characters who haven't has as much time to shine.

Is Malazan worth the time? Okay I am not a stranger to long running/long book series. I tend to like them (WoT, Discworld,ect) but my question is going into a 21 book series is it good enough to dedicate that much time? I mean I wouldn't really care if there was some low points in the middle or so, that tends to happen to some series but I don't want to get a large time investment (audiobook wise about 16days 5 hours or since I work 10 hour shifts listening to them about a month and a half just for the Book of the Fallen series as far as I gather from wikipedia ) if it just turns to complete crap by the end. So Whats the verdict on the investment? Worth it?

TV Guide's "Shows that could be the next GoT" TV Guide posted WoT as a potential replacement for GoT fans, but look at how they summarize the story:

&gt; **9.** [***The Wheel of Time***](https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-wheel-of-time/1242406/) **(Amazon)**
If you like fantasy to be traditional good vs. evil without all the moral complexity of *Game of Thrones*, Amazon's take on Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series may be your pick for next *Game of Thrones*. *The Wheel of Time* is an enormous 14-part series with numerous storylines, and showrunner Rafe Judkins' TV show is going to focus in on the story of a woman named Moiraine as she embarks on a dangerous journey with five young men and women, one of whom she suspects might be the reincarnation of an incredibly powerful individual whose prophecies say will either save humanity or destroy it. An interesting twist is that in this world only women can use magic. *The Wheel of Time* is the best-selling fantasy series since *The Lord of The Rings*, but it's not super well-known outside of the fantasy bubble, so it will be interesting to see if Amazon can make it a hit. *(In development; no premiere date)*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"traditional good vs. evil without all the moral complexity of *Game of Thrones*"

I'm thinking that the article writer hasn't read the series, but calling WoT not morally complex is a huge mis-characterization of the series.

&gt;"focus in on the story of a woman named Moiraine as she embarks on a dangerous journey with five young men and women"

If the show doesn't get out of EotW in the first season, we're doomed...

&gt;An interesting twist is that in this world only women can use magic.

Again, I think the writer hasn't read the series.

&gt;*The Wheel of Time* is the best-selling fantasy series since *The Lord of The Rings*, but it's not super well-known outside of the fantasy bubble so it will be interesting to see if Amazon can make it a hit.

Amazon has made a hit out of a show depicting an alternate reality where the Nazis won, and another about a Jewish housewife who becomes a stand-up comedienne.... I think they can make a hit out of a series second in sales only to Lord of the Rings

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I'm getting excited for the show, but feel like I'm going to need to read the series again before it starts to get my interest back up. Doesn't seem like we'll see it on the little screen any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Mistborn first time reader On chapter 12. So far, compared to what i expected from sanderson based on Elantris i haven't been too impressed.  Everywhere i read that mistborn makes sanderson's writing even better, and even more unputdownable. So far, at this point in Elantris i was hooked, but with Mistborn i find myself merely intrigued. I want to know more about the world and the lord ruler, and kelsier's history but i am not so enthralled by it. It hasn't grabbed me yet.  I can easily go a week without thinking about it whereas Elantris had me hooked and i loved reading about that world. This world seems interesting but i don't feel the same excitement for it yet.  I dont care for the characters as much yet. I get their cause and its a good one, but i dont feel any connection really so far, and i dont feel invested in their goal and cheering them on as much as i was feeling for Elantris.

Is this just me? Does it improve later on in the book? I love big world building epic fantasy like wot so i want to love sanderson, and apart from the somewhat rushed (imo) ending i did feel Elantris was an awesome concept and an aweosme fantasy book. I don't feel like that with mistborn yet even though i am excited to read further in the hopes it reveals more and gets better but ngl i would probably have given up if i hadn't read elantris.

Does the wheel of time get more “gay friendly” as time goes on? In the WoT books before Brandon took over we had “pillow friends” in the White Tower who were female but we never had any openly gay male characters (correct me if I’m wrong). Do you think it was RJ’s original vision to have females who sought comfort in each other’s arms because they were isolated from men and lonely or hated men (I’m thinking the Red Ajah), not because they were inherently gay? Or do you think that gay characters were his intention from the beginning? It seems when Brandon took over we got our first glimpse of men “who preferred men” out of nature not necessity. What do you think? Was it a “politically correct” driver to have homosexuality in the books under Sanderson or was it a deviation from RJ’s vision? Does anyone have any idea of RJ’s views on the issue, any direct quotes that can be cited?

Is Warbreaker low-key the best novel Sanderson has written? I recently finished **Warbreaker** for the first time because

1. It was $6.95 on Audible (don't think it still is, sorry).
2. I'm a completionist and decided I should read it before Oathbringer.

I've read most everything else by Sanderson, including WoT, and I feel like for whatever reason Warbreaker almost never gets brought up. Maybe it's because it was published right before WoK and his WoT books, or maybe it's because he offered it for free on his website for so long and people assumed it was not up to his normal standard.

Either way, I waited forever to read it, and that was a mistake. **This book was good as hell**. The worldbuilding takes a step back, which is weird for Sanderson, but in its place he develops probably his most complex characters, and a plot that genuinely surprised me. This also feels like his most 'adult' work - not grimdark, by any means, but it handles adult things like mental illness, suicidal thoughts, sex, and adult romances to a level that I've never seen Sanderson reach before. And yet it came out 10 years ago!

I know Stormlight is his opus, and WoR is probably his best overall book, but I implore casual Sanderson fans that have not yet read Warbreaker to absolutely check it out. It was everything I always wanted Mistborn to be.

Will I enjoy The Wheel of Time? Just finished the Eye of the World (WoT #1) and I enjoyed it a lot especially the parts with &gt;!Elyas and the wolves or the parts where Mat's personality changes and is noticable to Rand or the chases with the Darkfriends and the Monsters and generally the whole feeling of uncertainty that haunts the second half of the book!&lt;. Other Series I love immensely are Tolkien's works and The kingkiller chronicles. I loved tolkien's attention to detail and expansive realistic world and the relatability I have with rothfusses characters and the completely believable magic system. I generally don't enjoy it when the setting is entirely grim all the way and when things happening get overly ridiculous without a strong believable foundation. I'm ok with characters not being very fleshed out if I can have an enjoyable world and circumastances to engulf me.I also don't mind if it gets a bit slow sometimes if the slowdown is leading to something exciting. Do you think I'll enjoy the rest of the books in The Wheel of Time? Should I invest my time in them or should I read other book series like The Stormlight Archives that have recently peaked my interest? I know this is a vague question but I'm really wondering about what you think about the series and how enjoyable it is to you.

My first comment will be that bot telling me to check out the recommendation link that I've breezed through a thousand times now. I'm a huge Rothfuss fan (prose based) and while looking for recommendations of what to read after WMF, I was lead to the Stormlight Archive. I've finished those 3 (particularly enjoying Words of Radiance) but once again find myself in the familiar boat of What's next? I don't necessarily want to read the EdgeDancer novella and I've already read Auri's story. Would love a good trilogy that is already completed (unlike the previous two mentions.) So here's yet another request for a new series to absorb into.  (Also, I've read: WoT, Farseer Trilogy, ASoIaF, Riftwar Saga, LotR, and a few stand alone's I can't recall now.)

OT (maybe?): First time posting here. What are some of your favorites in the fantasy genre? I used to say A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) was my favorite and always would be, but with the ending to that story looking more and more like it may not be released, I've since changed my mind somewhat. In 2014 I started reading Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, after hearing it was the best fantasy since Tolkien. After two series readings, I have to say I can agree with that very much. Especially after my second time reading the series, it has become my favorite. Even though it still has some darkness to it like GoT, it has more of the black vs white thing I'm a sucker for.

Most recently, I've started and am on book 5 of the Malazan series of fantasy books. This series was a bit harder to get into. Each book introduces so many new characters and has what starts out as separate storylines it makes for a much harder read than GoT or WoT. I am loving it though. The writing may not be the "best" but the characters are what have me hooked on it. By far my favorite character is Toblakai. Typcial barbarian bad-ass with some great depth to his character the more the story unfolds.

What are some of your favorites? And what pulled you into those books?

Thoughts about swordsmanship in wot compared to other books I was just thinking the other night about how Rand is constantly practicing with the sword, calling on the best swordsmen to face off with him and always honing his abilities, same with Lan. Whereas in LOTR for example you don’t see Aragorn ever really practicing. It just shows the detail Robert Jordan includes. As an example, a master musician will be constantly practicing his instrument as opposed to just waiting until their next concert to pull it out and rely on their skill.
I could be off a little in my memory of this since I haven’t read LOTR in a few years and my last read through of WOT ended ~10 months ago but I was thinking about that as I went to sleep last night and just thought it was one of the many testaments to how much thought and detail RJ poured into his works.

Anyone else feel like there is almost no WoT related merchandise to purchase for such a popular series? Every now and again I find myself doing a search for WoT merchandise to purchase (novelties, artbooks, etc), and it strikes me that this franchise is fairly unique in the near complete absence of anything available to purchase given how massively popular/successful the series has been and continues to be.

Anyone else hoping to at least see a legit artbook or something once the TV series is up and running?

Recommendations! So I have read the same several fantasy series throughout my life; Harry Potter, some of LOTR, Inheritance, The Last Dragon Chronicles (Cris D'Lacey, amazing series!!!!) and Narnia. I am currently reading Shannara (on Scions atm almost done). I am looking for recommendations on what to read after this lengthy series (I own all of the books including the two most recent). I just recently picked up the first three books of the "Wheel of Time" series and really look forward to reading them. I also have GoT and Mistborn on my radar but since Shannara is so lengthy and WoT is my next venture I have time to pick those up. Just looking for other high fantasy series to read up. Thanks!!!

[Spoilers all] Finished the series! And how WoT Healed me from Stilling. Warning: Cheezy and pompous anecdote ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and WoT have a very particular relationship. I started the series when I was 13, and read the books that were available to me at that point (up to book 5 or something). It was the series that, along with LotR, sparked my reading interest, though I never got around to finishing it. This spark continued to grow along with the amount of books I read, and long story short I ended up with a masters degree in literary science.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was done at the University, I encountered some sort of "reader's block" - I lost all the joy of reading and never could seem to find my way back to "the Void" where I would be simply consumed by a book and time becomes fluid. This lasted for years and years; I was burnt out. Sure, I could still read, but I could never lose myself in the book, my perspective would always be analytical, critical and cold. It was as if I had turned into a permanent literary critic. I'm sure this sounds like the epitome of a 3rd world problem, but to me it was a joy I couldn't get back. As if I was a child being forced to watch other children play, but never being able to take part in it. Or like someone cut away from the Power.

&amp;#x200B;

...until I started re-reading the series in my 30s. I just felt it again, like someone being healed from stilling. Granted, it came gradually, and I admit it was hard to swallow and accept some parts ("4 pages of describing a dress?" "Why do all the characters have the psyche of 12 year old children when speaking to the opposite sex?"), but it mattered less and less as I managed to lose myself in Jordan's universe.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Sanderson did an amazing job wrapping the whole thing up; he managed to strike the balance between staying true to Jordan's style while also contributing his own. I'll be forever thankful to both of them for bringing me the pure joy of reading back.

&amp;#x200B;

What a ride!

Older reader with limited time looking for some assistance. As the title says, I am an older gentleman with massively limited time to read these days. Over the course of an average week, I can maybe find about an hour and a half to read, due to other commitments.

Due to this massive change to when I was younger, I have to be careful with my books that I pick up just so as to minimise the amount of time spent on books I don't enjoy.

I've done a lot of the classics and tried a lot of the regularly suggested books on here (LOT,  GoT,  WoT, Malazan etc) to varying levels of success (loved LOTR and WoT, not sure I care anymore about GoT and couldn't get into Malazan)

Loved Eddings when I was younger, can't stand him now. Think the Pern books were pretty good for the first 250 or so, but dropped off after that.

I have been reading mainly Urban Fantasy recently, Dresden, Peter Grant, Alex Verus, Iron Druid, Rachel Morgan etc and would probably be more amenable to something along that vein, but not solely.

I am not a massive fan of a massive romantic plot/sub-plot, but as a sub-sub-sub-plot, not an issue.  Not bothered about whether it is a male or female protagonist or author but at the minute, would prefer to stick more of what I do read than to move too far out of what I am familiar with.  Once I have more time on my hands, hopefully not too far away, would be happy to become more eclectic again, but until then, I am afraid I would have to put them on a back-burner.

I do do audio books already, but that time comes out of my limited 'reading' time, so not something I can use to increase my currently available time.

The books listed are nowhere near a comprehensive list of around 40 years worth of reading, so it is possible, I may have missed out some obvious authors I have tried and/or enjoyed.

If you do suggest a series, I would appreciate completed series over ongoing, just down to having read WoT as it was released and not wanting to go through the highs and lows of that again😆

Many thanks in advance for the assistance.

Finished The Dragon Reborn. Do I continue? I’ve found my experience with WoT to be really hit-or-miss in terms of my enjoyment of the series, and I honestly can’t pinpoint why. TDR was equal parts exciting and grueling to read. Is it worth it for me to chug through for the last few books (Branderson is one of my faves)?

Cosmere on late night shows? Recently George RR Martin was on Stephen Colbert show plugging his new release Fire&amp;Blood. And although we all would like to see different book from him (Please no rants about the WoW), it was nice to see a fantasy author doing late night show rounds.

Now I know it is probably because ASOIAF is popular and generally known due to the HBO show, BUT it made me thinking it would be great to see Brandon promoting his SA masterpiece to the general public. Thus growing the fan base and pushing it to the brink of gravitational collapse. Maybe when the SA4 is coming out? Colbert show could be great place to do it as Stephen is fantasy nerd. Or maybe, Henry Cavill could bring his copy of WoR when he will be doing his TV rounds for the new Witcher series :)

I remember old videos of Robert Jordan doing interviews about his then new WoT releases.

What are your thoughts, could something like this help in pushing Cosmere into movie/anime production?

Wheel of Time or The Stormlight Archive? I was on here yesterday asking for a fantasy series and the main ones that interested me was WOT and TSA. Which one should I go for? I know they’re both good, but also both very long, so I wanna make sure I make the right decision.

I’m a massive fan of ASOIAF, LOTR and Harry Potter.

I’m also really worried that I’ll never understand what the hell is going on in these books, as I know they’re very complex, so I’m worried that I’ll just lose interest cos I won’t get what’s going on and who’s who.

With that all being said, which fantasy series should I go for? Thank you all!

A case for havein Loial on the TV show [Spoilers] Hi. Sorry if this is bit rambling and obvious to some people, but I am trying to address some that might want to replace him of erase the whole race.

So I was reading some comments in here on how should Loial or the whole Ogiers race should be represented in the TV show. Some comments said that they could cut Loial right off and not much would be lost, or change him into a human character and give his contributions to some of the characters, or remove their whole race and lore, given how in the first couple of books he is a recurring character and would be on screen a lot of the time, that's if they follow the books, and his character might become an expense to the TV show for them to have a character like him always on screen. I will talk at least about a couple of points in which I think Loial is essential to the story and world building WoT.

* So in my opinion, Loial and the Ogiers are an important part of the WoT series, mostly in the first couple of books, so first lets talk on what happens if they turn him into a human: The series will lose a lot of lore and world building, on why a nobody/random human happen to have the knowledge on how to open and travel the Ways instead of an Aes Sedai, or if they remove his character and made Moiraine know on how to open the Ways and travel them, it will be a bit BS on how she never told tell any other of her sisters how to use them, this will end up breaking and losing the meaning how later in the books Rand discovered Traveling or how the Aes Sedai re-discover it. It was the main way in the series on how they travel/escaped large distances in the first couple of books and with urgency and at the end of that whole thing helps close them off and warn people on how the bad guys are traveling everywhere.
* In world building: They created sanctuaries for the Male channelers to live and slow down the madness and their death. Making them respected among all societies, the unique ways they build steadings bringing something special to show off in world building and fantasy theme than just a normal old medieval setting in some other series.
* Story contributions: He was the one of the first persons that Rand could confide in, even if he didn't know him. And he accepted him and joined his party. He is such a likable character, strong noble and loyal, he is writing his book. And they have their contribution on the last war. And in may battles in the series, specially with Perrin. Like come on! who else could be used to protect or fight and watch his back in battle?! A random two rivers folk?! Pff... Also the main three dont talk about their growth with each others, they talk and confide in Loyal.

He is like Hagrid in Harry Potter, while not one of the most essential characters in the whole series, he brings an interesting point of view and the characters all rely on him. I am a huge fan and Loial who became one of my most favorite characters of all time. The stereotypical **hero** that doesnt identify himself with the word, yet he is.

&amp;#x200B;

Also he needs to write that book of his.

Their lore and old history, etc.

He could be casted like a tall and strong looking actor (with a friendly face), and have him put on face and ear prosthetics instead of cgi, and that could be "it", he doesn't necessarily have to be a freakishly tall like in the books (I mean come on, Elfs are way simpler and we dont complain, just pointy ears and pretty people), or have him be like Hagrid with large custom suits, robotics and prosthetics (harder and expensive). But I think he would look weird if made fully in CGI and would age poorly in the future.

He is like Hagrid in Harry Potter, while not one of the most essential characters in the whole series, he brings an interesting point of view and the characters all rely on him. I am a huge fan and Loial who became one of my most favorite characters of all time. The stereotypical **hero** that doesnt identify himself with the word, yet he is.

Wheel of Time MMORPG Outline - Feedback Wanted Hello Everyone,

Over the last few years I have been slowly working on an outline for what I would create as a Wheel of Time MMORPG, or more accurately, a Virtual World. To be clear, this has been more of a hobby project for fun rather than me actually expecting to make this game. Unfortunately, due to the scale of my idea it is unrealistic to attempt to actually make it without a team of people, the rights to the IP, buckets of money, etc. But who cares? It’s fun to be creative and share ideas with other fans of the series.

My vision is not of an “on rails” linear game like World of Warcraft and its many clones, but rather to create the world of the Wheel of Time, and let you as the player decide your own story and live your own fantasy in RJ’s creation.

I have thought about posting this for awhile, purely because this sub is awesome and I would love to get people’s feedback and ideas about what they would like to experience in an immersive Wheel of Time Virtual World.  I have read nearly every thread others have posted about this topic, and I know that an MMORPG is probably not for everyone - However, I think you will find this to be different from what many people have discussed in the past.

The design (if you choose to read through it) is heavily influenced by certain systems in Star Wars Galaxies. It is also using inspiration from various “old school” MMORPGs/games such as Everquest, Runescape, D&amp;D and even some of the other Wheel of Time projects like WoTMUD and the WoT D&amp;D. It includes features such as the massive openly explorable world, a real functioning player based economy, weak-tie interdependence between players (hint: they will need each other) and truly non-combat professions and skills.  Nearly all of the items players will need, want, and end up using, will be crafted by other players. No carbon copy armor sets from vendors or being traded for using raid tokens. You don’t have to go around swinging a sword in this game if you don’t want to - you can be whatever you want to be. In fact, I started this project purely because I miss when MMORPG’s actually felt like an adventure, felt dangerous and exciting and made me lose myself in the world for hours on end.  The question of “How would you do it?” kept rattling around in my head.

I invite you to read through my initial outline provided via Google Docs, and provide feedback either in the thread or via message.

WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS DOCUMENT UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED THE SERIES. SPOILERS ALL!

How should I read the Wheel of Time series? I've heard that the WOT series is a really good fantasy series though it starts slogging around in the second third of the series. I'm wondering if I should even pick up a series I know will be too boring to finish? I am a perfectionist so I'd really like to complete the series but life isn't forever, I read kinda slow and only read 2 books at a time. I don't want to be reading meh books when I could be reading greats. Your opinion?

No spoilers.. just starting and wanted to say hi! I started The Way of Kings a few days ago. My fantasy genre path has taken me from reading ASOIAF 3 times, followed by the Kingkiller Chronicles, then i started The Wheel of Time. I enjoyed Sanderson’s writing so much that I made Stormlight my next adventure in the genre. I have to say.. I’m completely enamored by this book. Every time the POV switches up I’m both sad that I have to wait to continue with the character i was previously reading, and excited to pick up on the journey of a new one. I loved WoT, dont get me wrong. I think Robert Jordan was a genius. However there is something that spoke to me about the last 3 books of that series, and its come alive now that Ive picked up the Way of Kings.

I just wanted to say hi, and I’m excited to find this sub and be able to discuss the book with all of you. I’ll stay away from spoiler tags of course.. as i see this is mostly an “I already read this” sub... but I’m super pumped to find a sub for these books and look forward to discussing it with everyone once I’m finished. Or here and there when i need to lament with someone on a particularly exciting/touching moment.

Anyone else not excited for the TV show *at all*? I don’t know why I’m such a buzzkill, but I find myself REALLY not excited about the prospect of a WoT TV show.

It seems like TV shows/movies almost always depart from the book in annoying ways, I’m worried about the real-life actors messing with the images of the characters in my head, and it just seems like all the violence and relationships will be way-exaggerated compared to the experience of reading it.

Am I crazy? Anyone else not jazzed about it?

\[Sryrio and Ned\] &gt;!At 3:02 when Ned enters the training room you hear clinks and clanks of   Arya dueling Syrio slowly fade into clamoring  from a   tournament/festival/competition - it doesn't sound like a full on war or   battle. Maybe a memory of someone he remembers from long ago?   Interesting...!&lt;

An Essay on Fan Expectations for the WoT TV Show In light of the recent news that the Wheel of Time TV series will begin filming in Prague in September, I've noticed an uptick in posts along the lines of "I think this will suck and I don't want it to happen." I think that we as fans of this series need to start taking a serious look at this TV show and consider exactly how we as the fandom should react to it.

The implicit point following this announcement is that the show will be filming in eight months' time, likely with the goal of releasing in the Summer/Fall of 2020. We're likely going to start seeing announcements for casting calls in the next few weeks, and odds are we'll have a complete cast by June. Whether we collectively like it or not, this show IS happening.

Now the question becomes: should we be excited or nervous?

The biggest fear I assume we all have about this show is in relation to a number of recent fantasy shows and films that completely do away with huge chunks of the source material and massively disrespect the story they’re adapting. *Eragon* and *The Shannara Chronicles* are two that come to mind. While I feel those fears are founded in context of what we’ve gotten before, we have to consider a number of other factors before jumping to the conclusion that this show will be bad.

First of all, Rafe Judkins and Sarah Nakamura are massive fans of the series. Through social media, they have conveyed deep understanding and immense love of the source material, and since these two are the chief writers of the TV series, I think we can put our faith in them that they know how to adapt the spirit of the books. Looking also at Rafe’s track record (Agents of Shield, Chuck, Hemlock Grove), he’s a solid writer who knows how to run a show.

Second, we need to talk about the elephant in the room: the inevitable changes.

This show WILL be different from the books. Books are a written medium that rely on the reader to build the world in their own mind. TV is a visual medium that doesn't have the opportunity to show you the internal dialogue of the characters. Note that one is not lesser or greater than the other. They are simply different media that convey things in different ways.

As a result, the outcomes of certain events might have to be altered. Dialogue and scenes will be added. Some events might have to be shifted around. Some aspects of the magic system and the side plots may have to be streamlined. Some things might have to be cut entirely, either due to budgetary concerns or inability to translate the scenes to visual media.

We as a fandom need to make peace with this. We need to know and accept that the show will not be identical to the books. We will not be getting a word-for-word, 14-season adaptation. It’s just not gonna work out like that. We also need to know that if the show does go the way of *Eragon* or *Percy Jackson*, then we still have the amazing books to go back to and enjoy.

Another side to this is the inevitable change to the political and social undertones of the books. Yes, this essay is going to get a little political. Sorry (not).

On Twitter, Rafe has discussed his desire to update the books’ politics to reflect modern ideology. This might come as a worry to some fans, but I think this is a very minor issue that will likely be applauded in the long run.

The Wheel of Time book series is unabashedly feminist as it currently stands, though Jordan was much more of a second-wave feminist. The second wave of feminism was particularly prominent in the 1960s-1980s, and focused primarily on the opposition to the domesticity of women that was renewed somewhat after World War 2. Jordan’s portrayal of women was very much in line with the second wave, though in reference to current gender politics and dynamics, adapting the women of the Wheel of Time as as they are in the source material will almost certainly result in criticism of sexism.

Whether you agree with third/fourth-wave feminism or not, such criticism will likely result in unnecessary controversy, poor ratings, and could end with the show’s cancellation. And if the show ends up being really good, why would we want it to be cancelled?

Again, we as fans need to accept and make peace with this. We will likely see an uptick in LGBTQ representation and we’ll likely see some significant changes to the personalities of most of the female characters. We’ll likely see changes to the way Rand’s relationship ends. I doubt any of the three wives will be written out of the story, though I wouldn’t be surprised if he just married one and kept the other two as close friends or advisers.

As a final note on changes in the show, keep in mind that it’s absolutely possible to make an adaptation of a book that is very dissimilar to the source material but is still good. Kubrick’s adaptation of *The Shining* is completely different from the book (famously to King’s dislike), yet is generally considered one of the best horror films ever made. Alex Garland’s adaptation of *Annihilation* is wholly dissimilar to the Southern Reach Trilogy, though is generally thought to be a masterpiece of modern sci-fi.

We as fantasy fans are blessed to live in an era where we have shows like Game of Thrones that are paving the way for dozens of new fantasy TV adaptations. But that doesn’t necessarily men we should just be grateful to have this show. Who knows? Maybe it will end up being really bad and will flop hard with the audience. Maybe it’ll be cancelled after one season and will taint the careers of everybody involved.

But it also has the potential to be one of the greatest live action fantasy adaptations of all time. And it’s this outcome we should be hopeful for.

As fans of the Wheel of Time, we need to do our best to separate the TV show from the books and evaluate it on its own merits. Those merits being the quality of acting, the quality of the production design, the quality of the effects, and the consistency of the adapted/abridged script. The sooner we can have respect for the TV series as its own version of an already-existing, completed story, the better off we’ll be as a fandom.

Shortest time it has taken someone to read WoT? Does anyone know what the shortest time it has taken someone to read the entire series? If not, I am willing to take on the challenge...for the pattern and science.

Going to Mexico on friday for week, looking for a book or series. High Fantasy Hopefully someone can suggest something new and fresh for me.

Things I've already read:
WoT series


Game of Thrones


KingKiller Chronicles


Mistborn Series


Stormlight archives


Assassins apprentice series


Demon cycle


First Law trilogy+related books


Annals of the Black Company


The gentleman bastards


And frankly probably a lot more. I've tried getting into the Malazan book of the fallen series, but had a hard time getting into it. If I can't find anything that peaks my interest I'll probably give it another shot.

I'm looking for something that has really good character development and hopefully doesn't fall for victim to too many fantasy tropes. I love WoT, but I can't stand anymore tugging on braids, smoothing of skirts, Dark brooding Lan Mandragoran's, self sacrificing heroes, or anything else.

But really, I'll read anything thats well written, cause god knows in my search of good fantasy I've also read some real stinkers too.

I want to keep reading WoT but it’s just so hard Hey guys, couple of months ago, I posted regarding having difficulty finishing WoT1. Well I did and it was amazing! And so were 2 and 3! So I went ahead and purchased and started reading Shadow Rising.

But the portrayal of each and every female POV characters is so horrible. Talking about their crushes (seriously is the Elayne/Egwene/Rand triangle even necessary) and their jealousies (even ruined Perrin for me) every other page! And it’s not like we only get those POVs once in a while... I’ve had to read 4 consecutive Egwene/Elayne chapters recently... I’m at my limit!

But this series is otherwise so good... so many noteworthy moments. Rand, Perrin, and Mat are all so interesting, their struggles are so understandable and important.

So I guess my questions are: does it get better and is it worth it?

How to collect the series? Hey there, I am looking to *eventually* purchase the entirety of the WoT series. Do any that have more experience purchasing book series have any advice on the matter?

I’d like to get them in hard cover (though the official Robert Jordan seller on Amazon only sells in Paperback and Mass Paperback..) and most definitely want to get books of the same edition.

Trying to decide between WoT, Malazan, Wars of Light and Shadow, or the Realm of the Elderlings for my next series.    I am really feeling like getting into another completed Epic Fantasy, now that I have finished Shadows of the Apt which kept me enthralled for all 10 of it's books. I'm reading a couple of standalone books atm, just as a palette cleanser before I start my next journey.  The above series all caught my interest after I saw plenty of great reviews/reccomendations of them from this reddit. I am really struggling to pick between them though especially as I hate to stumble upon spoilers while trying to research a book. I am hoping that some of the redditors here who are fans of those series might be able to help me choose!
   I have found that I can enjoy most 'types' of fantasy from grimdark to the most light-hearted of books as well as just about everything in between. What matters most to me is that it is well written, and that  the story, world, or characters can pull me in. I know that is a bit vague though, so here are some of the books I have read and liked in the past year or so.
Recently I have enjoyed:
- Warbreaker and The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson
- Garth Nix's Old Kingdom/Abhorsen series, - Adrian Tchaikovsky's Shadows of the Apt series as well as his Spiderlight and Gun's of the Dawn(I am currently reading this book about 1/3rd into it)
- The Second Apocalypse series by R. Scott Bakker(the last book did get a little too much/dark for me at points but I still enjoyed the series as a whole and the ending)
- Uprooted by Naomi Novik
- Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Stavely
- Nevernight and Godsgrave by Jay Kristoff
- The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisin
- An Ember in the Ashes series by Sabaa Tahir
- Blood Song and Tower Lord by Anthony Ryan(I DNFed the third book but I absolutely loved Blood Song and I was able to enjoy Tower Lord.)
- The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson.
- We Ride the Storm by Devin Madson

This is a question about BOOKS. Opinions please! I would love to pose this question to Dr. JBP himself, and maybe one day I will, but for now I ask the followers of JBP here on Reddit. I believe this line of questioning fits nicely into the JBP thread, and ties into the themes explored in his book (12 Rules).

My time spent reading has dramatically increased over the past half year or so (a life change that was greatly influenced by JBP himself) , and I have thankfully come to realize the absolute necessity of books in the quest for knowledge and life improvement when I still (hopefully) have plenty of time left to get through a large chunk of essential reading material before I leave this world. But along with all the classic and important fiction and nonfiction that is being added to my ever-growing list of books, many of them by JBP's recommendation (won't go into specific titles here, too many) , I continue to read the first genre I fell in love with in my life: High Fantasy. Examples are series such as A Song of Ice And Fire, Lord of the Rings, Kingkiller Chronicles, and the one I am working on currently: The Wheel of Time. This poses a logistical problem: The Wheel of Time (WoT) series consists of 14 books, each of them over 600 pages, and some as much as 900, for a total of 12,000 pages. Many fantasy series are constructed this way, with extremely long formats. That's a lot of time spent working through fantasy series! This means that my reading "highway" is being clogged up by extremely long fantasy books. I am consuming other books alongside this series at a far slower pace than I could be, considering about half my reading time is spent on the pursuit of various fantasy series.

&amp;#x200B;

The question this: Should I give up the fantasy books (after WoT of course, as I am already on book 9 of 14; why quit now?) and stick to more meaningful and applicable books that will directly benefit my life and make me a more well rounded individual? I love the fantasy genre, but is it sucking up valuable and irreplaceable time that could be spent consuming more "useful" literature? I quit playing video games and watching virtually all television media for this exact reason: They waste precious time that should be spent educating and challenging myself with books and the practice of various other disciplines. Is fantasy worth it? Or are the fantasy books just another time-wasting incarnation of video games and TV shows? What are your thoughts, Reddit?

Tom Lloyd's Twilight Reign series Hi All!

I picked up the first book in the series [The Stormcaller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1468912.The_Stormcaller) the first book a while ago (though i forget now how i came across it). I really loved it and have just been reminded (by the 'Big Guys' thread haha). I definitely remember enjoying the heck out the battle scenes and Isak first loosing his powers is one of my favourite fantasy magic scenes for sure!

I quickly got the second book when it was first released, [The Twilight Herald](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1943813.The_Twilight_Herald) but I didn't get through it, I remember get pretty confused by the story and who was who (bare in mind I read Malazan, WOT, ASOIAF etc, and have no issue with multiple viewpoints and epic world spanning stories).

i can't remember really seeing anyone talk about this series - has anyone read them all, did you find the same experience, does it get a bit easier to follow (iirc it was his first published work). Seems as though people who reviewed the series feel like the books get better, as you might expect, but I'd love to hear any thoughts about the books/series!

I see he's also kept writing quite a few more books since then, anyone read those or have thought on how his style has progressed?

What to read next? (A Crown of Swords or Elantris) Hi, I am a bit confused about what exactly to read next. I finished Lord of Chaos (WoT book 6) a month ago. I absolutely loved it but thought I'd take a break from WoT before diving back in. In the meantime, I finished Warbreaker since I wanted to read Sanderson's one off books. Now I have Elantris and A Crown of Swords (WoT 7) sitting on my shelf. Which one should I get to first? I know there isn't any objective way to go about deciding but I'd like to read what everyone has to say.

Finished Book The Great Hunt (Book 2) I [posted after I finished EOtW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/aicjhy/just_finished_eye_of_the_world/) and some people asked me to make another one after I finished The Great Hunt so here it is:

As the title says I just finished The Great Hunt. Wow. This book was at least as good as Eye of the World, probably better. I was so tense throughout the first 100 pages of the book when Rand was trying to escape from the Aes Sedai because I was sure they were going to gentle him. But then the Amyrlin was like "yeet no, we want you to be the Dragon Reborn." I'm pretty happy that Perrin has started to except his wolf powers because they are super cool.  The whole idea of different worlds was something that I really enjoyed too. Selene being Lanfear was pretty obvious to me, but I don't think that Jordan meant it to be all that hard to figure out. At the same time her motives are very strange. One of my favorite parts was Cairhein. The whole political element was super interesting and I honestly wish Rand had spent more time there. Another part I loved was the brief encounters with the Aiel and the hints that Rand is supposed to lead an army of them. Just imaging that from what little I know about the Aiel gave/gives me chills. While I enjoyed the parts at the White towers, however brief they were, they definitely were not my favorite. I did really like how many of the people that Rand encountered at one point or another seemed to remember him or be affected by him in some way.  Liandrin being of the Black Ajah took me by surprise despite me suspecting that she was scheming in some way I though it was just to get at Moraine. I was really surprised by the Seanchan. They seemed to come out of nowhere with almost no warning but I really enjoyed the parts they were in and hope that they return soon. The whole thing with the damane made me really angry while I was reading. In fact I can't remember the last time I hated anyone or anything as much as I hated the sul'dam and Seanchan for what they did to the damane. The end of the book met my expectations and then some. I knew that there would be a large confrontation at the end to try to get back the Horn of Valere but what happened surpassed my expectations. Mat is a certified badass with his dagger (although i do want the bond to be broken). Rand's fight with Turak was awesome. I was super surprised by Ingtar being a darkfriend. The final battle outside of Falme was probably one of the best I've read, right up there with some of the one's from Malazan. I thought for sure that the three ta'veren were done but then Mat blew the horn and I got so hype I had to take a minute to calm down. Rand's battle with Shai'tan was also amazing.

Stuff I reeeeaaalllllyyyyy want to happen:

• Rand gets his Aiel army.

• Rand to get a new sword (maybe the one that is mentioned in the prophecy trapped in a rock).

• Still shipping Rand + Elayne

• Mat becomes free of the dagger

• Perrin finds Elays and learns more about being able to speak to wolves

• Egewen and Nyneave become full Aes Sedai (although Egewene especially seems OP af rn).

&amp;#x200B;

All in all it was a truly spectacular read and I cannot wait to begin the Dragon Reborn.

Thoughts on Casting for the Wheel of Time TV Series Like many of you, I am excited (and nervous) for the WOT TV series. The people in charge of the show seem to be be fans, and also talented writers, which is a good thing. Plus, Amazon has the money to devote the necessary funds to make the show great in terms of locations, costumes, effects, etc. Now that it appears there is a date for production, I have seen interest in thinking about casting grow by quite a bit. So I just wanted to add my two cents.

The main point I want to make is that, although I am a big fan of the books, I hope the production team does not take the character descriptions from the book too much to heart when casting. I think this is a relatively controversial position, but let me explain why.

For most of the characters, the specifics of exactly how they look is relatively inconsequential to the plot of the story and/or the specifics of their character arc and progression. I think it is more important to cast actors who can truly inhabit these roles, especially knowing in advance the specific arc that many of these characters have to go through during the series.

A good example of this is the fact that many fans of the Jack Reacher series were outraged when Tom Cruise was announced as Jack Reacher. In the books Jack is something like 6'6" tall and is a massive mountain of a man. But in the movies, Tom Cruise was able to portray Jack relatively effectively. Mostly because Jack's physical description is a relatively minor part of his overall character. The movies feel like Jack Reacher movies because they got many aspects of the character right, despite the actor not matching the physical description from the book.

So, I care more about getting a cast of young men and young women that have chemistry with each other. Perrin, Rand, Mat, and Egwene are lifelong friends. Nynaeve is the slightly annoying older girl that they have also known their whole lives, yet now that she is older treats them like children. I want actors who can convey these feelings and make me believe the characters. This seems much more important than simply matching the physical descriptions. Yes, I would love the actor cast as Rand to be tall with natural red hair, and for Perrin to be built like a blacksmith. But I think that stuff should be secondary considerations rather than primary.

Furthermore, I think much of the things that people bring up about the physical characteristics that they perceive as being "necessary" could easily be adjusted based on who they cast. In the books Rand is tall and lighter-skinned than the other Emond's fielders, and that is characteristic of Aiel. But if they cast a different actor, they could easily change this so that Aiel are darker and shorter than average than people from Emond's field, and on and on. They could do this with the people from every group. As long as the cast the Aiel, Seanchan consistently, this seems more important than matching the descriptions, hair colors, and skin tones from the books.

I think this issue is also why some names seem to come up a lot. There is a reason that Idris Elba comes up in fantasy casting for Lan. It is because many of the characters he has portrayed, have some of the same stoic fierceness present in Lan. And so he feels like a good fit, even if physically he doesn't completely match Lan's description in the books.

So, although I think fantasy casting just based on physical appearance is not bad. I would love to see more discussion of what aspects of the character are the absolute essential aspects that an actor must convey. Thom Merrilin has to be feel like someone who has lived a full  life, is weary and yet still has joy in his heart. He has to be able to hold a crowd in silence with his tales, yet also believably show that he can fight viciously and save the boy's lives. Mat needs to be someone who pretends like he is cool and above the fray, but who everyone knows is actually self-conscious and nervous, but is also absolutely rock solid with integrity and friendship. We need actors who will pull people in that aren't fans of the book, but stay because they love what the show is.

Looking for the next "epic" fantasy Hi all,

I'm trying to find something to tide me over while Stormlight and Light Bringer are still in development.

I've read LotR, WoT, Malazan, GoT, Night Angel trilogy, Stormlight, and Light Bringer

I've really become a fan of Brent Weeks; he can get dark and gruesome, but he doesn't linger there like Martin does.

WoT was my least favorite of those, and Malazan or Light Bringer were my faves.

By Epic, I mean at least a trilogy, hopefully more. I'll take a smaller, well-written trilogy over a sprawling and incoherent epic though!

Thanks :D

Something hilarious I caught on my first re-read (Lord of Chaos Spoiler) Mat's visit to Salidar is one of my favorite scenes in the series, and I was absolutely dying going through it on the reread. One moment, in particular, was just pure gold - when Mat is dancing with Halima, 'one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen', but eventually stopped because she was looking at him weirdly and 'kept trying to lead while dancing'.

Knowing what I know now about Halima, this had me *rolling*.

These little details are what make me adore WoT.

Epic fantasy, anyone? Hello!

Looking for a good Epic Fantasy book!
I enjoy faster-paced stuff like the Gentlemen Bastards series by Scott Lynch, but I'm open to anything really.
Other series I enjoyed were WoT, Asoiaf, LotR, the First Law trilogy, and that ember in the ashes novel (it was all right).

I'd prefer a stand-alone book or a short series, nothing over 4 books, as life has made it harder and harder to commit to longer series (insert sadness here)

Thanks in advance!

Tent Flaps I just wanted to share that when I read WoT, RJ must have said 'tent flaps' perhaps a thousand times. It obviously makes sense, as a lot of temporary shelter is used in war camps, but the amount of times I read the words 'tent flaps' seemed comical. It's still the best fantasy series I have read of course, I just wondered if anyone else had noticed this, or if it was just me being weird.

Make me read WoT There is a brand new edition of WoT in Bulgaria due the the TV series starting. I have all of the books on my kindle. However I am a book freak, so normally new books--&gt;new covers--&gt; make me buy  the physical books.

I am no stranger to long series. Just tell me that I should invest in that series and tell me why !

[No Spoilers] Are there any Malazan podcasts for a first-time read through? I'm about 100 pages into GotM, and I'm finally to the point where I understand what's going on. I'm starting to really enjoy the book, but one thing that makes series more enjoyable to me is having some external material about the series.

The Legendarium podcast generally does these, but as far as I can tell they haven't done Malazan. I listened to their episodes on WoT and Stormlight as I finished each book, and I feel like it really enhanced my experience.

Is there any podcast like this for Malazan? Whether they are going through each chapter, or just recapping at the end of each book, I would be interested in listening.

[Spoilers for the main 6 films and the Prequel TV shows] Rather convoluted idea to watch the series in order to get a better plot twist than the big one (episode V) Now, this might seem a little bit weird. How is it possible to get a better plot twist than "the bad guy is everybody's dad"?

Glad you asked.

Now I'm going to assume that Obi is a person watching the series for the first time with no spoilers. You are obi's friend and must tell him how to watch itThe first thing we need to do is to start watching the series in chronological order. This gives proper build up for the plot twist's shock. You need to watch Episode I (necessary for its introduction of Jin and Maul), Episode II and Chronological TCW. Remember to tell Obi to skip the scene in season 3 when the Son shows Anakin the future, it gives away too much. Also if other episodes in the future happen after ROTS skip them and watch them after E3. Then you need to skip Episode III and tell Obi that

* Palpatine (who he knows from TCW is Darth Sidious) got most seppies killed off and shut down the Droid army
* 99% of the Jedi were killed by the clones (again no shock here he already knows that from season 6)
* Sheev became the first galactic Emperor taking over the galaxy and took a new apprentice named Darth Vader, who was essentially his right hand man and controlled the Inquisitorius, daksiders that hunted down jedi survivors.

I think you can see where this is going. Tell Obi to watch Rebels. With season 2 and Vader referring to Ahsoka as Skywalker's apprentic Obi has no suspitions until episode 18, when Ahsoka finds out who the SITH LAWD is. And tbh, there's not much to say about this. Cooler setup, far higher shock to realize that Anakin turned rather than realizing that Luke has a bad dad, more attachment to the main character, seing how actually badass the villain was, the mistery surrounding Anakin's fate while being 90% that that black boi isn't Anakin.

Then Obi shouldn't watch the last part of the Rebels finale obviously because it's a huge spoiler for ROTJ,and then watch Episode III (you need to watch it before RO to take Vader seriously after the NOOOOOOO), then the parts you skipped in TCW, then go RO ANH ESB ROTJ and watch the Rebels finale. Then watch the rest in C.O.

Really the only problem I can find with this is that Obi loses the watching-Episode-III-for-the-first-time depression but you have all TCW to decide wot he'd like more.

Now you are free to kill me with words OT fans.

Starting The Eye of the World- Any advice? So I am going to start Book 1 tomorrow. I'm having surgery in a couple days and will have plenty of free time coming up.

I was hoping to get some advice on the series for a first time reader. I'm a huge LotR fan, and I also love Sanderson's Stormlight Archive. Aside from those series (and in Tolkien's case, the wealth of additional 'supplementary' works) I haven't got much experience with lengthy, multi-book fantasy series.

So needless to say, despite being recommended WoT on many occasions, it's hard not to look at a 14 book series and feel some trepidation at such an undertaking.

What can I expect? Especially from the early books. Does Robert Jordan's writing style start off slow, but pick up in subsequent books? Or is it just the opposite, with the mid-books sagging at times?

I struggle at times with memory problems, making it difficult to follow stories and lists of characters that are TOO sprawling. So, are the books incredibly character heavy, or is the main list of protagonists reasonably small as we go from book to book?

That's all I can think of for now, but of course I would genuinely appreciate any other insights or tips for tackling the series (spoiler free, please!)

Thanks, excited to get started.

Erikson is actually a genius. I'm at the start of HoC, but the more I read this series - the more in awe I am of how unique it actually is.

Every other fantasy series I've read, seem to constantly fall into the same sorts of clichés, use many of the same types of characters - like elves or dwarves, typical good vs evil, God's are untouchable, etc.

For me, Tolkien was the first pioneer - he obviously drew much inspiration from Norse Mythology, but he was the first to really draw up a cohesive and expansive fantasy world with some degree of originality.

A while back I tried to read WoT - and couldn't go any further because it bugged me how much is ripped off from LOTR. To the names of places which are almost identical or phrases used.

But Malazan is totally unique. I don't understand how Erikson was able to be so original, only explanation is that he's a genius. Obviously there are things like Dragons in Malazan but what's a good fantasy book without a dragon? Haha. And that's only one tiny facet of this multi faceted masterpiece.

Often when I'm reading other fantasy, when I'm reading said book, it reminds me of other books because of common themes, common character traits, similar magic systems etc. But I haven't got that once while reading Malazan.

When did WoT peak for you? I’m currently finishing TEotW and I keep reading that for some people the series peaked about book three or five. Considering there’s 14 books and supposedly books 8-9 (I think) are slow-paced/fillers, what kept you going?

Standalone or series? Wondering whether you guys think writing a standalone (or novel/s focusing on one character) or attempt at a series (with bigger cast of characters (very much love WoT and aSoIaF, though maybe wouldn't go for such a big scale of characters)) would be better as a first time?
I don't have many "reader" or "writer" sorts of friends, and thus no one really to ask questions like this to.
Cheers!

Game of Thrones pieces of puzzle 10: Cultural References across the books and the show In this current age of fusion literature or visual media there is seldom anything called a successful original work. Gold of 24 caret can be pure, but is of no value because you cannot make anything out of that pure gold. One thing I love about the show and the books are the diverse cultural references therein, it tastes like a food that has taken conceptual ingredients from diverse sources, and mixed them to an exotic proportion.


I am not even sure I will be able to list ALL cultural references in the show and the book, but these few come to my mind when I think. Most of these are known to everyone, still just to put them in a list.


a. Medieval British history: the war of roses, the red wedding, the purple wedding, the 100 year's war.


b. Medieval tribe of the great Khan, the Mongols, Tatars and Kyrghyzians depicted in Dothraki culture.


c. Persian fire-worshippers in the faith of Lord of the Light.


d. Holy trinity in Christianity and Hinduism in Three-eyed raven.


e. Bodhi tree in Buddhism in Weirwood, meditation and mind control as seen in eastern philosophies such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Sufism.


f. Sizdah (Islamic bow or submission) or Sastanga Pranama of Hinduism when Dothrakis bend their knee. The Sun rising in the west, setting in the east, rivers going dry and mountains flying in the wind like leaves - description of doomsday in Islam. Satidah, an ancient ritual in Hinduism when Daenerys walks into Khal Drogo's pyre.


g. Four riders of the apocalypse in Christianity as seen in the Hardhome hill where Night King and the white walkers stare down the one-sided war.


h. The dark lord, fellowship, elves (Children of the Forest) of LoTR.


i. Storm king, abnormal season cycles and the great war from Memory, Sorrow and Thorn.


j. Lastly a number of references from The Wheel of Time. Andor-inhabitants as Andals, Great evil unleashed for great power (Night King), thirteen forsaken as thirteen Lord Commanders, All male going mad with All men must die, male baby white walker forces and in Valar Morghulis, only female Children of the Forest remaining as Aes Sedai, Dragon reborn Rand or Lord of the Morning or Prince of the Dawn as Azor Ahai reborn, Wolf brothers as northerners, Callandor as Lightbringer, Icy fire and normal fire applied against each other producing crystals (dragonglass). Capability of modifying timeline and Rand as Bran.  Elayne, Mat or Egwene as Daenerys, Faile or Egwene as Arya, Perrin the warrior blacksmith with a hammer and being Faile's husband as Gendry, Mat as Beric or Jon as well, Moiraine as Melisandre, Horn of Valere as Horn of Dragon/Winter resurrecting dead warriors from crypts, Westlands as Westeros, far east region of Shara as Asshai, the northern land of Great Blight as Land of Always Winter, Fairstrider as Longstrider, Age of Legends as Age of Heroes, the Breaking as the Long Night, Arthur Hawkwing as Aegon the Conqueror and so on. The similarities are of such a high scale that some people theorize GoT ending based on WoT ending :).


If I miss out any cultural references, (I believe I must have because there are so many), please add them. Thanks!

Why did it turn so boring? (Spoilers up to A Crown of Swords) I want no spoilers here, please... But answer me somewhat without those.

I am in chapter 12 of A Crown of Swords and the books are so boring by now I just want to quit reading WoT. Will it get better any time soon or should I just skip a few books or just quit? I just cannot find the enjoyment in reading a few more whines from Egwene that noone takes her seriously as Amyrlin, Rand does legit nothing these past few chapters and even before, in the whole book, he did not do much, Perrin is just fussing over jealous Faile and nothing is happening AT ALL.


I miss the thrill of the first books, running from Trollocs with Mirdraal being scary, Fain waiting in the shadows, our heroes trying to find their own way through this while actualy being small and insignificant.


Now Rand is the most powerfull human of all time killing Forsaken left and right who just discarded Callandor for no reason, just so there is any tension in anything left. And if he is not powerfull enough, he has the bigest army since ever and Ashaman as extras. And with the Callandor, he could just smite anything. Egwene is Amyrlin for some reason, Matt is the best general since the time of Hawkwing cause of magical memories, Perrin is not only a wolfman (which is actualy cool) but also for some reason a god of war with his axe, killing even Aiel.


Where are the Trollocs that could jump our heroes for the shadows and eat them? Where are the Mydraal that gave the shivers to even Aes Sedai? Where are the Aiel where one Aiel killed several Children with no weapon? How could Perrin survive 5 minutes in a battle with the Shaido?

&amp;#x200B;

The books just turned to slog and there are 8 more books. Nothing in these books I am now reading actualy matters to the main story much, does it?

All Stories; New to the Series Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I just ordered some books to get me started on this series I have heard so much about.  There are 14 main books, so I know those are the ones I need to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering, what if I wanted to read all the stories in the WoT series?  For example, The Eye of the World was re-released as two books in 2002, From the Two Rivers and To the Blight.  From the Two Rivers came with a, I'm guessing never before seen, prologue called Ravens.  Therefore, I ordered the two separate books so I could read the extra prologue not seen in original novel.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there other stories, like Ravens, in the WoT series that I should be aware of if I want to read 'everything'?

What is your controversial opinion regarding a series, a book, an author, or a character? Be it positive or negative. For example, I read the WoT series a couple years ago and enjoyed it. I recently went to re-read The Eye of the World and could only get halfway through before I realized I didn't want to read the series again; and in fact, I didn't much care for it.

What about you? Discuss.

I finally finished the Wheel of Time series! I started this series over a decade ago in high school, and gave it a few tries. While I enjoyed it, I normally ended up five books in, before turning to other series'.

During the natural ebbs and flows of reading, I found myself exclusively enthralled with the series again last year. This time, I made it through, and it was by no means a slog. High fantasy is my favourite genre and WoT lived up to all of my expectations and more.

I was a little worried when I started the last three books (this is where Brandon Sanderson picks them up) but he took care of all the characters. I really need to get into Sanderson's work now!

It has been my world for so long, and now that I've finished I miss the world and the characters terribly. I feel like this is the only place I can share all this!

I'm currently reading the Throne of Glass series - Sarah J Maas is visiting my city later in the year so I have to finish those books before attending her lecture /signing.

How to keep everything Cosmere fresh in my mind when reading other series? Over that last few months I’ve finally gotten around to reading every Cosmere book, after being introduced by Way of Kings. I finally feel like I have a really good grasp of everything going on, and things to look out for in Brandon’s writing.

However, I’m nearly done with my SA reread (what a different experience, being Cosmere aware). Part of me wants to go through and reread all the books again, to really make sure I’m not missing anything (lol). But I’ve been planning on starting WoT for awhile now, and that will be my next move.

I’m nervous it’s going to be like when you come back to an RPG after a few months, and have no clue what was going on.

So to everyone that’s taken a break from the Cosmere for other things; how do you keep everything in mind? I’d hate to pick up a Cosmere book a few months from now and feel like I’ve forgotten a lot of info, or that I’m mixing in things from other series. Any tips for staying sharp on all the intricacies, other than rereading everything later on?

Sex &amp; Nudity, Violence &amp; Gore, Profanity What do you think is the target age group for the books? What ages should the show target? The books contain a lot of adult content, but I don't think it's treated in an explicit manner. Here is what I mean:


**Sex &amp; nudity.** Sure, nudity is mentioned consistently throughout the series. But most of it is told through the eyes of the 2 Rivers' folk. They are always surprised when people don't dress according to 2 Rivers' sensibilities. This ranges anywhere from disapproval of non-woolens to shock when the boys see a Seanchan servant's sheet clothing. There is also a lot of sex in the books, but (if I remember correctly) the reader is not privy to the details. Sex is referred to, rather than described. 


**Violence &amp; gore.** This is a fantasy series filled with blood, death, and guts. As with nudity, reading RJ's description is different from seeing severed limbs (Trolloc or human) on the screen. What is the appropriate line for the show? 


**Profanity.** I just finished TGH on my reread and Uno by far is the most profane character in the book. But in the WoT world, that means he says "flaming," "bloody," and "burn me!" If the show draws a Mature rating, it shouldn't be for language. I think the profanity topic nicely ties in with RJ's depiction of his fantasy world. It is very real and doesn't shy away from adult content, but doesn't push away younger audiences and squeamish adults. 


What do you think is appropriate for the show? Will it be as "gritty" as GoT? Or as approachable as the LoTR movies?

Looking for fantasy books like Wheel of Time, Kingkiller Chronicles I don't want this thread to be too long and boring, so I won't give a huge rambling preamble.

My favourite fantasy series of all time is The Wheel of Time. I think that I don't fall into the pitfalls that a lot of people do related to it, because I care a lot less about plot than most people. It's important to me, obviously, but I'm really interested in the characters, and plot is almost like an excuse to get the characters to do interesting stuff. And the characters in WoT are many, varied, and (almost) universally interesting and kinda loveable in their own way. Also, all of the main characters undergo huge changes over the course of the series, which is something I really like.

Kingkiller I like for a lot of the same reasons. I don't really care that Kvothe is crazy good at everything he does because I'm more interesting in how he is as a character. As a result, the parts of the books I enjoyed most were when he was put to the test on a personality level, like in his failures at courting Denna, his inability to swallow his pride with Ambrose, etc. I also love side characters, and just watching them come in and out of the story and pushing Kvothe into different situations (Wise Man's Fear is especially good at this due to it's wandering nature).

Another book series that I love for this reason is Harry Potter (although I fully admit that a lot of that comes from nostalgia goggles). The cast grows up over the course of the novels, they go through crises, periods of arguing with each other, etc.

An author that I *don't* like as much (although I've still somewhat enjoyed the stuff he's done) is Brandon Sanderson, because while he can certainly create a gripping plot and an interesting world, I find a lot of his characters to be *very* dull and one-dimensional. I also feel like the dialogue and prose is just a bit too YA for me.

I also don't have much need for closure, so if a series is unfinished, that's fine by me. As much as I want Doors of Stone to be released, for example, it's not really because of all the plot ends that I want tied up, it's just because I want *more.* In fact, I felt like the end of a Wise Man's Fear involved a lot of closure, character-wise, which as I believe I've beaten you over the head with enough already, is my largest concern.

Another series I've tried and failed with is Malazan. I've gotten about 1/3 of the way through Gardens of the Moon, but I just can't do it. If I had more free time, I would try to power through, but something important to me with fantasy, at least, is that I don't have to power through it. I want it to suck me in so I forget I'm reading it at all.

That's a big reason I liked Wheel of Time so much---despite having an enormous world and a huge cast of characters and a sprawling, spiderwebbing plot, it still managed to be very consumable without having to force myself to power through (yes even during the crossroads of twilight slump).

A couple other notes, I've read A Song of Ice and Fire before, and it was alright. It was a long time ago, so I don't really remember. I've also forgotten what the other thing was I was going to write here so I'll edit the post to add it in when I remember.

I'd appreciate any suggestions you guys can throw my way!

So I just finished A Crown of Swords and... (Spoilers for the ending) The ending really bothered me. Throughout the books we saw how Sammael was a tactical genius when it came defense and that he had some plans cooking up alongside with Graendal. However, this all went to the garbage heap when he got the same treatment Rahvin did. It's like RJ had something planned for him in the long run but in the end he decided to kill him off.

 He was easily one of the most intriguing Forsaken and seeing him go out like that was a bit underwhelming. This whole teleport to the city&gt;kill the Forsaken there&gt;conquer the city route is getting a bit tiring and it only happened twice. I hope there is something resembling a change in terms of how the Forsaken are dealt with in the upcoming WoT books I plan on reading.

Apologies for the rant but I wanted to hear the opinions of the sub on the ending.

Sooooo I fianlly finished a Memory of Light yesterday night And Damn I feel empty now. What a journey, best book series I read till now. I will miss Mats banter, Elayne and Nynaeve traveling through the world arguing over everything and Rand being a damn bad ass. Honestly I feel like know each of those characters like I met them and will really miss them. Already excited for my first reread whenever that will be. There was more than one time, especially towards the end when I shed a tear or laughed out loud.

Allthough it's obivously a tragedy that Jordan died before finishing it, I think Sanderson style was very fitting for the last three books, so those didn't get bogged down with Braid tugging and stuff. Tarmon Gaidon was god damn epic (sorry Thom but I am nt a poet) and the whole last book being just battles was exactly what was needed to finish that series.


But especially after the battle and Merrilor it felt a bit rushed. Padan Fain, being built up since the beginning, was defeated in a few sentences and Lanfear reutrning felt like it happened only to give Perrin some relevandy in the Last Battle. I don't know how detailed Jordan described what should happen but Perrin felt pretty left out in the Last Book, yeah he Battled Slayer and kind of saved the Day twice, but Mats part in the Last Battle was just much more exquisite and relevant.

The End was great I think and exactly how you should finish something like WoT, it would have felt unsatisfying if Rand would have died for real and him not being able to channel but just being ably to bully the wheel it compliance was great and mysterious. Its sad that Tam, Mat and Perrin don't know that he actually survived and I kind of hoped that we would get atleast a paragraph of bullshit between the three Taveren after it all ended, but in my Mind they met up years afterwards in a common room and talked about all their adventures.

All of this has probably been posted hundreds of times but I don't knoiw anybody else who read so i just wanted to get it of my mind.

Oh and Cadsuane got exavctly what she deserved. And I am kinda sad that Rand in the end didN#t departed on Bela, she was the real MVP if the series.

Finished The Way of Kings for the first time... First time reader here. I knew Sanderson from him finishing up the Wheel of Time, but beyond WoT and the Lord of the Rings, I have never been a big fantasy reader. My brother gave me a paperback of WoK years ago and after many failed starts, I decided to get it off my TBR stack in 2019.

I think it had two things going against it at first: 1. The world-building is intense and initially overwhelming. 2. The story is almost all prologue for about the first 900 pages.

That said, I really liked how it came together in the end. Kaladin, Dalinar, the plot on the Plains, Shallah and the ending on Kharabranth (sp?). And.... it totally sets the stage for the rest of the series. Good stuff!

Sword&amp;Sorcery/Military fiction book recommendations Hello,

I am looking for interesting books with a good plot with amazing battles/characters going on an epic journey barely able to survive/or doing glorious last stands, if there is raunchy scenes or romance involved that is a bonus.

Some of the books I previously enjoyed in the genre:
The Red Knight

WoT series (Particularly Eye of the World/Great Hunt/Dragon Reborn/Shadow Reborn/A Memory of Light)

The Gates of Fire

The Virtues of War

The Conan the Barbarian pastiches.

I am looking for something to just pull me in and not release me until the book is done.

Any help would be appreciated.

About to finish WoT, looking for what's next I'm about to wrap up my first full read-through of Wheel of Time. It has seriously rocked my world and has replaced LOTR/Tolkien as my favorite series and universe of all time (after twenty years). But really... other than Tolkien, Narnia and HP as a kid, and now WOT, I haven't read much fantasy other than a few stabs here and there. I can already tell I'm going to have a huge existential crisis after this series is over, so I'll be needing something to fill the void afterwards. Hence, looking for recommendations.


Are you new to Fantasy or have you read many of the greatest hits?


Like I said, I'm a deep-delver of Tolkien, read all of his stuff as a kid and teenager and occasional re-reads over the years. I mostly come from Sci-Fi World, big fan of Dune, Haruki Murakami, Asimov, Dick, etc., as well as a lot of cyberpunk. And now Wheel of Time.

What traits do you most value in books, for example: Characterization, Prose, Story, Setting, etc.?

Really all of the above, but I'd have to say characters and setting are the most important to me. Well-written characters in an interesting setting.

What are some books that you read and enjoyed and what did you like about them?

Obviously, Wheel of Time. The setting was interesting, the story was deeper than "quest to kill the bad guy", and the characters are top-notch (even though people complain about Jordan's female characters, I enjoyed them a LOT as a woman reader... except Faile).

Then there's LOTR. The depth of the lore and worldbuilding there is un-matched.

What are some books you read and disliked and what did you dislike about them?

I remember trying to read the Dark Tower series but I think I'm just not very into Stephen King's writing style. It felt really "pulp fiction" to me. I'm honestly not into Harry Potter either; I never finished the series and got bored around book 4. Also hated Inheritance Cycle for being super-derivative and badly written. Couldn't get into ASOIAF because I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters.


Are you looking for a series or a standalone novel? If a series, does it need to be completed?

I'd prefer a completed series or really chunky standalone novels. I read really fast (I've been through books 12 and 13 of WoT in a week, for example, and can blast LOTR in less than that).


Are you interested in classics, modern works, or does it not matter?

Doesn't matter to me.

What manner of tone? Lighthearted, grimdark, or something in between?

Something in-between. I don't want too grimdark but I don't want happy bunnies either.


what complexity and depth level? Simpler, straightforward, and easy to digest; or sprawling epic spanning multiple continents and thousands of years?

I'm good with a high amount of complexity and depth. I'd say in the WoT ballpark or beyond.


Anything specific you are looking for, like a female main character, books about thieves or assassins, non-medieval Europe analogue setting, or talking animals?

Non-medieval setting is a plus, and female main characters are a HUGE plus but not a main factor.

WOT and other sucky first books I read the first book in the WOT series in college and hated it because I felt like Robert Jordan was copy/pasting LOTR. 15 years later, after having read also everything worth reading in the world, I started listening to the audio books.
And wow. I'm in love. I guess my lesson is... Don't judge fantasy by it's first book?
Any other series that gets better past book one? I've dropped Mazalan, The Dark Tower, and, this is embarrassing... Diskworld.

RJ's writing style and convincing my mom to continue reading I see you, fellow WoT zealots.

I recently finished the series after roughly 1 year, and I obviously love these books (otherwise I wouldn't be here and over at r/WetlanderHumor every day).

A couple of days ago I convinced my mom to start reading EotW (in Spanish, her native language) and she's told me that she thinks that EotW is written "poorly", and compared it to the similarly "poorly" written Twilight series, which is probably the gravest insult to the WoT I have heard lol. She has been reading a lot of different genres during her whole life, also all the Fantasy classics like Harry Potter, LotR, ... .

I obviously don't want her to give up yet on this series, and while reading it I focused more on the plot development rather than on the writing style, so I'd like to ask about your opinion on these questions:

* Do you really think the books are written poorly? Does it get better?
* How would you convince her to continue reading? What would you highlight as the strength of the series so I can convey that to her?

With your help I might be able to save one person from becoming a darkfriend (=every person that dislikes WoT), and show her ignorant and errant soul the glory of the Light.

May you find water and shade.

My advice/wishlist for writers of WOT tv show Here is some advice for the people working on the WOT TV show. This isn't about specific actors or plot points, but a more broad set of wishes that I am hoping writing and creative team will consider.

1. Have someone monitoring fan sites, but not too close. My guess is that someone from the writer's room is already doing this. But my reasoning is that for the show to succeed, fans need to embrace it and help sell it to others. So the showrunner and others should at least know the things fans are thinking about. But, the danger here is that for them to be creative, they will need some distance. So they need to strike a balance.
2. Continue to engage with fans in fun ways, even while maintaining the necessary secrecy. Many of the fans of the books are long term fans. I grew up reading the series. Many of us also dove into various fan communities. I even used to go on the old message boards in the mid 90s. So, related to my first point, if the creators of the show demonstrate that they understand and love these communities, they will continue to get my support. One way to do this would be to include fun easter eggs for long-term fans.
3. Have a plan. Use the time now, not just to write season 1, but to plan how to tackle the entire series. Plan in advance how to handle the plot for the whole series. My recommendation would be to have two plans, a pessimistic plan (what to do if the show is only popular enough to get 3-4 seasons) and an optimistic plan (what to do if the show can get 6-8 seasons). Werthead did a great post about this on his blog that showed a really strong way to think about structuring the seasons. One of the big advantages to the WOT is that it is complete. Use that to your advantage.
4. Consider trying to be inclusive when making the decision about the appropriate level of content (e.g. how much nudity, swearing, graphic violence, etc.) Personally, I have a strong preference for a more PG-13 version. But I understand that other people feel differently. If the creators of the show decide to go for a more "adult" feel, I hope they consider fans with families, etc. We live in the modern, digital age. Content is streamed in multiple ways. Why couldn’t there be two slightly different versions for slightly different audiences? Why not an "R" and a "PG-13" version that people can choose?
5. Cast a wide net for actors. While I don’t care that much about matching physical descriptions, many hard core fans do, so why not at least try to find great actors who are at least close to how the characters are described. I think the Expanse is a great example of a show that has tried to do this. The people running the show looked hard to find an actor who could play Bobbie. So, I hope the creators of the TV show look beyond just Hollywood when finding the right actors.
6. Consult with Team Harriett and also Brandon Sanderson. Please let them have a chance to at least give notes on every script. Avoid the Lightning Thief problem.
7. Give us cool stuff. I would like to see better merchandise options, Prizeo-style charity auctions for set visits, great web content, and more.

German speaking WoT readers, what authors do you recommend Because The Wheel of Time is my favourite fantasy series I wound love, if somebody who likes it equally could give me a recommendation of German fantasy authors I should check out.

I read English authors in original and while I love my increased English vocabulary for medieval wappons and horsemanship, it would be great to read something in German sometimes :D

[Spoilers All] I'm cautiously optimistic for the WoT TV show, please don't ruin it for everyone else with aggressive negativity. While it can certainly be fun to theory craft and speculate on casting, lets not think for one second that ANY of us could do a better job at a WoT TV adaptation than Rafe and the team that Amazon/Sony are putting together.  They have a monumental task ahead of them that even they will struggle with, but thinking that any regular old guy (me or you) could do a better job is just lunacy.

Sure, they won't do a perfect job in any of our eyes.  They're going to change things that we (at first) wish they didn't, and it will be tempting to criticize and bash the material that they release.   BUT!
 we need to consider how our actions could affect the long term success of this (and future fantasy) series.  How many TV series have a lack luster first season, and only start to shine after they pick up speed?  Do we really want to attack (possibly even kill) something before it even has a real chance to succeed?

I'm not saying that we fans are likely to make or break the show, but theres always a chance that we, collectively, could have a positive influence on the long term outcome.

However, if what they release is clearly as bad as the Shannara or Legend of the Seeker adaptations, then everything I've said is moot.  BUT! I personally believe we're already in a much better place than those adaptations, simply because of who is at the reins.

tl;dr; Give it a chance before mindlessly criticizing.  Its OK to be skeptical, but if you really don't like it, just stick to the books.  Letting others enjoy the tv series does you no harm.

Just finished my first read.....wow I just finished A Memory of Light. I already read New Spring so I’m feeling some of the withdrawals already. After I read the Epilogue if AMOL, I just took a big breath and said  wow. I started reading the Eye of the World during the middle of April 2018. There were gaps between my readings and I didn’t read any for about 2 months.

I’m only 12 but I have to say that WOT is definitely my favourite book series. I really enjoyed TDR, TFOH, LOC, KOD, TGS, and, of course, AMOL. However, I do wish that for the beginning of AMOL Sanderson kept to the norm of only switching perspectives every few chapters. I get that it creates a chaotic and frantic scene, but after a while it stopped feeling like a WOT book (which drags on travelling).

I really, really liked the series and was wondering if anyone could tell me of any companion books (I heard there was one) and what other message boards or other resources there are to do with the series.

It was a great ride and I’m glad that I had this subreddit to be my companion for it. :)

Flashbacks in the First Season From the admittedly limited amount I've been able to read about the upcoming Amazon project... I'd like the WoT community's input to a few of my concerns, and/or lack of them.  It sounds like RJ's widow is a creative producer and others involved have been fans of the universe for years.  How extensive does everybody think the use of flashbacks to familiarize non-readers with the WoT universe?  How quickly will the story of Lews Therin, BoTW, etc. come to light?  Will we quickly learn of all the different Shadowspawn, or as they appear in the books?  Would it make sense to start with New Spring, or might that be wrapped up in the first couple episodes?  The history of the Aes Sedai alone is so deep, can it be covered in a series?   I'm optimistic as I can be... I've looked forward to this since 1991.

Grant me strength, my friends Currently on book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, of the Wheel of Time series. About 7 or so chapters in but I've been finding it very hard to finish this book up. I absolutely blew through the previous books and have been enjoying them so much, but recently I've been struggling to read more than a chapter at a time, sometimes only making it through a couple pages or so.

Without this becoming too long a post, I wanted to ask my fellow WoT fans to gimme some motivation! Use your words to get me to read this damn good book again! I know you all are linguistically gifted by the Light so no excuses...

Thanks!

Why Gawyn is the way he is So I've been working through my third read through and I'm currently nearly done with Book 13.  It's been slow going since I don't have so much free time to read, but that's allowed me to really digest some aspects of the book that I had glossed over during my prior two reads.  At the forefront of those glossed-over parts are the characters I dislike, Gawyn the most.

Before this read through I hadn't taken the time to look at Gawyn's underlying motivations.  Yeah he's obviously an asshole who almost no one in the fandom likes, but what specifically turned him into that asshole?  He was a pretty likable character in the first book after all.  So here's my thoughts on why Gawyn became a huge wad of dicks.

And no this isn't a defense of him.  I still hate him the most out of any WoT protagonist.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Gawyn's entire place/purpose in life was destroyed in just a few months.  From birth he had been one of the top royalty in one of the top nations in Randland.  His entire life mission was to become First Prince of the Sword, general of Andor's military and right-hand to the Queen.  He was one of the most important people in the world.  He was likable in EoTW because his self-image was still consistent with who he thought he should be.  He thought he should be an important noble, and he \*was\* an important noble.  Everything was hunky-dory.
2. As soon as Rand starts doing Dragon Reborn things and the Tower splits, Gawyn's self-image is no longer consistent with his ideal self.  He's programmed to think of himself as one of the continent's most important people, the elite of the elite.  Reality is suddenly different.  He's not even close to being First Prince, rather he's just the leader of a ragtag band of semi traitors.  What prestige does a noble have when entire kingdoms and their rulers are currying favor with the Dragon Reborn?  He's known Elaida his whole life and helped her attain the Amyrlin Seat, but she couldn't give two shits about him.  He was a first-string quarterback and now he's relegated to third-string waterboy.
3. Gawyn becomes deeply insecure, which is the underlying cause for his irrational and envious behavior.  Back in Cairhien when Egwene got sucked into Gawyn's dream, she noticed that his self-image was different from reality.  He thought of himself as shorter, uglier, and all around not as cool as other people saw him as.  Even after he learns Egwene loves him, this insecurity never goes away.
4. I don't think he really believed, in his heart of hearts, that Rand actually killed his mother.  Not after everyone, even Bryne, told him differently.  I think he kept repeating that to himself because he \*needed a reason to hate Rand\*.  It's all about that insecurity.  When they first met, Rand was a nobody from nowhere while Gawyn was a bigshot.  Gawyn turned into a scrub who doesn't matter on the world stage, while Rand became the most important figure in the world.  Gawyn's sister loves him, his mentor/arguable father figure Bryne calls him Andor's savior, the love of his life has a nebulous childhood connection with him and keeps telling him how Rand is really a good man.  If you are Gawyn, and you think yourself shorter, uglier, than you really are, and you can barely believe your super-amazing girlfriend even likes you to begin with, what kind of ugly jealousy is going to rear its head when you start to ponder on her past relationship with Rand?
5. He consoles himself by thinking that everything will be alright once he finally reunites with his true love.  At least he can play the dashing hero with her, right?  But events don't play out that way at all.  Even after he reunites with Egwene and "saves" her, he \*still\* doesn't regain any sort of importance.  She's become the Amyrlin Seat after all.  He's reduced to following her around like a spurned hound, trying to prove his importance to at least her if no one else.  His self esteem takes another gigantic blow.  And that eventually leads to his ultimate mistake in the last book.

Gawyn's jealousy and indecisiveness stem from his insecurity, which stems from him losing his place in the world.  He's \*not\* important any longer, and he's \*not\* really relevant to world events any longer, and everyone else seems to \*just love\* this jumped up \*peasant\* Rand al'Thor.

Gawyn, while on the side of the Light, is not what I would call a "good" man.  But he is a very realistic character, when compared to basically every main character.  It makes it easy to hate him, because all the other characters are larger-than-life, self-sacrificing, amazing people.  Gawyn is the stereotyped middle manager who saw themselves doing great things but was forced to wallow in mediocrity.

So I just finished the Wheel of Time series, and that ending was NOT what I expected. I'm not saying it was bad by any means, it was definitely unexpected in a good way.  I got halfway through the chapter of the Last Battle, and figured it would end with some weird compromise or Rand just resealing the Bore.

I was very happy with how it turned out.


But now I am lost and adrift.  I have my next book, but it feels weird that it is not a WoT book, since my last 13 "next books" have been.

The Dragonbone Chair - a few thoughts. So I just finished this one (Book 1 in **Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn** series by Tad Williams), and wanted to share a few thoughts on it - not a big official review, but some things that stood out.

Let's get a few of my negatives out of the way first:

* The beginning of the book is slow, and then even after it begins to 'pick up', there are still **pacing issues**. I wasn't overly bothered by it, but I can definitely see how it could be a barrier to some readers. It's hard for me to think of too many other books I have read (other than maybe some by  Robin Hobb) that have started this slowly - though still confidently.
* **The world-building is not always clear**. There are a lot of names in this book, and they don't always click super easily. It took me a while (and frankly, I'm still not totally clear) to get my head around some of these names, places, and history. I would have loved for there to be a solid Wiki like you find for ASOIAF, Malazan, WoT, etc.

Now let's talk about where the book succeeds, IMO:

* **The writing.** My god, the writing. I feel like I've never really heard /read anyone discuss Tad William's prose before, but dear lord does he deserve to be in the same category as Hobb, Rothfuss, GGK, and the other wordsmiths in Fantasy. His skill in prose and description is honestly what kept me going, even when the pacing was a bit too slow. Just an absolute joy to read, while still being totally approachable for readers of all ages.
* **The characters** also stand out, particularly Simon. I can see why some readers might be annoyed by him, but I really grew to love him - even more than comparable characters like FitzChivalry Farseer or Kvothe. I loved how fallible he was, but also how he perseveres and grows. He's so earnest that's it's impossible *not* to love him, IMO. I enjoyed many of the side characters as well - Marya, Binabak, Josua, etc.
* The **lore and history**, while confusing at times, was still very well thought out and had me yearning to learn more. I love that it feels almost like it's ripped out of our history - there are even hints of a Christianity-like religion. It just feels like there is a lot more to be learned below the surface, which I really love.

Overall, this was a great read - particularly when you look at in the context of when it came out, preceding Wheel of Time, ASOIAF, Realm of the Elderlings, and other modern Fantasy giants. It feels almost like the beginning of modern Fantasy, in many ways. Definitely worth your time, and highly recommended. I can't wait to start **The Stone of Farewel**l!

Looking for fantasy symbols for a tattoo  Throughout my life, fantasy was the thing that got me into other things: games (WoW, Warcraft, Diablo, Sacred, D &amp; D, etc.), books (WoT, Sanderson, First Law, KingKiller Chronicles, etc.), friends.

So i was thinking to make a tatto that represent fantasy itself, but i I have run out of ideas. Dragons, horses and magic are the three things which i consider to be the "symbols" of fantasy.

I know that a tattoo is something very personal but I want to see what you guys, also fans of the genre, have in mind outside of these three symbols.

My idea was something that might tell a story when tyou look at it. It also can be about the games and books that i mentioned before.

I already thought about a dragon riding a horse with a staff in its claws.

First read through finished! (I know I'm late to the party) Just finished my first read through of WoT! I loved the ending mostly, but damn, had some waterworks going as so many characters died or appeared to die at the end.

&gt;I have to say the biggest unexpected twist was Verin. I was rather suspicious of her, but also liked her, through the entire series, and her ending was heart rending.&lt;

Awful case of indecision I wrote a story. I built this high fantasy world for it, I felt it had a unique touch and a unique setting and it wasn't derivative of anything I'd ever read (obviously fantasy is inherently derivative but I hope you get my point).

It hasn't aged very well, in my own opinion. I started writing it at age 17-18 I think, and I had it "finished" (I don't consider it finished, not really) at about age 25-26. I'm 30 now and I don't know what to do... I feel like it inhibits me from writing. I want to pass this kidney stone of a story, to be rid of it, to be free. I have all the words written out (about 150k) but it is in dire need of editing. The thing is, it's not the editing in itself that is daunting. The real issue here is that I just don't know where to go with a couple of things in the story. This indecision is basically killing me creatively.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a part of me that just wants to delete all of it. I'm not going to, but it's tempting sometimes. The biggest issue with the novel is that the main characters are very, very strong. It's the kind of "they don't know how strong they really are and have no real control over it most of the time"-strong, which I at the time felt was really cool. It's very much WoT-inspired, where the main characters have these awesome abilities which grow over time. This kind of kills the suspense, and this is obviously my fault. I just don't know how to fix this without rewriting all of it. When I think about rewriting it from scratch, it just makes my head hurt and I go do something else.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been starting a project where I've re-invented the whole world in which this book is set, in order to revitalize my creativity for the book but I'm stuck there, too. Same issue here, really. Indecision over how to create the world. I've been getting really into real world history lately, which makes me scared to create a world which isn't "realistic" enough. Silly me. I'm going in circles, and instead of actually writing I'm posting here.

The best part of all of this, is that the book I've written is intended to have a sequel which ties up the main plot. Yes, you read that right. I have an entire sequel outlined in my head, which I can't get to writing since the house of cards which it builds upon is just too weak to stand on its own. I genuinely think the plot of these books is great. I mean that, and I'm very self-critical. It just doesn't fly and I don't know how to fix it, and I can't give you any text to read or anything because it's in Swedish.

This is driving me nuts. I've just now decided to start reading it again, from the beginning. Maybe I can salvage this...

A Conan game based on a Robert Jordan Conan novel (I think) Jordan wrote a book called Conan the Unconquered that was first published in 1983.

Personally I loved the Conan stories Jordan created. You can see and feel his writing style from WoT in them and he always managed to fashion something interesting with the lore and world Howard built.

What do you think of the Conan novels written by Jordan?

(No Spoilers) Gardens of the Moon VERSUS Deadhouse Gates I haven't read any of these books, but I just ordered both online. I also hear they follow entirely different characters\arcs, so I wonder which one is more recommended to read first? Which is a better book? Which would ease a reader better into the Malazan world? (I hear it's a hard series, but I love WoT and ASoIaF, so this sounds right up my alley!)
Just make your case for which book to read first between the two in the title, and maybe anything else I should know, but no spoilers, please!

New to Malazan - What can I expect? I am somewhat new to fantasy, mostly after reading ASOIAF (although it fell off quite a bit after AFFC, in my opinion). I became a bit obsessed and have been looking for something similar - I loved the complex, dimensional characters and the vastness of world and its history. I basically have a new-found respect for anybody that has an imagination to create something so complex and well written.

I read the Mistborn trilogy as well but it wasn’t quite what I was looking for, although I did enjoy.

I started WOT but could not get passed the first book - I’m not a big fan of good vs evil and it reminded me a lot of LoTR (also not a big fan of).

So I’ve heard so much about Malazan and I’m very excited to start this series. I’m hoping it’s everything I’ve been waiting for! So my question is, what can I expect? (No spoilers please!)

One of my favourite scenes so far [LoC Spoiler] Reading WoT for the first time and I've just read the scene where Nynaeve heals Logain, Siuan and Leane. OMG, Robert Jordan almost made me feel as if I was in the room. I could feel the joy in Siuan's face as soon as her tears appeared in her cheeks. I didn't like Nynaeve so much in the first books, but now she is one of my favourites and this scene just made her even better. Gosh I love this series

What is your favorite 10+ Book series? Of course I know about famous ones like WOT, Malazan and Stormlight, but I was wondering if there were more series like these that I hadn't heard of.

Personally, ive only read series that connect to other series, making it 10+ books together, like Percy Jackson.

I would love to hear what you guys know about, as well as your thoughts on the book series being so long.

Spoiler heavy post: Damn Wikipedia to Hell WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD:
I just started listening to the first WoT Audiobook and used Wikipedia after maybe half the book to give me a summary of the character and the plot.

The reason I did that is that English is not my first language so a lot of the vocab and sayings that might be common in 80's fantasy writing are either lost on me or require full attention to follow along. I was sometimes distracted while listening and had a hard time remembering the origins and motives of all of the characters.

So anyways, while reading the first lines of the the plot summary of the first book on Wikipedia I clicked on the Name of Egwene al'Vere because I wanted to know who of the village girls she was exactly.
Wikipedia send me straight to an article with all of the WoT characters and there where only three sentences written about her on of which was that

SPOILER:
She dies during the last battle

Fucking thanks Wikipedia, that's so stupid.

By the time I'm writing this I'm close to finishing the first book and really grew attached to all the characters and it pisses me of to no end that I now  know that one of the main protagonists dies in the final book just because I was confused in the beginning of the first book and wanted a recap of the first part.

Anyways now I'll guess I'll avoid any kind of recaps, if I'll ever get confused again I guess I just listen stuff multiple times until I figured out everything

Just finished Kingskiller, LoTR, Ice and Fire. What now? Mistborn, WoT or Malazan? I am very new to Fantasy reading and it is definitely something I enjoy and I want to make a permanent and constant thing in my life. My favorite (and most recent) is Kingskiller Chronicles.  I don't really know what I like to read, but I do like a bit scary stuff (thrilling and horror). So now that I have to choose a new series to start I am in doubt between those 3. What should I start now and why? Maybe something else? Thanks in advance.

So I check back: ok I need Lord of Chaos. I go to my tote full of WoT books and... It's.... Not... There!!?

Am I the only one actually WANTS the R-rated version of WoT? I've seen several posts and posters talk about how they're hoping for a PG-13 version of the series, and each time I just think please no! I'm actually hoping they double down on the adult themes in the series. I have a few reasons:

1. Sex and violence are intrinsic parts of several of the series' major themes. Dumai's Wells will probably be the biggest example of the necessity of violence. Without it being presented in a frank and graphic manner, it could easily turn into "look how cool the Asha'man are" instead of the shocking horror it's intended to be. On the line between sex and violence, sexual violence plays a major part of several characters' arcs (most prominently, Morgase and the Whitecloaks). And on the more positive side of things, sex plays a normal and healthy part of most characters' developing relationships. I'm not saying we need GoT sexposition, but sex can also be a critical turning point in a relationship (I'm thinking of Rand and Aviendha, for one).
2. Gore and sex serve as audience dividers, today. A PG-13 (or T) rating frequently means a show is being positioned towards teens and kids. The rating can act as a ceiling for what the show can depict, not just in terms of blood and nudity, but in terms of thematic complexity (and yes, there are exceptions). I find it difficult to believe that a teen-targeted version would do justice to the decline of the Aiel, Rand's internal struggles, or the dissonance within the Seanchan. The Wheel of Time, more than many series, is about the absolute devastation wrought by even the most righteous of wars, and I think that having to keep the kids who might be watching in mind would make showing this more difficult.
3. Sex and violence can make good tv! They can make for exciting scenes, especially when in service of the story. They're storytelling devices like any others. Plus, if you don't want to see sex or violence, you can always just skip that part.

Of course, you may disagree. You may think the show should be aimed at teens; you may have an idea for a more effective communication of the thematically-important sex and violence in the story than visually-explicit scenes; or you may think that those parts are actually not important to the story, and that they would take time away from other, more important elements. Then again, maybe you just think sex and violence on tv is icky (but maybe be upfront about that?).

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? Where do you fall on this? Are there other factors I'm just not considering?

Jordan, Vietnam, and teenaged soldiers (spoilers through book 6). It's well known that Robert Jordan served two tours of duty in Vietnam.  I was thinking about this as I've been rereading the series, and I'm now in the middle of book six.  The main male characters have been torn from their homes, taken to foreign countries with strange customs, killed people for the first time, watched friends die for the first time, and had sex for the first time.

They are now in positions of authority with older men following their direction.  They have awesome killing power, but then so do their enemies.  There's still a lot they don't know about the enemy and there are also many allies they don't trust.  The enemy can pop up anywhere, not just on the front lines, and the enemy has friends among the allies.

The injection of women with magical powers is very different from Vietnam, but adds to the challenges for the men.  Can they trust the women they meet?  Can they trust the women who want to seduce them?

For Rand, Mat, and Perrin, I'm seeing a lot of parallels to young men serving tours of duty in Vietnam in the 1960s.  For the women it's a little different, but the very different roles for men and women reflects the 1960s, when men were subject to the draft and women were not.  And, in a sense, the women who go to war in WoT are volunteers, while Rand, Mat, and Perrin have no choice.

I just thought it was interesting to think of parallels with Jordan's own likely experiences in Vietnam.

She Dazzles My Eyes and Clouds My Mind I'm loving the banter of the posts here regarding the potential cast of the Amazon series. But once the cast is set, I fear that I won't be able to read the series without my original images of the WoT characters, places and artifacts being  altered.

On my first read, I had sculpted the images of these things and they have been etched into my mind.  Through the years, my understanding has grown and the images have reflected that growth. (BTW I've never used the original cover art to shape my imagination)

For instance, Moiraine was described in pretty good detail in tEotW, so my minds image began to picture her like the actress on the left. But as my understanding of the Cairhienin people grew, she now could look like the actress on the right.

In one respect I'm excited because there are some very creative people out there working on this project and can do a whole lot better job than I giving us a visual representation of this story we love.

&amp;#x200B;

How much weight do you think the portrayal in the books will be used in the Amazon series? Do you think casting will be decided on best fit or best chops?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, stream of consciousness over...

[no spoilers] Encourage people to watch the show When the WOT tv show is released we won’t want it to get lost on Amazon.  I have several friends who won’t commit the time to reading the books, but say they will watch the show.  So all of us should encourage friends to watch, even if they haven’t read.  This will help keep the show running and with improved ratings it will get the show more funding.

What to read next? I'd been stuck on reading the last Malazan book for quite a while for several reasons. I've finished it now but I'm feeling kinda lost on what to go for next.

Ive read a lot of long series, LoR, Hobbit, WoT, SoIaF, Mistborn, Stormlight Archive, Night Angel trilogy, Lies of Locke Lamora, Lightbringer, Faithful and the Fallen , Demon Cycle, Codex Alera, Red Knight, Raven's Shadow, Kingkiller, First Law, and a bunch more that I can't remember quite now.

The only ones that I didn't like is the Farseer tribology, there were just too many moments where I felt everything was done wrong so I didn't contuine there and the Riftwar Cycle.

There are a few books that I've somewhere on my list, mostly from Mark Lawrence and Mark J Sullivan, that are somewhere on the to read list but didn't quite convince me so they're not on the top yet.

Ive seen some recommendations over the time but hardly picked up on them so if you have books that you really enjoyed if well known or not at all (or if you're the author and want to start me on your own book) let me know and I'll go check the book out, read the kindle sample and decide then.

After 19 years, I finally finished the WoT series... Felt I needed to bring this news to a place where it would be better received after my husband's lackluster reaction to the news that I, after 19 years, JUST FINISHED THE WoT SERIES!

This series was a huge part of my adolescence. I first started it when I was twelve, thanks to my English teacher who took pity on my awkward recess lurking and gifted me The Eye of the World so I didn't look so odd sitting around. I was hooked. I can probably blame the multitude of eye issues I have on reading these books by moonlight after my parents told me to go to bed (these kids with Kindles/iPads have it so easy nowadays...). I inhaled them, throwing all of my babysitting monies at Barnes and Noble to get my paws on the next book. I even embraced my full nerd and joined an online RPG based on the series, I'm struggling to remember the site, but I think it was something like whitetower . net? Nine books later, I was dragging my mother to our local bookstore for a meet and greet with Robert Jordan about his (then) latest release: Crossroads of Twilight. I remember we waited for hours to meet him, my mother chiding me about having my questions ready for him, and when we finally got up to the front, I was totally speechless and mutely handed him my book to sign. I have it safely tucked away on a bookshelf where no one will touch it to this day.

I had a falling out with the series around the same time I left for college and only made it through half of Knife of Dreams. Which, in retrospect, would have happened anyways with the span of time between KoD and tGS. I remember learning of Robert Jordan's death while studying at the library and being stricken by the news, I was so hoping his battle was going to be won. I couldn't imagine what it felt like for him, to put so much time and heart into this series and not be able to see it through. I actually cried the day I found out, the series and it's author still meant so much to me all those years and college beers later. I never did outgrow it.

Once I graduated and put on big girl pants, I decided to start the series again, vowing to finish it this time around. I failed; I got distracted somewhere between The Gathering Storm and Towers of Midnight and cheated with another series. Actually, with countless other series. So many other characters and plots, I lost track... That is one thing I learned about me and the WoT: we have to be monogamous. There is only room for this one series up there (ok, maybe an audiobook on the side... I have problems!), and the longer the spans between reading or any other series I had going, the more I forgot. Next time I'd stay focused.

So with lessons learned and a vow to be (kind of) devoted, I started up with EotW again this past fall... and today marks that fateful day when I sadly shut the cover on A Memory of Light. I'm excited, I'm sad, I'm thrilled to put all of the pieces together... but mostly I feel a little lost. What a weird mix of emotions! Bears to mind a familiar quote, no?

# “There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending.”

Outlander really an antidote for ASoIaF ? (Spoilers) Is Outlander really worth reading? I enjoyed ASoIaF, WoT, and reading third book of Farseer Trilogy now. Most of my lady friends have recommended Outlander and they even say that it is better than ASoIaF. While a couple of guys said that it's basically an erotica and the protagonist rapes his friend. Is it investing a time? I don't mind erotica or something if I enjoy the experience. I want to know the experiences of men who read this. Would you recommend this to your friends ?

Which supporting characters are you most excited to see developed more on the show? I'm up to Lords of Chaos right now in my first read-through of the series (WoT deserves so much more recognition than ASOIAF in my opinion) and so far my most anticipated supporting characters for the show are:

- Thom
- Loial (I've heard people speculate that they might cut him and just the whole Ogier race from the show entirely which would be so depressing)
- Logain
- Galad
- Gawyn (he's so misunderstood as a character)

Basic recommendation post So I'm desperately looking for a new series to get stuck into while I patiently wait for Joe Abercrombie's next book. I've read pretty much all you'd expect, WoT, ASOIAF, LOTR, KKC, all Sanderson, Gentlemen Bastards, Broken Empire etc. and I feel I've read all the best stuff. Anything would work, but I'd specifically like something along the lines of First Law or Gentlemen Bastards, kinds following regular shitty people but magic exists in the background. Thanks very much in advance!

So...something the opposite of First Law? I loved the recommendation from here for First Law btw. Great series, although i was a bit disappointed with Ferro's ending (all the rest were great).

I then picked up "Best Served Cold," and got through the first couple chapters when i realized I don't need any more existential absurdity of life stuff right now.

After coming off that and Brent Weeks, I think I need something a bit lighter. Something like Stormlight or Lightbringer.

Any recommendations? I liked First Law's return to the trilogy format. Not sure I have 11 book epicness in me right now.

I've heard good things about Powder Mage, and have read Got, WoT, Malazan, Night Angel, Lightbringer, First Law, and Stormlight.

I think the WOT show should be animated After reading through all my physical books I've listened to the whole series twice on audible. I personally think that WOT could only be done justice if animated. I don't think the intensity of some scenes and the beauty of the one power can be done with B or C list actors and half-decent CGI. This is something of an idea I had for the animation style. (next sentence is spoilers) &gt;!One of my favorite scenes was the fall of Caemly and the last stand with the Dragons. I just don't know how they will manage an entire city in flames with hundreds of thousands of trollocks!&lt;.

Other options I’m currently going through the WOT series.. Almost done with Lord Of Chaos and I find myself struggeling reading it. Not that it is too hard, but I think I need to read something else for a while. I haven’t been reading for ages until I picked up WOT. Is it possible that I just need a change? Do you guys can recommend other WOT like books? Still have The Witcher books and Dwarves laying around too.. So I’m glad to hear your ideas. Thx!

The Role of Women in WoT So I just finished the audiobook for Eye of the World for the first time (which was terrific btw) and near the end I got to thinking: Now that the series has been finished for a while (and the beginning close to 30 years old), how does Robert Jordan's treatment of female characters shake out? Having read the whole series, I know how crucial women are to Rand as advisors, and necessary allies, but also can be caught up in emotions and braid-tugging and whatnot. Full disclosure, I'm a 20-something white guy so that has surely influenced my perspective. Regardless, here are some thoughts in a non-exhaustive list:

&amp;#x200B;

Hey That Seems Progressive:

* The Women's Circle really has more power in Emond's Field than the Village Council does
* Some of the countries are outright matriarchal (i.e. Andor always having a queen)
* Only female Aes Sedai (in the current age)
* Far Dareis Mai
* Strong female characters (Moiraine, Nynaeve, Egwene, etc.)
* Women are crucial to most of the plot
* Male and female halves of the True Source are balanced and cannot be touched by the other

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, Hold on There, What was that?

* All of the braid-tugging, etc.
* Well the Aes Sedai are all women, but they're actually all witches/darkfriends
* Every time a man protects a women because he thinks he's doing her a favor
* Rand's Love Quadrangle (seriously though wtf)
* All women are constantly emotional
* Rand's overwhelming need to protect women (especially after killing the one woman)

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that Jordan's world has a much more balanced role for women on the whole than many other fantasy worlds. Jordan's world is so vast that many countries and societies are incredibly matriarchal, while others are more traditionally patriarchal. Some of his male characters feel the overwhelming need to protect their female compatriots, even if they are easily able to take care of themselves. Some of Jordan's strongest characters are female, and he does not spare either sex from strengths and flaws alike. Although I am not as sure of this, as I remember it Jordan seems to stay away from the over sexualized description of female bodies as seen through the male gaze, preferring instead to focus on facial features and body language. I am very curious to see how other people have viewed his writing and approach towards female characters and will try to keep an open mind through all of this! I am more than happy to be proven completely wrong!

Sword of Truth by Terry Goodkind I read WoT, ASOIAF and  currently reading the third book of  Farseer Trilogy. I have heard some  things about Sword of Truth and a friend of mine is a huge fan of that series. He goes on praising and praising about the series. Is it really that good, I mean there are nearly 20 books and it's such a huge investment of time. I want to know the opinions of the people who read it.

Just finished WoT, looking for a new epic series So as the title says, just got done reading Wheel of Time (top 3 book series for me), and need something new to scratch that fantasy itch.

For a background, I LOVE magic systems, I read lots of books set in sort of medieval times(swords and bows) but still enjoy other time periods, and the cliche tale of “chosen one” or coming of age is my favorite story line.

Other series I’ve read:
Practically everything from Brandon Sanderson, Kingkiller, Night Angels, Lightbringer, Ryria, Fitz and the Fool, Dresden, Gentleman Bastard’s, Codex Alera, Broken Empire, Ravens Shadow, The Shadow Campaign, and more but these are the top series I loved (no particular order)

Always open to expanding my horizons as well if you have a book you’ve been dying to suggest!

Wheel of time few question before i start reading. So after i asked on Malazan reddit they told me its series that is harder to read with a LOT of characters and informations that nobody will explain and readers are mostly confused after first book because how complicated it is. Wont read it for now. Time for another huge series.

So is WoT overcomplicated to read compared to Malazan?

Read prequel first or after? It is necessary/worth?

Short version about MC and the story?

Something i need to do before reading?

What rating will the WoT TV series most likely have? (PG,M,MA?) I was just wondering what you guys think the rating of the tv series will be when it comes out. I'm hoping they go for a more adult feel which i think is likely because any fantasy series being adapted to tv will try and be the new Game of Thrones.

MoI So after DG, one of my favorite books, I started with MoI with great enthusiasm. After 5-6 chapters, I couldn't go any further. MoI had one of the greatest prologues, and the story was super fast paced; but I could barely handle the amount of information rushed in that small window of time. Burn being poisoned, the crippled God (so much about him) and his origin, the Elder gods, and most importantly, Silverfox giving ALL that information about the Deck of Dragons. I felt it was a lot to take in, and needed something less burdening, a palate cleanser.  Hence, I wanted to read Tales of Bauchelain but I'm not able to get my hands on a copy where I live. So I'm thinking of LotR or WoT? Don't get me wrong, I definitely would love to see Onearm and Brood fight on the same team for once, but I don't think I can right now. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one facing this problem. LotR seems like a linear read and I'd read Fellowship of the Ring 7-8 years ago .  So, what say?

Press Releases and Chicken Little ####I bet you really like The Wheel of Time. (You're reading a post on r/WoT, which is a pretty good sign.)

I also bet that at some point, you've wanted to hype it up to someone you think would really like it, too.

Or, maybe a a friend heard about the upcoming show and asked you, "So what's the deal with this series?"

Maybe a concerned family member or partner finally inquired in disbelief about how you just keep reading thousands of pages of Tor-brand doorstopper.

&amp;nbsp;

####Press Releases

On October 2, 2018, Sony Pictures posted their [press release](https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2018/10_18/100218_AmazonStudios.html) announcing that Amazon is greenlighting the Wheel of Time series. Most of us got the official news from social media via [News](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/wheel-time-fantasy-drama-nabs-amazon-series-order-1148488) [Sources](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/amazon-studios-the-wheel-of-time-robert-jordan-1202964895/), or right from [Tor](https://www.tor.com/2018/10/02/wheel-of-time-picked-up-by-amazon-first-season-to-focus-on-moiraine/).

Googling around, it takes longer than you'd expect to find the text of the original release from Sony. The reason for this has to do with the nature of press releases. A publicity writer creating a press release isn't aiming for general readership. (Practically nobody sits around checking the official word from Sony every day, so no news would get out that way!) Instead, the intended audience is small: Press releases are for journalists and media creators, who make it their literal business to attract as much readership as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwynne/2016/06/13/how-to-write-a-press-release/#295dc9773b93) says: "Press releases are not features. They are not informal pitches.  They are formal, official announcements regarding something new or significant..." The media are invited to take this official word (not yet reading material) and synthesize it into an article, a social media post, or whatever they're good at getting people to see. The release itself is raw hype and information for writers to harvest: Catchy hook, Quick &amp; thorough summary, and some boilerplate. If you compare the [original](https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2018/10_18/100218_AmazonStudios.html) side-by-side with the articles in [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/wheel-time-fantasy-drama-nabs-amazon-series-order-1148488), [Variety](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/amazon-studios-the-wheel-of-time-robert-jordan-1202964895/), and [Tor](https://www.tor.com/2018/10/02/wheel-of-time-picked-up-by-amazon-first-season-to-focus-on-moiraine/), you'll see the wording is *almost* the same, but usually smoothed into more continuous writing.

####The #1 goal of the press release, exclusive above all other purposes, is to say to the media, *I am the most exciting thing you can possibly write about.*

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I go into this is to give some context to **how** we know the few facts we know so far. Among the quotes and miscellanea, the meat of the press release for WoT fans is this infamous paragraph:
&gt;The Wheel of Time is set in a sprawling, epic world where magic exists, but only women can use it. Meaning that in this series — women hold the keys to power. The story follows Moiraine, a member of the shadowy and influential all-female organization called the ‘Aes Sedai’ as she embarks on a dangerous, world-spanning journey with five young men and women. Moiraine’s interested in these five because she believes one of them might be the reincarnation of an incredibly powerful individual, whom prophecies say will either save humanity or destroy it. The series draws on numerous elements of European and Asian culture and philosophy, most notably the cyclical nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism.

&amp;nbsp;

####What point am I getting to?

I've noticed a lot of Chicken Little behavior on this sub (and elsewhere) based on this paragraph, or on reworkings of this paragraph. That is to say, there's been a lot of speculation that the sky is falling, and I think we all need to chill.

&amp;nbsp;


~~~

&amp;nbsp;

####"Women hold the keys to power"

The most common panic I've seen is about the "only women can use magic" statement. Whether it's conservatism about adaptation "accuracy" or a bit of veiled (and less than veiled) misogyny, the alarmed consensus seems to be that the writers must be fundamentally screwing with RJ's lore because the press release says women are important. Without even *starting* to address these worries relative to the books, it's worth noting that the original release *immediately* and explicitly clarifies: "women hold the keys to power". This is a much more technically accurate description of the situation, but **press releases are about intrigue first**. You'll notice that none of the articles chose to incorporate the line that only serves to clarify lore.

&amp;nbsp;

The equally major dread is that the three ultra-Ta'veren kids -- one of whom is the godlike savior of the literal universe -- will somehow be pushed to the background because "the story follows Moiraine." Here I will quibble with you per the books, because Moiraine inciting the action is essential to *The Eye of the World*, and that is unequivocal. To argue that her initial perspective is less appropriate than Rand's, just because we're used to Rand and know he's important, flies in the face of the way Jordan approached storytelling. When you're explaining WoT to someone, multiple POVs is key in the elevator pitch. And that's what we're seeing here in a press release. A formalized elevator pitch.

&amp;nbsp;

~~~

&amp;nbsp;

####tl;dr = Be smart, honest, and patient

In this day and age, there is an incredibly fluid dialogue developing between fans and the creators of media we love. This makes us want the press release to be more meaningful than it is. **We're not reading a detailed creative proposal, nor a fun winking tidbit from the show's writers to their knowing fans. We're reading a studio's best attempt to make this show sound interesting to people who may never have heard of it.** Like I said at the beginning, you can obviously sympathize with the crazy challenge of selling The Wheel of Time in a few sentences. This hook is not for us. **Be smart.**

&amp;nbsp;

All the jaded parading of "If you expect it to be bad, you'll never be disappointed" and "Speculative negative opinions can't affect anything" is crap. If disappointment from a TV show sneaks up on you that badly, you probably haven't been honest with yourself. There's a healthy, critically-minded middle ground between "It's going to be 100% accurate and 100% good" and "It's going to be 0% accurate and 0% good. **Be honest.**

&amp;nbsp;

We have to consider something when deciding whether to write or draw attention to another *'Let's agonize over the tiny amount of information we have'* post:

The new fanbase who haven't read the books will read and give weight to the opinions of WoT readers. Baseless speculation this far ahead will make everyone (especially non-readers seeking predictions) hyper-sensitized to a vague *"Should we reject this?"* feeling rather than allowing everyone to respond to the TV show they *do* end up making.

By the time the show comes out, the negative hype cycle will have ramped up, and nobody will be prepared to be generous with the show about the things (however many or few) that are actually good. It has happened before. Speculative pre-release negative hype can do real damage to otherwise fine media. Amazon may pull the plug, and there will be no room for this nowadays endangered thing called *gradual improvement.* The showrunner and writers seem to care a TON about the books, and also about what the fans want. **Be patient.**

Almost out of Sanderson Material... What do I read next? After finishing Skyward (which I thoroughly enjoyed) I’ve read everything Sanderson has written except for Rithmatist and Alcatraz.   I’ve been hooked on this author since I discovered him when he finished the WoT series but for some reason have overlooked these books.  Are these as enjoyable as the rest of his books?  My alternative is Dune at this point which I’ve also never read.

A general comment about thinking in WoT. One reason WoT may seem slow to people is that the characters spend a *lot* of time thinking.  And yet, I will miss that in the TV series.  I will miss Nynaeve working herself up to being mad, Rand arguing with Lews Therin (they have to show that somehow, right?), Perrin smelling what everyone is feeling and puzzling over what to do about it, even Aviendha puzzling over Wetlanders.  So much of this series happens in the minds of the point of view characters.  I'll miss Padan Fain thinking vile thoughts, too, including the revelation that he warped the thoughts of Elaida and Pedron Naill.  I'll miss Elaida's grandiose fantasies about ruling the world.  A lot of Jordan's humor is contained in those inner thoughts that the characters try to hide from each other, but also important plot points.  I'm not saying the TV series will be bad, but it will be different without all those private reflections.

Lengthy thoughts after first reread in a while I've been a big fan of WoT since the early 90s (not sure if I started before tGH came out or after), and I just reread (most of) it for the first time since aMoL came out. So, some thoughts...

&amp;#x200B;

**Good Things**

\-Worldbuilding. Probably the single greatest strength of the series is the incredibly complex world it creates, with so many different nations and cultures and artifacts, with thousands of years of history, with pop culture (Jain Farstrider!), with tons of interesting and diverse groups (Ogiers! Aiel! Whitecloaks!). And in particular, I love the magic system. There are so many well-thought-out details such as channelers shielding each other which just seem so \_right\_.

\-Evocative language. I'm normally more of a plot-and-action kind of guy, but there's some absolutely wonderful phraseology, particularly when it comes to some of the prophecies/histories/etc. "The grave is no bar to my call". That's not a very complicated sentiment, and yet it is expressed so perfectly.

\-Ta'veren. One of the cleverest things RJ did was come up with the idea of Ta'veren, which, if you look at it from a certain angle, just means "this is a main character". It allows all sorts of the random coincidences and improbabilities that make for good storytelling but poor realism to occur, and it's woven enough into the fabric of the series that it certainly does not feel like something thrown in at the last minute. (Flip side of that, however, is that some of the other characters are not officially Ta'veren, and yet have equally improbable arcs... Egwene in particular. How many lost skills did she recover? How did she become Amyrlin at such a young age? How did she survive so many ridiculous situations? I almost expected there to be some revelation at the end that only men could be Ta'veren, but there was an equivalent thing for women, which Egwene and Nyn and Elayne all were, or something like that, to help explain it.)

\-Clever and sensible plot twists and solutions, particularly involving magic. I think my favorite is when Nyn captures Mog with an A'dam in the world of dreams. Totally consistent with the rules we were told, and yet I sure has heck didn't see it coming the first time.

\-POVs of unsympathetic characters. Many cases where we learn why people we really dislike are the way they are. And it makes sense. Most of the "bad guys" aren't unmitigated sociopathic evil, they're the way they are due to some justification, some situation, some circumstance. Something I really liked this read-through was the handling of the whitecloaks. They're generally "bad", and yet each of the various captains we meet is a distinct individual with distinct motivations, and there's at least hope at the end that Galad will whip them into shape.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of my favorite scenes/arcs**

\-The history of the Aiel revealed at Rhuidean (as seems to be near-universal)

\-Egwene as captive in the WT. Strains plausibility that Elaida would actually treat her that way, but SO satisfying to read

\-Tuon and Matt's interactions

\-Every time the Horn is blown

\-My very favorite scene is when Elayne/Nyn/Egwene are captured by bandits of some sort who are going to sell them to myrdraals, and then a bunch of Aiel crash through the window and start drumming their drums to get the mydraal to dance with them. SO bad ass.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bad things/criticisms**

\-I got awfully sick of men talking about how to manipulate women and women talking about how to manipulate men. Blah blah blah. In fact, most of the romance falls a bit flat, for me. And at the end everyone is paired off nicely, thom and moiraine, galad and berelain, etc. Yawn.

\-The overall pacing of the series. I'm sure this has been beaten to death, but I certainly think that there is a big lag between books 6 and 10. Not only do things slow waaaay down, but there's also a ton of stuff introduced that just pushed my brain's ability to track. There are only so many characters who I can really track and remember and care about. And for me, that includes none of the seafolk, almost none of the black tower (which one's Grady? which one's Flynn? which one's Narishma?), no one involved in Elayne's interminable politicking and succession fights (probably the very worst storyline, overall). That not only makes reading them tedious, it also takes away from the impact of various plot twists and revelations. When we learn that Verin was BA? AMAZING. When we learn which one of 5 fairly indistinguishable AS hanging around with Elayne was BA and she killed Adelaes or Vandene? Yawn. I've already forgotten which one it was.

\-Way too much plot armor for non-Ta'veren characters (on both sides), particularly involving (a) people escaping from captivity and (b) people getting knocked unconscious rather than killed. For example: Moiraine and Lan try to attack Aginor at the end of EotW, he blasts them with full Forsaken power... and knocks them both unconscious. Good thing his channeling was set on stun! Then near the beginning of tGH, Padan Fain escapes, and leaves Egwene and Matt (I think?) unconscious in the dungeon. This was so jarring that I thought to myself "huh, I bet there's some reason for this that I've just forgotten, I'll keep reading and see what it is", and there never was (unless I missed it?). As for people escaping, how many times are the good guys going to capture some BA or a Forsaken and just have three sisters sitting outside their door maintaining a shield and just assume things will work out. Come on! Even ignoring the frustratingly obvious "still them and then heal them again so they're weaker" plan, if you capture Semirhage, you don't leave her off in a room somewhere with a few sisters maintaining a shield. No, you put her in a cage in the middle of a well lit field, with 5 different groups of AS all shielding her at the same time, surrounded by warders and Aiel, all visible to each other, etc, etc. (Related to this is the ridiculous idea that three accepted, even very strong accepted, are going to catch thirteen full sister BAs. And of course, they don't, and it's mainly due to plot armor that they don't end up dead/stilled/compelled/turned.) This is particularly frustrating because frequently the characters \_are\_ smarter than that, and they they just have these idiotic blind spots.

\-I don't think it makes much sense for the BA to be as big and successful as they are, without actually accomplishing more. They must have been something like 20% of the tower population? And yet they never bothered to steal any angreal/sa'angreal. They never bothered to kill any of the good guys who were novices. They get Alviarin and Sheriam secretly installed as sitters of both towers and then... what? They're both super-scary and also kinda lame.

&amp;#x200B;

**Least favorite scenes/arcs**

\-Lots of political stuff, particularly involving Elayne and Caemlyn, and a bunch of stuff involving who the various sitters are for the various ajahs, and Romanda vs. Lelaine, etc.

\-Everything involving the Bowl of Winds. It seems like a quest object from a video game, very generic-sword-and-sorcery-fantasy, which the WoT is generally better than. And it also ties into the seafolk who, as mentioned, I just never cared about

\-Blademaster power inflation. So... sick Matt with a quarterstaff is able to beat Gawyn and Galad \_at the same time\_. (Granted, they were not fully trained). Then Gawyn kills Hammar, and Galad is better than Gawyn. And Gawyn is so good that he can beat two warders at once while practicing, one of them good enough to get some touches on Lan. Then Eamon Valda (who we had never heard mentioned as a blademaster)  is mostly better than Galad. And then Demandred (who grew up in a world without war, and then fought a magical war, so why did he ever have any motivation to learn the sword?) is better than Galad, and better than Gawyn with triple speed ring. Just seems inconsistent.

\-Portal stones. Built up into something interesting (alternate histories! crazy skywriting!) that just never ends up going anywhere. Seems like one bit of historical detritus more than really needs to exist

\-Inconsistencies about the Dark One/Forsaken. Two main ones: (1) The first few times Rand encounters Forsaken, they have these big black lines connecting them to the DO which he is able to sever (I've lost track of which precise times this happens). Later on in the series, they are never mentioned again. (2) Does the DO really have power over the grave? As he's portrayed later in the series, with the idea of balance, and a force for chaos, it doesn't make any sense that he would also be this Hades-esque ruler of the underworld. Why would a good person who died end up under his control? We do know that he can bring back forsaken, but can he really torture, say, Kari Al-Thor for eternity?

\-Red herrings and false leads. Back in the day, there was a huge controversy over whether Demandred was masquerading as Mazrim Taim. And there were WAY too many hints along those lines for it to be just a coincidence. Did RJ actually originally intend that and then change his mind when the entire internet community figured it out instantly? Or was he just being, umm, kind of a dick? Either way, I don't see how things like that enhance the overall read experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I was \_sure\_ it was going to end**

Before aMOL came out, I would have bet good money that it would end with an epilogue that circled back around to memory turning into legend into myth, in which the events of the climactic conflict (which we just read) are first described by a historian 50 years later, then by another historian 500 years later, then as part of a song 2000 years later, etc., with the details fading, and names blurring, until it's nearly, but not entirely, unrecognizable. It even seemed to be setting up some details to end up as "our" real world myths/legends, ie, Perrin's hammer -&gt; thor's hammer Mjollnir. And yet, nothing. :(

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, still a fantastic series, one of my absolute favorites. Fingers crossed for the TV show!

First Cycle of the Wheel: The Great Hunt [Spoilers] For reference, my writeup of book 1 can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/acscgj/first_cycle_of_the_wheel_the_eye_of_the_world/).

&amp;#x200B;

So I actually have progressed to book 4 by now but haven't had the time to write a review about book 2. Now I have a bit of time so I will jot down what I remember and my main feelings throughout the book.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, it feels like this is the book where the epic story actually begins. EotW was more like a teaser or prologue, which makes sense as it was written to survive a stand-alone publication. But The Great Hunt really kicks the story into motion. We get to see a lot more of the world now. The party splits up again but reunites by the end.

&amp;#x200B;

The Aes Sedai training is explored a bit and the workings of the different kinds of angreal. Aes Sedai politics and scheming is also expanded, which I found interesting. Concerning schemes and politics, I especially enjoyed the chapters with Rand in Cairhien and the Daes De'mar.

&amp;#x200B;

The magic system is also delved into in greater detail with the male power being introduced properly as well as the portal stones and the other dimension(s). Now as soon as Rand spotted the young pretty woman in the other world I knew something about this bitch was off. It took as far as the end of the book to be revealed, but it was no surprise it was Lanfear. There had been clear foreshadowing previously about the Daughter of Night being free, as well as her obsession with Lews Therin. Now her trying to charm Rand and the other Ta'vieren at that... Well it was no long stretch to guess at who she actually was.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the Seanchan were quite an interesting encounter, and it spawned a lot of speculation on my part. Since I listened to the book, I'm not sure if this is an actually comparable term, but sounds like there might be some kind of linguistic link between their slave-mages the "domani" and the same term being used for the people from Arad Doman. As it turns out they are the descendants of Hawkwing's armies, the old language seems to have evolved somewhat differently on the other side of the ocean, but many similarities remain.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I found it interesting that they seemingly faced different kinds of shadowspawn in their lands, like they mentioned there were no Trollocs there. I admit my interest is piqued to find out how shadowspawn are created.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all though, it felt like the Great Hunt was not about hunting the Horn, but hunting for Rand's acceptance of his fate and role. Which eventually sort of came at the end of the book and the second defeat of Ba'alzaman (which I maintain is not any actual avatar of the Dark One, contrary to Rand's beliefs). But the prevailing theme was denial, denial and stubborn, bone-headed denial throughout. Not only for Rand but also for his friends.

&amp;#x200B;

A great book, and The Dragon Reborn was even better in my opinion. But I'll write a separate post on that book once I find some more time.

How is the show going to work? Hey everyone, just started the series (I just started The Great Hunt) and loving it so far. Just wanted to start a discussion about the show. How much do we know about it? Is it just rumored or a set in stone thing? When is it supposed to come out or start production?

As I said I'm only on book 2 so I don't have a huge frame of reference for this, but to those who have read the whole thing, is it something that can be condensed into a regular length show. I feel like 14 seasons is kind of long for a show, and I can't imagine they would do that anyway, so I guess the best thing would be to do 2 books per season, and kind of mash the plots together into one arc. I guess I don't really know, because o haven't read very much.

Anyway, just wanted to ask those questions and maybe start a discussion. I'm not a huge reader of fantasy, but something gave me the desire to read WoT and I'm really glad I started. I'm excited for the show and to keep reading, and happy to be on this subreddit.

As I said, I'm only on book 2 so please no spoilers. Thanks.

Just Finished a Crown of Swords for the first time and these are my thoughts [Spoilers up through CoS] Hi all, I am absolutely loving my first read through of the WoT series. I wrote one of these up after I finished the Lord of Chaos and I wanted to continue it here for the rest of the series as I finish the books.

I found the Crown of Swords to be the slowest of the books so far to date until the last 2 chapters, but I feel like a lot of stuff that went on was more of a set up for the future books in the series. I'm just going to stream so thoughts here as they come to me.

1. Mat is my absolute favorite character and it was really cemented in this book. every one of his chapters was comedy gold, from trying to get away from Tylin to his showdowns with the Aes Sedai and the Sea Folk. I'm excited to see him get wifed up to the Queen of 9 moons in the next couple books.

2. I'm still not convinced Moiraine is dead and Min saying that was her only viewing that didn't come true cemented it for me.

3. I also don't believe Sammael is dead. Rand never actually saw Mashadar killing him because he was too busy erasing Liah from the pattern with his Balefire.

4. Cadsuane seems pretty awesome so far, I'm excited to see how she influences Rand moving forward. I have a feeling the thing she has to teach Rand and the Asha'man how to link up with female saidar holders to increase the circle.

5. I'm glad Nynaeve finally got over her block that storyline was getting tired. Its also good to see Lan come back and I hope the next book gives me the opportunity to watch Nynaeve bitch slap Myrelle for having the bond with Lan. Also I'm hopeful the next book finally gets the bowl of the winds figured out and the weather gets straightened out. The fact that book 9 is called winter's heart gives me hope that will be the case.

I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of things, but overall I'm still loving the series and I can't wait to get on to Path of Daggers.

“If I had to pick a dude...” LGBTQ representation in WoT As we all know, throughout the majority of this series things are kept pretty heteronormative, but I want to hear some of y’alls thoughts! I know that gender is very much tied to critical plot points and lore so I know not a lot could be changed and still make sense.

But! Which character(s) would you personally change the gender/sexuality/gender identity of and why? What would they be like and would you still identify with them?

[SPOILERS Lord of Chaos] Thoughts from a reader new to fantasy and WoT Wanted to do this post even earlier, but at first I was cautious at even entering the sub. Sorry if I get some terms wrong, I'm reading these in a different language and I'm too scared to start googling the terms. Here are some thoughts, short and sweet (EDIT: It didn't end up so short, or sweet):


**Favorite moments and things:**

**The way we start off,** slowly introducing the world and its concepts. Before WoT, I tried to read Malazan, but only ever got a few chapters in. No such problem with WoT, discounting the prologue. Speaking of which, it's something that completely flew over my head when I read it, and now I don't want to go back and re-read it. I feel like now it will tell me too much.

**The way the Aes Sedai are portrayed.** Specifically the fact that six books in, I still don't know if any of them are to be trusted. Moiraine perhaps, but I feel like even she had some secrets that haven't yet been revealed. I don't mean that they are all evil or anything, but they seem to hold ideals I wouldn't agree with.

**I adore the Aiel culture.** It's an interesting contrast to Game of Thrones (which I half-watched and half-read) where I did not give a crap about anyone on the other side of the ocean. I'm rooting for the Aiels to do well, even if their future looks bleak according to the prophecies. I suppose if I were to complain about anything, it's that they are a bit too likable for a warrior culture. It's like all the bad people happened to be Shaidos.

**Rand learning to rule has been interesting.** Before he came to power, I wasn't that much into his character, but after he became Car'a'carn, I've looked forward to every chapter of his. There haven't yet been any decisions he's made that have made me tear my hair out. The closest probably has been his decision to be off-hands with the Dark Tower students. At this moment in time, I believe they would follow Mazrim Taim over Rand. That is very dangerous. Some of the decisions like actually hanging the murderer Aiel have impressed me as I didn't expect him to actually go through with it.

**Perrin's story in TSR was the best part in the books so far.** Going back to a region you already know really helps with the emotional investment. He also has great chemistry with Faile. I like his reluctant attitude to being a leader, it is exactly how I would be feeling if I was thrown into that situation. It's kind of a shame that the end of that story felt like a finale for Perrin. I know it won't be, but not much has happened in the next two books. It's like he has to be around for later events.

**This I imagine might be somewhat of a surprising one, but I really liked Siuan Sanche and her downfall.** The chapter where the coup happened was one of the most exciting ones. I love it when things get hectic and you don't get the full picture of what's going on. Her journey to getting revenge without her powers was interesting. As much as I love her, it's a bit of a shame that she was healed by Nynaeve. Now I'm not sure what's next for her, but I think it would have been more interesting to watch her do great things without powers.


**Least favorite moments and things:**

**The girls on the chase.** I actually don't have a huge problem with the characters themselves. Nynaeve and Elayne are quite likable to me despite their obvious flaws. Egwene is annoying, but perhaps that's fitting for the one who became the Amyrlin. That said, the actual storylines they go through have not grabbed me. I think I would have really liked it if Egwene became a proper Aiel and refused to go back. That would have been interesting. I do like traveling chapters and the interactions that happen, but in the big picture their whole journey feels a bit pointless. Oh and another thing I dislike about the girls are how they all happen to be extremely powerful by nature.

**I hate prophecies and these books are full of them.** Some of the prophecies just come out of nowhere and I'm left feeling like the author just spoiled the next few books for me. Ta'veren feels like an excuse for all the unlikely things that happen to our main characters. That said, the saving grace is that the author went all out on it. Prophecies and destiny and the wheel of time seem to be, well, the very main concepts of The Wheel of Time. So I'll buy it, though I won't be happy about it.

**Rand's harem befuddles me.** It's so unnatural how Elayne and Min fell in love with him. Aviendha I can buy somewhat. Related to the last point I made, it seems it's all destined to be. My HOPE is that the reason they just fell in love so easily is because this is one of the stories that are supposed to happen over and over through time like Birgitte falling in love with whoever the guy was. If I had to call an "ending" to the story, it would be Rand and the three girls forming a circle (which I don't even know if it's possible) to defeat the big bad.

**The traveling stone plot hole**. Or is it? I'm not sure as I haven't re-read anything. But as I remember it, when they traveled in The Great Hunt, they saw through thousands of different lives they could lead. This would give them a tremendous amount of information they could use in their current life. It was never brought up again and it annoyed me a lot.


**Favorite Male Characters:**

1. Loial (love the guy, always a bright spot)

2. Thom Merrilin (I was heartbroken when he "died". I hope we get Thom chapters in future books!)

3. Rand (who has really come to his own)

4. Hurin (not sure if he ever comes back, but he was the thief napper in The Great Hunt and Rand's first follower)

5. Mazrim Taim (pretty sure this dude is a forsaken but I'll deal with that when it comes. I think I'd like it more if he were to just redeem himself though)


**Favorite Female characters:**

1. Siuan Sanche (she might fall down the ranks in the future now that she has her powers back, but her resolve has been inspirational)

2. Sulin (there are many Aiels I like, but after just finishing LoC, it's Sulin who stands out as the Aiel in a dress)

3. Nynaeve (loving the fact that she's aware about her anger issues and even about the braid tugging and is trying to better herself. Not sure about the romance with Lan.)

4. Aviendha (I fear for her as she has now joined the girl gang. Earlier in the series I was hoping that Rand would have three girls fall in love with her "automatically" and Aviendha would be the fourth "real love", but that seems to be debunked now)

5. Berelain (She's being portrayed as someone you shouldn't like for using her sex appeal to get ahead, but despite that, I can't help but like her after she became a leader in Cairhien. She seems loyal, reliable and competent)


**Disguised Forsaken guesses:**

**Mazrim Taim.** As mentioned before, Rand's head friend (sorry I'm blacking out on the name) talked about him like he knew him. The fact that he's leading an army of channeling men is worrying.

**Verin.** She's coming off very suspicious for some reason. Alanna too especially with binding Rand, but I think she's a red herring.


I was planning to post some more plot theories and predictions, but this is getting long and perhaps it's best not to get any replies hinting that I got something right :)

How old could an Aiel orphan be to be adopted by a Wetlander? I'm building a character for roleplaying game taking place in the WoT world. Unfortunately I haven't read the books (yet) and the wiki couldn't answer this specific question about a character concept I have.

I'm toying with an idea of an Aiel orphan found by a Cairhien merchants during a normal trade run to Shara. They adopted him and raised him as a Cairhienin. Could this be at all plausible and how old could he be to not just immediately elope back home to the Waste.

Wanted: 7-12 novel Fantasy series Recs for ridiculously long Fantasy series please. (No 3-5 novel series unless they're super thick. I just really need a mountain to dive off of.)


&amp;#x200B;

What I've covered/general info: Not into GRRM, have read WoT, Farland's The Runelords, Tanith Lee's Flat Earth series, Edding's Belgariad &amp; Malloreon, did enjoy Jemison's Inheritance Trilogy (which is a stand alone, yes, but clocks in at a respectable 1472 pages. More referencing this for style/preference reference.) Did Weis &amp; Hickman in jr high, spent a few years blacked out to Salvatore for a summer. Gimme watcha got, fine humans. I got shelves o' SF/F, but I need a huge series in my life.

First Read Through **Please** no spoilers after *Knife of Dreams*

This is my first time reading WoT and I’m about 50 pages out from finishing *Knife of Dreams*... I’ve really enjoyed this series and I am a little trepidatious about the last three books as they were written by Brandon Sanderson (a great author in his own right) instead of Robert Jordan.

Without spoiling any plot points, overall do you think Mr. Sanderson did justice to the series?
####################################################################################################

Is this a huge WoT plot hole? This has always bothered me and I wonder if there is a way for the TV series to fix it. Or if anyone has an explanation I may have missed or some headcanon to explain it away, then great! Let me know so it won't bother me any more.

So, Moiraine is looking for the Dragon Reborn, who she knows was born on the slopes of Dragonmount during a battle with Aiel. She can assume he was probably born to an Aiel maiden, since a wetlander woman would have no reason to be in the slopes of Dragonmount during a battle with the Aiel.

So after years of looking, she arrives at Emond's Field and starts trying to find out which of the three boys born at the right time was born outside the Two Rivers. She finally meets the boys, and two of them look like the rest of the people in the village, while the third looks just like an Aiel... and she keeps wondering throughout the book which of these boys could possibly be the one that was born outside the Two Rivers in the middle of a battle with Aiel.

Even if Moiraine asked around enough to know that Kari al'Thor was a red-haired and blue-eyed outlander, if she knew that there was a good chance that the person she was looking for had an Aiel mother, and one of only three boys who are the right age happens to look like an Aiel... What conclusion would you reach?

Anyway, this is my issue, but I can't think of any way for the show to fix it that wouldn't mess other stuff up.

For example, you could have Moiraine deduce from the start that Rand must be the DR, but not tell the Emond's Fielders that she knows which of them the Dark One is looking for. She takes Perrin and Mat along to protect them and to avoid tipping off the Dark One that Rand is the one they are looking for. However, this would erase a lot of the tension that comes from Moiraine not knowing who the Dark One is after and being equally worried about any danger befalling *any* of the boys.

Probably not true, but I'm going to pretend it is. So, I had a random thought today.  As everyone knows, Amazon got its start selling books online.  I bought a couple of WOT books via Amazon, and recall it being their #1 or #2 ranked book when I was ordering.  I know its probably not true, but I'm goin to imagine a hypothetical meeting with Jeff Bezos on possible TV shows where he said; "Holy Crap!  Isn't Wheel of Time that series we sold all those copies of in the late 90s/2000s?  We should buy that!"

Just finished my first full reread. Spoilers likely. My short wot history, I started reading the series in highschool, probably around when Crossroads of Twilgiht came out.  I read each book as it came out but the wait was always too long between releases, with the unfortunate happenings with our beloved author.  I stopped reading the new releases when Sanderson took over.

I began a reread because I was very interested in a very specific event later in the series.  I got to that event, and I’ll tell you I felt cleansed.  I read through the final books in a rush just wanting to get closure in the series.  This reread (2011ish when I was fully distracted in college and the ladies were all checking out my finely turned calves) was concluding before the final book was released, so there was another wait before the MoL came out.

So my reread was fragmented and I remember working my way through the last book looking for closure from this years long journey I’ve been on.  I remember finishing it and being disappointed.  Disappointed with the way certain event took place, I thought things were anticlimactic.  I rushed through the book to find out what Rand’s conclusion was, breezing past the dozen other storylines of vital importance.

All these years later, I’m in a far different place in my life.  I’ve been struggling to find books to read that keep my interest.  Storm light chronicles was a temporary distraction until I realized it’s another massive series that’s not even close to a conclusion, I honesty thought it was a trilogy.  Rereading other stand alone books, searching for new fantasy/sci-fi series to satisfy my urges.  I went long stretches where I wasn’t reading anything which if you knew me, I’ve been reading since I was very young.  It’s part of who I am to be honest.

I took on a full reread of WoT last year.  With a large amount of free time to dedicate to it, I’ve moved through the series pretty quick with no breaks.  I love the fact that it’s been long enough from my last read that I look forward to events I remember but don’t know exactly how and when things happen and am surprised by the details as they happen again.  Time has bent my memory in weird ways and as things have unfolded during this reread differently than I expect, I’ve looked on it and said, well that makes a hell of a lot more sense that way.  Ive gotten a deeper understanding on things I interpreted wrong before making each eventual storyline conclusion that much more satisfying.

I finished MoL two days ago and have been reflecting ever since.  I could not focus the last couple days at work, at home, anywhere really while I was finishing the series.  I had to get through the end because everything I had been living the last 13 books was pulling together in front of me.

It was like I read a completely different book than the first time I read it.  All the threads woven in my mind, uninterrupted over the last weeks and months being put in perspective by the complexity of the events of the Last Battle.  The multiple perspectives in each chapter, constant cliffhangers, the emotions as narratives still fresh in my mind come to fruition.  I’m a single word.  Exquisite. (Thanks Thom)

This is a bit of a wall of text, I’ve had some to drink tonight, but I have never been able to convince anyone I know to read this series, and I’ve got to get this off my chest.  This series is absolutely unreal.  It will stand forever as a monument in literature, forever to be an influential piece.  Sanderson didn’t take away from RJ’s vision. Things happen as they do for a reason and I would pay every dollar I’ve ever spent on this series if it meant I could introduce this series to someone who would enjoy it half as much as I have.

I honestly don’t know where to go from here.  What do I read next that can even hope to live up to what I just went through?  I’ve wanted to reread the Dune series for a while, and try to break into Malazan, or reread the Saga of Seven Suns again?  Or I might take some time off from reading, it’s honestly to the point after finishing WoT that I don’t crave reading.

Full disclosure, some opinions expressed in this sub, such as Gawyn being terrible and useless...I’ve found to be completely true.  I didn’t want it to be true, but it was.

If you’ve made it to the end of this, I thank you and I respect you for also achieving the consumption of this monumental series.

Quick facts:
Favorite book: Shadow Rising
Favorite of the 3 boys: Rand, until Sanderson took over, then I really enjoyed his depiction of Mat, strange I know.
Favorite Forsaken: Demandred, dudes a master blademaster, Forsaken, military genius, and right at the end he was falling for the girl.  His only slight flaw was his overwhelming need to confront the Dragon.

(Spoilers ALL) Finished first read, Question on the Horny Heroes. Last night I just finished my first "read" through (switched to audible for the second half of the series due to long commute, amazing!) and I bloody loved it. A year long journey for myself with a perfect ending. As an avid fan of LOTR and ASOIAF, WOT has surpassed both for me.

Anyway! I didn't want to make yet another "finished my first read!" thread, actually had a question regarding the final battle and the horn.

Following Egwene's sacrifice and death in the final battle, I was quite surprised that my prediction (perhaps denial!) that herself and Gawyn would appear as Heroes of the horn due to dying in the final battle, didn't come true. I thought at least Egwene's actions throughout the series would have been more than enough to declare her a hero.

Are there certain conditions that must be met for someone to be bound to the horn? I know that Noel was bound due to his actions in that life, was this due to his adventures more than his sacrifice? Was it because he died in the lands of the Finn? Can Egwene not be bound due to being Aes Sedai? Does Hawkwing decide the heroes? Did I miss something fairly important?

Tbf, glad Gawyn wasn't bound cause he was a stroppy prick.

(Spoilers All) I just finished this series for the first time. I finished the books in less than two months of time so I can't really decide which is my favourite since most of them now just feel like one gigantic book for me.

I really liked how it had the classical structures of high fantasy, but a sort of realism as well. I loved the vision of a world without the Dark One, since there would be no true humanity without any evil.  I seem to not hate all the characters I am supposed to hate yet though. Maybe on a re-read.

I think it is my first or second favourite book series I have ever read, sharing it's place with Asoiaf. (I think if I only counted asoiaf it's main series I may be sooner to choose WOT over it, but I also love Dunk and Egg, which I somewhat prefer to the main series, and Fire and Blood.)

Also a random thought here. I can't be the only one who thought that Vandene Sedai was of the Black Ajah, right? It would have been quite a good twist if that had been the case, since she would have killed her sister herself and wasn't suspected at all by Elayne or Birgitte.

I can't really decide on a favourite character, but my least favourite character is Gawyn. He is the only character I just dislike completely.

Also in one of Min's viewings it is said that Elayne will share her husband, so wouldn't that mean that at some point they marry Rand Al'Moridin? Or could it just be viewed as some what of a miss interpretation of a viewing?

I don't have anything to say anymore I guess.

TL;DR : I finished reading the series.

A couple things that I hoped to read more about in the wheel of time series Hello everyone, first I wanted to say that this subreddit has been a very interesting and kind community. Thank you for keeping our white tower from splitting :). At any rate, there are a couple of things that I wanted deeper emphasis on in the WOT series specifically around...:

* The White Tower - TBH the white tower is the center-point of the world, yet I felt that it wasn't delved into as much as I would like. I kept hoping for a more Hogwarts level emphasis and deeper explanations of the different Ajahs what their colors mean...etc. Also, there is barely an explanation for how the different Ajahs or even the how the tower teaches its pupils the power. I also wish that there would be a testing for each Ajah rather than wanting to join an Ajah that they would accept. For example, I wished that each accepted would get tested by the seven tests one for each ajah. They then choose out of the Ajah whom they passed the tests for. If an Accepted does not pass any of the seven tests, they get another chance, and if they dont, they are given a role in the tower like mistress of novices...etc. Also, I wished there was ranking among Aes Sedai that is not as obtuse as the strength level. There should be one related to strength, accomplishments, and seniority.

* WoT World - I found the world of WoT to be very realistic in a way similar to how the EU is...where Andor is Germany, Saldaea is Turkey, Tear is Spain, Illian is Italy, Cairhien is France, Malkier is Scandinavia, the Blightlands is Russia (JK its the northpole), The spine of the world is where the Mediterranean sea would be, and the Great Waste is the Sahara, Shara is the Middle east. Anyway, I felt those to be the comparisons I drew or how I structured it in my head at least though not really all that rigidly :). I do wish however that there was a coliseum of sorts a tourney of sorts across all the lands similar to how there is a call for the Great Hunt of the Horn. I believe that would fit in well with Mat's storyline. I also would like to have known more about the sea folk and Sharra I thought they were very interesting. Another element that was missing that I thought was kinda important, is a gathering every few years by the leaders of each country at the white tower somehow to discuss important matters...etc. This could be an opportunity for a lot of political intrigue that I am personally interested in.

* Eqwene Sucks and I realized why I did not like her to be honest. I believe it is because she is the most realistic and normal personality in the series. I still think she is annoying though.

WOT timeline (spoilers all) I've been skim-reading through the series on the side, and just now reached Chapter 27 (Within the Ways) of The Shadow Rising.

The timeline of WOT is totally off IMHO. Perrin thinks to himself as they exit the Waygate that the trollocs came to the Two Rivers again, *more than a year ago*.

It is mentioned in the last couple of books of the series that its two years since they left the Two Rivers

How the hell can it be possible that the first three books take place over more than a year, but the other 11 books take place in less than a year?

Anyone else feel that two years is too short and that it should be three years or more?

NB. Tolkien did an excellent time line for LOTR in his appendix to ROTK. There it shows the important events through the 2nd and 3rd Ages per year, but then during the year of the War of the Ring, it shows literally a day-by-day account of events.

We get the long per year version on the Wiki, but not the day-to-day version. I would love to see such a time line, especially if the last two books insist its only two years since Winternight in EOTW.

Where to read WoT Does anyone know where I could find a spot online to read WoT? I'm currently traveling abroad and have decided I want to read some WoT but my books are at home. So I'm curious if anyone knows a good spot I can find them.

Why should I read Wheel of Time? Right so I need a new fantasy series to read and I am really seriously considering WoT. It’s just with such a big commitment I need to be sure it’s for me. I like Stormlight, Lord of the Rings, Asoiaf and Worm. I love world building and complex plots and characters.

Also, if I do read it (which is probable) what are some good break points in the series as otherwise I’ll be reading it for the better part of the year and I don’t want to get burned out.

Thanks in advance!

WOT TV Theme Song I'm certainly late to the WOT game, only having read four of these incredible books thus far.  As I read and in anticipation of the new show, I cannot help but think about potential theme songs.  Just think how iconic Ramin Djawadi's GOT score has already become.

&amp;#x200B;

I  think a dramatic piece by Ludovico Einaudi would be awesome for the WOT score.  My personal favorites are Ancora or Oltremare.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?

A book about world hopping, similar to Kingdom Hearts. i just got done with playing kingdom hearts, and I'd like something similar to read, in the sense I'd like something like fantasy world hopping. I've read His Dark Materials, which definitely in the same vein, and I've been told to check out The Amber Chronicles by Zelazny. Also have read Sanderson's cosmere, the bartimaues trilogy, narnia, WoT, and discworld. Not really looking for any sort of sci-fi, spaceship, planet to planet sort of adventure. More like parallel universes or something like that. Is Eldric any good? Interworld sounds similar, but its YA, and the reviews seem tepid. Do you guys have any suggestions?

I am a third of the way through The Great Hunt and I can barely contain my emotions. As said in the title I'm now on the second book of my first read through of the WoT which I started with very little knowledge other than it is a very long and amazing series, but I continually am needing to stop and suppress my feelings about what I'm reading.

So, I'm looking for a quick and vague answer to a few questions. Like when or in which book Rand is going to accept that he is the Dragon reborn, when or if he is going to work with the aes sedai, if it is going to be like this the whole read which ,if it is, isn't bad but exhausting, and how I should go about reading the series?

Should I read wheel of time? So I like books but 14 books sounds ridiculous.

Also the lore makes no sense.So first age is ours but second age they using awords?Theres also a random ball floating above a college?whatever most fantasy authors suck as t worldbuilding.

The map is also a huge negative.Like during the aiel war 170k men were raised? Lol what a ridiculous number.Like that tiny ass part of a tiny ass continent could raise more than 10k men.

Anyway  I'm not looking for some fantasy technobabble crap.I dont want no boring outdated goofy 2 shoes protagonist.

World of RJ's Wheel of Time vs Wheel of Time Companion So as far as I know, these two are the only companion books to this series. Is any of them worth reading? Do they add anything to the world or do I learn everything in the main books anyway? Which one is better? I've read that WoT Companion is just a big glossary, while World is more of a history book of the world. I love reading about lore and history, so should I go for World? What do you think?

On a month long work trip and I brought the wrong book! As the title says, i'm in the DRC for the next 30 days for work. I'm currently reading the WoT series and figured that'd be a great way to spend my time over here. I'm about halfway through the sixth book and meant to bring the 7th with me to get me through the trip.

On my flight today I was looking at the sequential order of the books and realized I brought the NINTH book somehow instead. Can anyone recommend somewhere I might be able to download the 7th book? Or at least recommend a good site for finding other things to read while i'm abroad?

(No Spoilers) Of course there's another "hint" at a TV Show. I'm tired of these posts. every so often someone post a new article in which promises that this is going to be made into some epic TV show. Do I want it? Offuckingcourse. Will it actually happen? Who knows. To quote a rediculous line from the most previous article from someone who clearly hasn't read the WoT series,
"In the wake of the success of Game of Thrones, and considering the staggering amount of fantasy and sci-fi book properties that have been optioned for TV and film, the absence of The Wheel of Time has been eyebrow-raising."

No, it hasn't. Because fans and those trying to make it happen know how detailed and delicate you'll have to portray this show, what to "leave out" and how to convey to the audience the complexity of RJs writing of saidar/saiden. And honestly, most of his fans I'm betting wouldn't want a half ass attempt at a TV show unless they were able to capture the magic and essense of what makes WoT great. Look at GoT, you *Have* to pick and choose your battles and what to leave out (and they leave out a shitton) but write it so that even non-fantasy show lovers will tune in. If it's done right....it WILL be the next GoT and that potential is what I'm patiently holding on to.

Do the right thing here people! ;)

We're in NO HURRY.....clearly. even if it takes another 5-10 years we'd rather have it done right than just *done* for the sake of time.

Appreciating RJ's writing
I'm reading WoT for the second time and something that keeps jumping out at me is how evocative a writer RJ was. I think a lot of it went unnoticed the first time around because there was so much to focus on, but now that I know the story, world, and characters, I can take the time to appreciate his technical skill. I like to read something unrelated every 2-3 books and every time I return to WoT I immediately appreciate RJ's writing a whole lot more.

I’ve just taken a break to read Pet Sematary (which was great) and, while Stephen King’s writing is very readable, it's rarely poetic. I returned to WoT with LoC and was presented this as the first paragraph:

&gt;Demandred stepped out onto the black slopes of Shayol Ghul, and the gateway, a hole in reality’s fabric, winked out of existence. Above, roiling grey clouds hid the sky, an inverted sea of sluggish ocean waves crashing around the mountain’s hidden peak. Below, odd lights flashed across the barren valley, washed-out blues and reds, failing to dispel the dusky murk that shrouded their source. Lightning streaked *up* at the clouds, and slow thunder rolled. Across the slope steam and smoke rose from scattered vents, some holes as small as a man's hand and some large enough to swallow ten men.

It's just so good!

Discussion question: what do you appreciate (or perhaps the opposite) more about RJ's writing after reading other authors?

Next book suggestion time. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. PLZ Hello everyone. I am an AVID fantasy sci-fi reader and I hit a snag in my book choices a while back. I got into a series that wasn't good, then got BAD and it has made me gun shy for picking new books.

I have spent the last few months re-reading some of my all time favorites, and loving it. My 3rd read through the entire WoT series (Wheel of Time), and I think this was the most enjoyment I have got out of that series yet.

But alas now is the time to move on to new works again. I would really like to stick to single works or multiples / series that are complete or at least 3 books in so far. I will list out for you all my favorite SciFi / Fantasy authors/ books series. If you have read any of them and also like things that are not on the list PLEASE TELL ME!

I am not looking for things that are similar to these books. I just want to know that you enjoyed the book you are recommending. Similarities in themes/ plot or story are cool, but I'm just looking for good stores.

Favorite authors and accompanying books/ series.

Peter F. Hamilton- Commonwealth Saga, Void trilogy , and Chronicle of the Fallers. All set in the same universe with some interconnecting characters in all three series. 100/10

Robert Jordan- WoT 100/10

Brandon Sanderson - ALL 100/10

John Ringo - Posleen war, Paladin of shadows, Voyage of the Space Bubble, Troy Rising. 9/10- his politics can sometimes come through pretty clearly and it puts some people off a bit, great stories though.

Larry Correia - Monster Hunter Series, entire, 10/10 super fun and shootie

J/k- Harry Potter 10/10

Craig Alanson - Expeditionary Force 10/10

Edward W. Robertson - Cycle of Arawn and Cycle of Galand 10/10

George R. R. Martin - GoT DUH! 10/10

Jack Campbell - The lost fleet, The lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier 10/10

Patrick Rothfuss - Name of the Wind 10/10

Tom Clancy - Jack Ryan series 10/10

Dan Simmons - Hyperion series 10/10 (thinker)

Stephen King - It, Under the Dome, The Stand, Dreamcatcher 10/10

If you have read and enjoyed ANY of the books / series I have listed here I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND everything on this list. They do vary WIDELY but they are all good. I hope to introduce some of you to something new and interesting.

Now any and all recommendations based on what you have read and enjoyed that may be similar to, or just interesting like the books I listed.

Thanks ALL!

Writers Tics So what are your favourite or most loathed writers tics? As in something that pops up again and again in an author's works.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start off with the obvious with Robert Jordan's sniffing, smoothing of skirts and folding arms under breasts. I went from hating the overuse of these in the WoT series to finding them quite endearing by the series' end.

&amp;#x200B;

Another noticeable one, and the reason I'm writing this post, is the sheer amount of potsherds and broken crockery in the world of Malazan. It must be a perilous place for the bare footed to roam. It amuses me to think of the unshod denizens of the Malazan Empire (and beyond) forever hopping around and plucking splinters of crockery from their feet for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet another one, from something I read recently, is Terry Brooks' murderous usage of adjectives in the original Shannara trilogy. It must be an eerie universe considering everyone does everything wordlessly, noiselessly or soundlessly. These actually irritated me to the extent that I dropped the series after the first 3 books and moved onto the Malazan Book of the Fallen series instead. I can only read about something glowing redly or hotly or describing something as brokenly, as well as the 3 aforementioned examples and a host of others, so many times before I'm in danger of dislocating my retinas due to continuous eye rolling.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other notable ones?

(Spoilers All) The FAQing reread: The Shadow Rising Just The FAQs Back when the early days of the series, fans congregated on the usenet communities rec.arts.sf.written and (later) rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan to obsess over the books and share theories. Eventually people gathered the theories together and hammered out the FAQ for the books.

With each new book, the FAQ would be updated with new theories, old theories disproved and confirmed. It became must read material for WoT nerds. Robert Jordan even commented on how surprised he was by the fans' attention to detail. He once commented that the FAQ was  "about one-third correct, one-third close but not quite, and one-third dead wrong."

I thought it would be fun to take a good look at the old FAQs for each book, now that we are in Jordan's place and know everything. Here is [The Shadow Rising FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20020624122012/http://www.linuxmafia.com/pub/jordan/OLD-FAQS/93-10.FAQ)

Six months later and I just finished the WoT. And I feel lost.

What a series, what a six months, what an ending.

It's definitely too soon for me to start thinking about the bits I didn't enjoy or felt were dragged out too much, but this has been one of the greatest experiences of my life and although it will definitley be a number of years down the line before I dive back in for a re-read, I am already excited thinking about it.

Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.

Just finished Path of Daggers. Here are my thoughts [Spoilers through PoD] Hi all, I'm just doing my first read through of the Wheel of Time and I like to come here and give some reactions/predictions from a first time reader. [I did one for Crown of Swords](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/at8q1o/just_finished_a_crown_of_swords_for_the_first/)

So from what I've been led to understand is that this stretch of books from 8-10 are kind of the grind of the series. I enjoyed Path of Daggers, maybe because it was the shortest of the books so far in the series it didn't feel like that much of a drag to me. Sure there were no battles with the Foresaken, but it laid some solid groundwork for the books moving forward. So here are some thoughts as they come to me:

1. There not being a Mat chapter and his whereabouts still being a mystery annoys me, only because he is by far the best character in the series. Hopefully he's not actually dead, which i don't think he is because of that *ta'veren* plot armor

2. Elayne and Nynaeve kinda got on my nerves this book, more so Nynaeve. She was too engrossed with Lan to be of any real use this book and that made me kinda sad, because I like her. Hopefully she comes back to her senses in Winter's Heart.

3. Rand going *Callandor* on the Seanchan was pretty badass and unexpected. Unfortunately it seems it killed a bunch of his own people as well and led to the battle basically being a stalemate. I think it also led to what happened at the end when the *Asha'man* tried to kill Rand in his room.

4. Semirhage has entered the fray seemingly to target Elayne and the lion throne. She seems particularly evil so I'm excited to see where that plotline goes over the next couple books. I was pretty happy to see Jaichim Carridin end up dead in a particularly satisfying manner.

5. Alviarin is cartoonishly evil at this point, and the sooner she ends up dead the better imo.

6. Speaking of the white tower, it was cool to see that the oath rod is going to be helpful in rooting out the Black Ajah. I still hate most Aes Sedai though.

7. Egwene i guess did something strategic? She declared war on Elaida but at the same time ensured the Hall wouldn't do a damn thing outside of that war for her. I am interested to see how the seige of Tar Valon goes down with Black Ajah on both sides. Also Halima is still hanging around being a man trapped in a females body.

All in all I think Path of Daggers was a good read and I'm exciting to see where the story goes in Book 9.

P.S. I still don't think Moiraine or Lanfear are dead. They are just trapped in that other reality inside that *ter'angreal* and can't get out because of the whole melting thing. I think Moiraine is going to come back with some new super awesome Aes Sedai powers.

Some thoughts about the ageless look in the TV series **TL;DR because I know this was too long:** I don't think there is any realistic way to achieve the ageless look in a TV series.

I think the show should simply have Aes Sedai age not as slowly as other channelers. This would have the benefit of allowing more diverse looking Aes Sedai, rather than having to cast just young-looking women to look a certain "indeterminate" age.  You could have actresses in their 40s, 50s, 60s, etc., playing Aes Sedai who are supposed to be older than they look-- just not as old as Wise Ones, Windfinders, etc. who look that age.

\*\*\*

So, I believe the ageless look is about the only thing that most surely has to go for the TV show. I can only think of three ways to achieve it, none of which seem like a good idea:

• Cast only women over 40 or 50 with plastic surgery, or who have aged remarkably well, as Aes Sedai - Would be too limiting. Instead of casting the best actress for each role, they would have to choose from within this very limited subset.

• Do something with CG to every Aes Sedai character's face. - This seems expensive and could look too off-putting.

• Have every Aes Sedai's face be caked with makeup. - I can't claim that I know what an expert makeup artist can achieve, but I think this has the risk of looking ridiculous.

And before anyone points it out, yes, the show will probably merge many of the tertiary, unmemorable Aes Sedai. But it will still need to have tertiary Aes Sedai as background characters in many scenes (Rand receiving delegations, Egwene politicking in the Tower), and to have to give them all a certain specific "look" seems like a logistical nightmare.

So I think the agelessness has to go, and instead Aes Sedai should simply experience "slowing", like all other channelers. But —since I do think it's important to have Aes Sedai be shorter-lived than other channelers— have the Oath Rod quicken the pace of the slowing, so they age not as slowly as other channelers, but still slower than regular people.

The agelessness seems like an important part of WoT because it is mentioned so often, but at the same time, I cannot think of any reason right now why Aes Sedai looking like everyone else would change anything about the plot. If someone in the show needs to recognize immediately that someone is an Aes Sedai, they can notice the ring. If someone needs to recognize an Aes Sedai that is trying to hide that they are an Aes Sedai and not wearing the ring, then an Aes Sedai with an "ageless look" would have hidden their face anyway. The writers would simply have to come up with another way for the character to recognize an Aes Sedai. This would have the benefit of showing us the main characters being smart and perceptive, since they could simply play it like the trope in many stories in which the streetwise or perceptive character recognizes that someone is an undercover cop or a spy just by noticing a few tell-tale details.

In fact, when I first read EotW, I simply assumed Moiraine looked like a young woman, but had the eyes, self-possession, and way of carrying herself of someone older and wiser. (That might have been RJ's intention at the beginning). The characters in the show could simply recognize Aes Sedai that way: they can simply be wordly enough, and intuitive enough, to recognize what is off about a young-looking woman who seems preternaturally self-assured and confident in her power, and wise beyond her years.

Another advantage to this change: the "agelessness" thing has always been kind of ageist, a way for RJ to have his cake and eat it too: he can say his books have a bunch of powerful, older, women characters, but without having his readers picture them as actual older women with wrinkles. This would allow the show to cast older, more experienced actresses for some important Aes Sedai characters. If you are the type to get angry about this and complain about SJWs trying to change everything for diversity's sake, think about how you would feel if you were an older working actress, and you heard that they are casting a TV series based on books that feature many interesting mature female characters... and then heard that they were just casting women under 40 to play those parts.

And also, while I am sure that there are many young actresses with the talent to convincingly portray a powerful character who is older than she looks, I don't think you can find that many who will be available to play tertiary characters in random scenes in an Amazon fantasy series. To have a bunch of scenes with just random 20- or 30-something actresses trying to act like they are the most powerful, mysterious, intimidating women, who control thrones and manipulate the world, could risk looking kind of ridiculous, like a college production of a scene that should feature older actors. You need to be able to cast some older actresses with actual gravitas. (To be clear: a bunch of young men pretending that they are a powerful mysterious cabal would look ridiculous too. Series and movies typically cast men at least in their late forties for that type of role).

For this to work, you may need to change the canonical age of some characters. For example, if they wanted to cast a great actress in her 40s or 50s to play Verin, they would need to make her TV age be in the 80s or 90s. But I don't think there is any Aes Sedai character for which this change would make much of a difference. In fact, most people don't know or care about the ages of most of the characters in WoT, since they are hardly mentioned at all.

(Spoilers extended) WoT vs Asoiaf...is there actual similarities?( I am not the guy trying to compare the stories.) I am curious, is WoT good? Or worth the read? With a couple of obvious exceptions(ex: Lotr, Harry Potter(?)) Asoiaf is my first taste of fantasy. I love it, it’s my favorite story and world of all time, and it’s not even close. GRRMs world is amazing, the world building and the realism is so gripping it feels like a real world. So my question is, is WoT similar to Asoiaf, and is it a good story? It’s what 14(?) books long? Is the story worth breaking down and spending the time reading that many novels? Are there similarities between the stories that would make it easier for me to transition to that story?

So I'm halfway through Book 8... Picked up the first WoT by happenstance when in a bookstore in New York that wraps it's books in brown paper and you have to go purely on what you have previously read/enjoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely loved it, burned through the first book and had the 2nd and 3rd on order the next day. The infatuation with the series continued however I am now falling prey to the slog. The last few books, including book 8, have been a battle of wills, a test of perseverance and hopefulness of a return to glory for this series.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen all the posts about the middle books being slow and painful and then the final 4 books really get great again but trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel is a a struggle at the moment amidst all the skirt smoothing and Aes Sedai politics that seems to make up **every single paragraph.**

Looking for philosophically rich fantasy, suggestions welcome. Hello all,


As per the title, I'm a fantasy aficionado and also a philosophy aficionado (currently pursuing my Phd), and have grown weary and tired of trope-laden, mainstream fantasy such as GOT, WOT etc. I yearn for something richer, more nuanced, more complex, and more abstruse.


To that end, I am particularly interested in combining my two interests and reading some fantasy which is, by design, philosophically rich and complex, and actively working philosophical themes into its subtext, plot, themes and characters. But one caveat; nothing so tasteless and incompetent as periodic breaks in the plot for "info dumps" which might take the place of a protracted monologue or soliloquy by one character. I would like for it to be done right, with class, artistic flair, seamlessness and philosophical acumen.


I've heard great things about the Prince of Nothing series by Bakker, does anyone else have other recommendations? Appreciated.

Summary for Ghostwater anyone? Hey guys,

I am in the middle of a reread for WoT in preparation for the upcoming TV Show, and I hate breaking the chain of books to get something in between, but obviously I have to read the Underlord this weekend. But I realize I have been totally immersed in the WoT universe, and I am having quite a difficult time to remember Ghostwater. While I am planning to do a proper reread later on, can anyone help me with a quick recap for Ghostwater so that I'm not like "yeah I know some of these people" while I read the underlord? Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

And this for Will in case he decides to hop in this particular thread: there really are not many authors who can get me off of a WoT reread, especially with all this excitement of the TV show going on and the hype we are swimming in. I really love your work man!

Just finished Licanius trilogy book one As the title says, I just finished The Shadow of What Was Lost and boy was I surprised.

I’m a huge Wheel of Time fan, Lotr, ASOIAF and other notable fantasy series’. This book caught my eye bc on the cover it says “love wheel of time, than you’ll love this.”

I remember thinking this was really clever bc James Islington books are placed by the WoT books in stores bc of his last name being so close to Jordan’s. So I gave it a shot.

I immediately found myself engrossed in the magic system he created, the layers of mysteries, characters, and overall sense of direction. The book moved quick when it was needed, and fleshed out material when needed as well.

It starts off around teenage boys but that’s about as innocent the book gets. Real GoT vibes with how precious life can be and how quick it can be taken away.

Overall i was really happy I found this series. Just bought book two and will probably have it done by next weekend eagerly waiting for the conclusion THIS DECEMBER (possibly). shameless plug for people who enjoy being around on series ending releases!

I'm a bit worried abou Amazons WoT So I've seen info that the first season of the show will be from shown trough Moiraines perspective. I honestly think that is an awful choice. The journey from Two Rivers should focus on Rand, Mat and Peryn (hope I spelled Peryn correctlly, I'm not an English reader). My reasons for that are:
1) They have a mutch more naive and confused lookout on the world than Moiranie durning the first books, wich makes us feel like we are discovering the world with them, since they know so little. We experience their feelings as they undertake their first adventure and associate with them.
2) If Moiranie was in their place as the lead, all of this would be stripped away. Dont take me wrong, I love Moiranie, but she is just the type of character to know everything and to expect everything. If the season was told from her perspective, most of the mystery about the world and Aes Sedai especially would be gone.
3) As mutch as she is cool, Moiranine isnt really as either interesting or imprtant as anyone from the main three. She doesnt really have any development too. On the other hand, the main three are defined a lot in the first book and we can see how they change trought the series. Compared to them, Mooraine just feels like a weird choice. It would be like telling the furts half of the New Hope from Obi-Wans perspective.

Why are we giving WOT a free pass? Let me just start by saying that WOT was my first true fantasy experience and I have infinite nostalgia from it. Also everyone has their own preference I know, but with that being said why are people not accepting the fact that WOT, is not very good and that it turned into a cash grab series. There were several books in which I was bored to tears by, and it felt like Robert jordan was publishing anything that popped into his head. GRRM gets tons of shit for his last two books in asoiaf but at least they were entertaining and thought provoking. But it seems that people just take it for granted that WOT has some bad apples in the series. Also IMO the show will not work, don’t @ me.
Thoughts?

Finished part 3 of Mistborn Just finished part three of the final empire.  I thought it got off to a slower start than Elantris but appreciated the world building of the book. I feel like there's a lot of foreshadowing which means books two and three will be faster paced. I'm completely hooked now and immersed in this fantasy world. This and WOT of which i am on book two of are the two series i can really see the imagery as i read and it feels real. I really liked the mennis talk with kelsier and vin's plea to kelsier not to kill himself trying to save the men. They could have been really cliched scenes but i really felt the emotion and the impact. I think its really important that action is offset by character and plot development like these scenes and earlier the more philosophical scenes which i really enjoyed. My theory is that they will win but kelsier will become like the new lord ruler and a bit of a tyrant. I also noticed vin could see better than kelsier in the caves. My theory is vin is a more powerful mistborn and there is more to her noble heritage than we know so far.  There's also something important about the lord ruler paragraphs at the start of each chapter but i cant quite work it out yet.  Maybe the prophecies were for vin not the lord ruler. Maybe the prophecies are changeable like ta'varen in the WOT and vin is the equivalent of a ta'varen and the lord ruler failed but vin can change them as the most powerful mistborn. Anyway my aim is to read all of Brandon's books in published order so that i can uncover the cosmere. I must say that the only thing from Elantris that I've picked up so far is Hoid. There must be more but i just dont have enough information yet. Thanks to u/mistborn for this awesome book. If you do see this perhaps it would be fun to talk about my theories so you can see what a first time fan's experience is like! Ps i lovvvve Elantris and thinm its nowhere near as bad as people say. Mistborn people say is so much better bur I've found them on par. Perhaps Mistborn is a little less cliched and better developed so the twists arent as obvious but elantris is still just as good.

Should I use a guide for WoT? Well, i'm about the dive into the Wheel of Time series. I have herd it can be confusing at times since there is just so much of it. I like to think that I can fallow most epic fantasy stories on my own. But I don't want to struggle to understand what is going on. So would a guide be a good idea??

Something to capture my interest immediately I've had a lot of trouble delving into a book recently, partially due to a shortened attention span and partially due to being bored by the subject nature of any book I pick up.

I want to try a book that will grip me from the get-go and make me stick with it. I'm not opposed to shorter books.

General likes are fantasy novels (ASOIAF, WoT, Belgariad, works by Sanderson, etc), Sherlock Holmes stories, Star Wars EU novels. My most recent read (which I read pretty eagerly) was [A Pride of Kings by Juliet Dymoke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1320465.A_Pride_of_Kings) and [The Emperor's Soul by Brandon Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13578175-the-emperor-s-soul).

I haven't read a whole lot of Sanderson, so I might be willing to explore his works. I did read some of Elantris and some of The Way of Kings, with some interest, but for one reason or another have not been able to return to them.

Thanks for the help

Should I read WoT? I've read LotR, and was looking to find another fantasy series to enjoy. From what I've heard, WoT is one of the best after LotR, and I wondered if it was the worth the investment. It seems the books start off strong, but eventually get bogged down in subplots. Usually I don't mind a story that takes it time, but 3-4 books of subplots is...a lot to ask. What should I expect from this series?

Should I read Oathbringer or Eye of the World? Last month I read both book one and two of The Stormlight Archive and I have loved it too bits. I'm so into the story and love Brandon's writing. I'm also in love with all of the characters. However, I read these two books pretty quick and am thinking I should take a break for a bit, as I don't want to get bored. I was thinking about reading the first book in WoT, since I have been wanting to start this series for ages now.

Do I just tough it out and read Oathbringer first? Or should I put Stormlight down for a bit and start something new? Any thoughts?

Extra tEotW Prologue!! I was today years old when I found out that Robert Jordan wrote a different prequel for tEotW called "Ravens" from Egwene's POV several years before the events of Chp1.

It is geared towards kids but I still devoured it. I briefly recaptured that feeling of the first time I was reading WoT. I've done so many re-reads and re-listens, but there was something magical about reading new material that I had never seen before.

It makes me wish there were another 100,000 pages to read in the series. I miss these characters so much. That was the genius of Jordan, the characters are so real and detailed that you feel like you truly know them. I was so excited to see them again. I'm not explaining this well, but I thought ya'll should know that there's another couple pages of the series out there for you to enjoy.

Finally finishing WoT I've been talking about finishing the series for years. I devoured the books in highschool, but only up through Knife of Dreams had been released at that time. It's been so long now that I wanted to reread all the books, but I only had the last couple, and our library is tiny, so no luck there.

I came home from work the other day to discover that my fiance had somehow gotten all of the books on my Kindle to surprise me. He might be regretting it now since I've spent all my free time reading. I'm about halfway through Eye of the World, and it's everything I remember. I can't wait to get further into the series.

Thank you for reading, just wanted to share my excitement with some people who would share it.

What characters can you most clearly visualize? Who/what do they look like to you? WoT has been a huge part of my life for decades, and yet I don't have good mental images of most of the characters at all (I'm generally not a visual kind of guy). In fact, there are really only two characters who I have a locked in picture of:

**Elayne** was described frequently enough as beautiful and blonde-haired that I have mentally decided that she looks like [Amanda Seyfried](https://www.dailyactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/amanda-seyfried-big-love.jpg)

The first time I read about **Logain**'s iconic long curly hair my mind immediately jumped to former WWF wrestler [Ravishing Rick Rude](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1092777-rickrude2_1_.jpg) (although with a hint of Inigo Montoya)

&amp;#x200B;

After those two I probably have the clearest image of **Lan** (I can't be the only one who visualizes him as a young Clint Eastwood) and **Cadsuane** (she wears her gray hair in a bun, therefore presumably looks just like my long-dead great-aunt Mary who wore her gray hair in a bun).

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, I don't really have clear images, even of the main characters. What does Mat look like? Egwene? Nynaeve? Beats me!

Finished Winter's Heart for the first time (Spoilers WH) Here I am again after reading Book 9 and unfortunately I have to say I like this book the least so far. Here's why.

First of all, the lack of Egwene. It kinda pisses me off that we got teased so hard at the end of Book 8 when Egwene's armies arrive at Tar Valon. But instead of having the battle in this book, we learn that the arrival hasn't happened yet. In this book, Egwene is still in Murandy just preparing for the battle. So disappointing.

Perrin and Faile's plotline didn't progress at all! Perrin found out that Faile was kidnapped and so he sets out to save her. That's it, he does nothing else in this book. And even this little takes him like 5 chapters! Faile's chapters also didn't progress much, but at least we see her getting familiar with all the Shaido and Galina. Don't really like that Faile and Galina are going to cooperate, but I guess they don't really have a choice.

Elayne's plotline is a bit better, but it still doesn't progress a lot. First she becomes Aviendha's sister and I have to say a really liked this scene. It was a very strange ritual indeed, but seeing a childbirth from the child's perspective was a fascinating read. After that Elayne does some ruler stuff and almost gets murdered, which results in her creating a queen guard led by a darkfriend (unbeknowst to her of course). So this might be a good conflict in the future, but nothing happened with it so far. Minor question, is the woman giving orders to the darkfriend captain Semirhage? Anyway, Elayne also meets with the Borderlands rulers and sets a deal with them. I was happy to finally see them interact with the story and Elayne's deal is pretty clever. However, some unknown army comes out of nowhere and marches on Caemlyn. Looking forward to that.

The only big event in Elayne's plotline is the arrival of Rand and this is one of the few moments where I was really having fun with the book, rest of it was just "meh", not bad but not super fun either. Min, Elayne and Aviendha get bonded with Rand, even though Rand is trying to convince them not to. This romance was very strange to me from the very beginning and I will never really like it, but at least it's continuing to progress. Then Elayne finally gets to have sex with Rand and Min and Aviendha feel his emotions when he does it. This was probably the funniest scene in the series so far, embarassing for all the characters and I love that they just went to get drunk to escape it. Also Elayne gets pregnant and she is supposed to have twins! Don't really like the idea of Rand having kids though, especially since Aviendha is supposed to give him four! Dude sure has a big... passion.

Mat in Ebou Dar was an okay plotline for me, but I feel like it took him way longer than it should to do what he did. Some chapters describing the days passing and little things happening during those days were boring me quite a bit. However I really like all the interaction with Seanchan. We finally meet the Daughter of the Nine Moons, Tuon and she seems interesting. Her interactions with Mat are very mysterious, it seems like she's always following him around and I get a feeling that she either knows some prophecy about marrying Mat, or she simply really likes him. What I liked the most about this plotline though is the return of Egeanin. I loved her in Book 4 and it's very nice to see her back and she even brought Domon! Never thought we'd see him again! I love the way Egeanin uses the three sul'dam to help Mat so they can all escape. I wonder if RJ planned this all along, way back when he introduced those sul'dam in Book 4. The escape itself is not the epic escape from a gleeman story, but it's still exciting. Mat showing the Sea Folk girl how to escape, farewell with Tylin, the encounter and capture of Tuon, liked all of it. And Tuon is coming with us, because Mat learns who she is and he knows he has to marry her. I'm a bit disappointed however that Mat's plotline ends right there, I was hoping he would actually get out of Ebou Dar. Maybe he will off screen or something, I just want him to be somewhere else at the beginning of the next book.

And the star of this book was no doubt Rand. After impregnating Elayne he departs with Min, Nynaeve, Lan and Alivia (liking this character so far) to Far Madding. There he is hunting rogue asha'man for most of the book and the action scenes are thrilling. Also I am completely stunned by the city of Far Madding. I love the way it bans violence, nobody can wield weapons, nobody can even channel because of a special ter'angrial. If I was an average citizen living in this world I would probably want to live here. Kadsuane also arrives here and Rand is finally starting to come with terms with her. Well, first he gets into a fight with Padan Fain and Kadsuane has to get him out of jail, but then it looks like they are finally partners. Encounter with Fain was okay, I like that he's still trying to get Rand, but I was expecting a bit more than just jumping at him and trying to stab him. Hopefully he'll show some real crazy dark powers later. Also we see a return of another character from Book 4, Slayer/Luc. Been waiting for this guy and I'm excited to see him back in action.

The ending of this book is easily in my top 3 endings of this series so far. The build up to it was very strange though, Rand just says "You know what? Let's cleanse saidin now." And they just go do it. However the actual cleansing is so well written and so epic, I was absolutely stunned after it was done. Love the way Rand was using saidar to filter saidin through and get the darkness (don't know the english term for this... dirt? waste?) out of it. It was also great to actually see the darkness accumulating around Rand as the time went on. I'm also happy to see Rand and Nynaeve working together, I'm liking their relationship a lot for some reason, probably because Nynaeve is the only main female character that doesn't have a romantic histort with him. While Rand is cleansing saidin, Kadsuane's Aes Sedai, Sea Folk and asha'man are defending the whole time and that was amazing. There were so many points of view during this battle and I was loving it. We also got to see almost every Forsaken and we finally learn more about them! Osan'gar was Dashiva the whole time! And he seems to be reincarnated Aginor, which means Aran'gar has to be Balthamel. Also Cyndane is Lanfear after all! But much weaker because of Moridin and his mindtrap. Love how we can clearly see the Forsaken's intentions in this battle: Moghedien is a coward and just wants to control stuff from the shadows and the rest are power hungry and they want to get all the glory for themselves. Which is why they lose here, I think if they worked together, they could easily break through the defenders and get to Rand, but they were too selfish. Also I love that the entire battle and cleasing take a whole day! In the end Osan'gar seems to be dead. Is he really? You can spoil that for me, but please only say either "he's dead" or "RAFO". All of the darkness gets put out of saidin in the end and if I understand it correctly, the evil from Shadar Logoth attracts the evil from saidin and they both destroy each other when they meet. So Shadar Logoth is now gone and saidin is clean. Very very exciting! Amazing ending!

However the book was very mediocre overall. The ending gave me a much better feeling from this book, but there were still to many boring moments, slow chapters and especially not progressing plotlines. And since I've heard that Book 10 is widely considered to be the worst book in WoT, I'm very worried. So this book is currently on the last place in my persional leaderboards (4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1, 8, 9). But thanks to the ending, I'm still very excited to keep on reading! Onto the Crossroads!

PS: When Mat learns about Tuon's true identity, he starts thinking about the Aelfinn and about their prophecy. As far as I remember, this is the first time I've seen the word Aelfinn, yet Mat acts as if he knew the entire time that the snake people are called that. How does he know the name? Did I miss something or RAFO?

Binge Reading WoT: 14 books 2 months.Spoilers Picked up EotW at Christmas and I finished Memory of Light this weekend. These books have consumed me for the last two months, sucking up almost all my free time. Just incredible. Heading into this, the only experience I had with a fantasy series was ASoIaF.  It made me hesitate before reading WoT, because those books really got dragged down by subplots and secondary characters. This was not the case for WoT. The pacing in books 8-11 definitely slows down, but everything still seems deliberate. (The exception was Elayne's endless consolidation of power in Caemlyn only to have trollocs sack the city in an afternoon!). I could do without the eight page descriptions for each of the seven different outfits three women tried on in tel'aran'rhiod, but it can't all be trolloc battles and forsaken firefights.

Favorite bits off the top of my head:

The ending. so perfect. So satisfactory. Hard to conclude a series that was so enjoyable, but BranSan/RoJo did it perfect. All the foretelling about Alivia helping him die, but it actually meant she would help him live! I'll remember the last line forever. "He came like the wind, like the wind he touched everything and like the wind he was gone." Still gives me shivers.

Moraine's rescue: Moraine saved their asses dozens of times in the first few books and all she did was get shit on for it, it was neat seeing the tables turned. When Rand knelt before her, I was nearly in tears.

Tuon and Mat romance: not usually a big fan of this sort of thing, but I found it captivating.

Mat and Telmanes comedy duo. In particular Mats long rant about women. Mat's character def changed under BranSan. He went from being humorous to being funny. I preferred Mat 2.0.

Mat's letter to Elayne in Caemlyn with all the cusses and spelling mistakes.

Verin's black ajah reveal. Verin's the best.

I liked all the big climaxes obv: taint cleanse, ba'alzamon fights.

Other stuff: Eilfinn Aelfinn. Asmodean providing a soundtrack. Tam and Rands fight/makeup. Shit talkin' Aiel. Siuan's mechanations. Egwyne's mechanations. Everything about Loial, especially his voice on audiobook. Horny old Lews Therin in the back of Rands mind. So many others...

[No SPOILERS] About to start my first reread and I'm so excited! I listened to the entire series a few years ago for the first time and really loved it.  Since then I've listened to many other books and reread many others, but I seem to always think about things from WoT.  I finally decided to re-listen to the entire series once again and I can't wait.  That is all, thank you!

First Read of Book 1 Spoilers of the first book ahead. I have only read the first book so I would appreciate if no spoilers are given in the comments. So after years of hearing that the WoT series is the ultimate fantasy series I decided to begin the journey. I just finished the first book and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Don’t get me wrong I enjoyed it, but it felt like a disjointed story.

The first 80% of the book was dedicated to the story of trying to get to Tar Valon, and which guy the dark one after. Obviously it is the character whose head the readers are in. So that whole “mystery” was a complete waste for the readers in my opinion.

At around the 80% mark all of the sudden boom they are in the blight fighting for the eye of the world. The thread trying the two stories together was very thin  and it took me out of the story completely. The author never gives us any idea as to what the eye of the world is and why we should care, no real previous mention of the forsaken or the green man. The “deaths” of the forsaken if they happened, undermine their strength.

Also the whole Lan/Nynaeve romance hit me from left field at the end as well. Perhaps I just wasn’t picking up on the hints the author left throughout the book, but it just added to the feeling of reading two stories that were kinda connected just jammed together.

It just felt like a lot was just jammed to the end of the book.  I felt like I should care about what was happening, but I just didn’t. I knew Rand was the dragon reborn, I figured they would “save the day” to an extent. It was a book which felt like it should build in intensity and I should have felt like I couldn’t put the book down, but I never felt that.  I have read that the world builds on itself and maybe with context this book will get better over time, but it was a bit of a slog to get through especially when the ending wasn’t that compelling to me. I will give it another book, but do the other books have the same disjointed pace, cause if so I’m not sure this is a series for me.

A picture of my personal WoT book collection I admit, I do not own any physical ones, myself. My mother has most of the first edition hard covers so I would always just borrow from her and then get the rest from the library. I do, however, now own 11 of the audiobooks. I want to have a physical book collection very badly, though. I am pretty poor, though. I wonder if I could get some cheap hardcovers somewhere in good condition?

[Spoilers Eye of the World] My Season One Outline I've spent a lot of time thinking about the WoT and with the TV show coming I started a thought experiment of figuring out how I would arrange the books into a TV show. This is my first stab at the first book. I'm probably not going to post every thought I have here, for that I started a [blog](https://wottvot.blogspot.com/) which will have more thoughts than just these outlines (although that's the core of it). If you wanted to find some more musings.

A whole season of TV created out of the first book of the Wheel of Time. I expect the TV series will just be titled "The Wheel of Time". Game of Thrones really should be A Song of Ice and Fire, but hey whatever. I don't expect each season to get the subtitle of each book, but I won't be surprised to see the book titles appear as episode titles. I am aware that there are already "leaked" script titles for the first 4-6 episodes of the series which is slated to start production this fall. As such everything I'm doing is my own musings about how I would assemble the material. I will readily admit I am not a person who works in TV or in the creative arts at all really, so maybe some of this will be clunky, but I wanted to put my own stamp on it.

You will see [1/2] or [2/2] next to a chapter in my listing, that only means I have broken apart the narrative of the chapter for how I would want to present the material inside each episode. It does not mean a neat 50/50 split of the material. Chapters connected with a , are concurrent. Chapters connected with a / are POV or narrative shifts.

**Episode 1 - Winternight**

Chapters - 1,2,3,4,5,6

This episode is going to need to establish a lot of characters, and provide the impression that something is about to happen with so many extraordinary circumstances happening around Emonds Field. I think the most memorable scene they need to nail is the first appearance of the Myrdraal on the road with Rand/Tam. I always remember that reading it, and I think it will really be a striking moment to signal the adventure is about to begin. The climax of the episode needs to be the assault on the farm and it should end with Rand dragging Tam rambling into the night with him unsure of the revelation that his father found him on Dragonmount.

**Episode 2 - Roads to Bigger Places than You've Seen** (I don't love this title, but the more obvious ones are kinda boring)

Chapters - 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

This should be an episode where we can fit in some exposition, we need to make sure that we get a glimpse of the Draghkar, and should encompass the hurried rush at Taren Ferry and their arrival in relative safety in Baerlon, however we close the episode with Rand's dream of Ba'alzamon and the dead rat as a warning. I would consider adding a scene of Nynaeve leaving Emonds Field, but I think her surprise arrival is more fitting.

**Episode 3 - Shadar Logoth**

Chapters - 15,16,17,18,19,20

We get to start off in Baerlon before rapidly leaving (have to reintroduce Nynaeve), and the chase to Shadar Logoth. This gives us a few chances to have some action before the lull in Logoth prior to the frantic escape. My big adjustment to this chapter is really in the visual arrangement of their escape (we likely need to see a bit more of Nynaeve escaping to the river), and I would break up Rand/Mat/Thom's escape to mirror a bit of Perrin/Egwene's. Both escape the city, then we get to see Rand/Mat/Thom board the Spray before the Trollocs catch them, but conclude the episode with Perrin leaping into the river and washing up on shore exhausted. I want this episode to finish feeling like everyone is really in a tough spot.

**Episode 4 - Legends of Ages Past**

Chapters - 22 / 21 / 24 / 23,25,27,29,30[1/2] / 26

This will be the first episode with some branching and jumping between narratives. Until then we were one tightly knit band. Start with Perrin finding Egwene, stop in on Nynaeve tracking Moraine &amp; Lan, we will get a quick check in on the Spray, I considered skipping this and I think it can be far shorter than we get in the book, but Domon Bayle is a character we will see more of so I didn't want cut his time this early. Then we should spend most of the rest of the episode with Perrin &amp; Egwene, discovering the wolfdream, Elyas, the Tinkers (casting Aram will be important given his return and involvement later) and we will close with them being assaulted by the Whitecloaks under the remains of Artur's statue. The episode I would then close by having Rand/Mat/Thom disembark at Whitebridge and the encounter with the Myrdraal. Let's finish as the chapter does with Rand/Mat running as Thom instructed.

**Episode 5 - Roads to Camelyn**

Chapters - 30[2/2] / 31,32 / 37[1/2] / 33,34[1/2] / 37[2/2],38 / 34[2/2]

We open with the result of Perrin/Egwene's capture by the Whitecloaks. We can then rejoin Rand and Mat's harrowing time on the road. The timing of this is a bit fuzzy to me, but I want to try and arrange it so that we can see Rand/Mat are ahead of our other group by a little. So following their escape we will return to Moraine/Lan/Nynaeve finding the Whitecloak camp and deciding to put together a plan. We can then finish Rand &amp; Mat's time on the road before being picked up (including Rand's dream and growing concern for Mat). We will then see the execution of their plan to rescue Perrin and Egwene and their declaration they have a few days to go to Camelyn, which is where we can close the episode with Rand and Mat arriving at Camelyn, seeing the great city on the horizon for the first time.

**Episode 6 - Ta'Veren**

Chapters - 35,36,39,40,41,42,43,44[1/2]

This will cover all of our time in Camelyn, Rand's Royal Palace adventure and meeting with Morgase/Eladia/Elayne/Gawyn/Galad (big time characters being introduced here although we won't get much time with them). That is probably the first 1/3rd of the episode, then we need to have the reunion, healing of Mat, introduction of Loial, and then the realization that they need to reach the Borderlands as fast as possible. I would close this episode with the waygate closing on our party as they enter the Ways.

**Episode 7 - The Eye of the World**

Chapters - 44[2/2],45,46,47,48,49

The escape from the ways, arrival at Fal Dara, the reappearance and some revelations from Fain followed by the trip to the Blight. This will provide us a chance to have some more development between Nynaeve and Lan as well as showing us a drastically different location from where the majority of this season has taken place. We should close with their being greeted by the Green Man at the Eye of the World, but we will have to save the surprises inside for the next episode.

**Episode 8 - The Wheel Turns (The Dragon Rides Again)**

Chapters - Prologue of EoTW, 50,51,52,53, Prologue to TGH

By necessity this episode is going to have some really exciting action, big reveals, and we finally should go back to meet our primary nemesis for the first 3 books Ishmael and his taunting of Lews Therin. I think we need to open with how badly things have gone for LTT so we can set the stage for Rand coming into his own as warning for what he faces. This episode the way I would construct it would be the climactic fight, but it also needs to establish that this fight is far from over. The surprise of the Horn of Valere rightfully comes out of left field, but the Dragon Banner will be a strong signal for the close prior to the credits where Moraine declares that the Dragon is Reborn. I would do a post credits sequence of the prologue to TGH. Already I want a warning leading into the second season that things will only be more dangerous for our heroes as their story progresses. I think you could simply end this sequence with the Ba'alzamon command to recognize the three young men from the Two Rivers, but it would be better to carry it through to the reveal of our particular Darkfriend being one of the Children of Light's Questioners. We get the vibe they aren't totally wholesome earlier with Perrin and that should only add to it as we close on season one.

I'm looking for a fantasy book like Eragon, but adult My friend is dipping their toes in the fantasy genre, and they've read Eragon. (I haven't) I want to give them another fantasy book, but Adult. I was thinking Kingkiller or WoT, but both of them seem like big steps up.

I absolutely adore Sword of Truth I know people here hate SoT and don't appreciate the genius behind it. But as a long time fan and a reader who read other fantasy series, SoT is right up there with LoTR, WoT and GoT. He writes more about human nature and less. His heroes always had moral clarity and they do what is right. Yes he has certain rape fantasies, but the world is full of rape and he might have wanted to show us how brutal it is.

First Time in Wheel Of Time, bought the whole collection Hi every one !

I bought the kindle integral of WoT, and I'm falling in love with it...

I love the world, I love the characters and their differences and evolutions, I love the magic...

I have a few interrogations, though, and very afraid to google them (I tried once and the suggestions spoiled me very hard).

I have read the prequel about Moiraine (love her!) and is through the "real first" book.

1. In the prequel, Aes Sedai are very respected and/or feared. Moiraine is a great person and then, in the first book people are just... mean and disrespectful at her. Like, respect is dead. Even when she shows her power they despise her (well, for now). I know the story takes place like fifteen years later : do Aes Sedai's reputation has worn out? Why every one thinks they are "bad guys"? This wasn't the case in the prequel...
2.  How old is the Wisdom (Nyaneve) ? To my eyes she is like 16, but she acts like ... an Aes Sedai, and is arrogant and very sure of her power. I can't take here seriously. (well I just learned she could become very badass in the future if you know what I mean, we shall see...)
3. In the prequel, women seemed to have as much power as men, even more. I was like woow that's cool, and a change in a fantasy book ! But then, in the first book, it is back to the classic sex hierarchy (it doesn't bother me a lot, but how could that have changed in 15 years?). Is it because the prequel takes place in a more civilized part of the world, perhaps?
4. Not a question but a supposition : I'm totally sure Rand is going to be able to wield the One Power, and he is the one who made the lightning struck. (I'm just here in the story, Mat is blinded and all)
5. How does the Dark One seduce Darkfriends? With dreams, like he is trying to seduce the boys?
6. Can Aes Sedai marry ? I don't think I saw that information. (There's the problem about living much longer that could stop them, of course)
7. I don't really understand yet how this thing of wheel of time and breaking of the world is about (is it like ground dog day? Time repeating itself because of the breaking? Does that mean there has been exactly the same characters before, but they failed at their mission so the scheme is repeating?) but I think it will clear off later - sorry for that one if it's an obvious one...

Thanks if you can answer :)

&amp;#x200B;

(sorry of possibly bad English)

Sword Of Truth - Richard and Kahlan story-arch coming back Hi all!

I know that many here don't really like the SoT-series, but some news for those that like me like (love) them and have been following Richard and Kahlan for 20-something years now. Quoted from Terry Goodkinds Facebook:



&gt;I want to introduce everyone to THE CHILDREN OF D’HARA, a new series  that continues the story of the lives of Richard and Kahlan. This is a  journey that began 25 years ago with the 1994 release of WIZARD’S FIRST  RULE, when Richard first met Kahlan that fateful day in the Hartland  woods. After the ‘The Sword of Truth’ series ended, I knew there was  more to Richard and Kahlan’s story. Much more. A whole world more.
&gt;
&gt;For years, readers have asked me about Richard and Kahlan’s lives  after the Sword of Truth series . . . and importantly, about their  children. While my masterwork, ‘The Sword of Truth,’ concluded with  WARHEART – 20 languages and 26 million books sold – I was burning to  tell readers more about Richard and Kahlan. For that reason, this new  series starts immediately after the 'Sword of Truth' books ended.  Without skipping a beat, readers will plunge back into Richard and  Kahlan’s lives, with new novellas releasing every three months.
&gt;
&gt;It all begins with THE SCRIBBLY MAN, on April 4th, 2019. Available for pre-order now.
&gt;
&gt; So it is that I want to welcome you all back into the Sword of Truth  world with many of the characters besides Richard and Kahlan, such as  the Mord-Sith, that we have come to love. Learn what the star shift has  done to their world and what monsters now lurk in shadows. Pre-order  your copy of the first novella, THE SCRIBBLY MAN today, then continue  the saga with me every ninety-days. I promise an arresting, beautiful,  and sometimes tragic adventure that will keep you glued to this  irresistible story.
&gt;
&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/terrygoodkind/](https://www.facebook.com/terrygoodkind/)

&amp;#x200B;

Sword of Truth was for me after reading LotR, some WoT, and the likes as a teenager the path into more fantasy and solidified it as my favorite genre. Loved the first books, kind of stopped reading for a while in the "middle section" of the story, and came back years later when the so called last books (the ones before the yet again last trilogi) was released.

So it kind of feels like a story that has been there the whole time while growing up, to see it continued is just great and I'm so looking forward to it!

Bags! This is some good news. :D

[Spoilers] Episode Title Guessing Game! Not sure if this is appropriate here - mods, please remove if it is not.

**Premise**

I saw u/marchon2884's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/aohq4g/how_do_you_think_season_1_will_be_mapped_out/eg1spgj/) yesterday, and it got me thinking: we've got 5 episode titles of (likely) 10, and from that, we've come up with some pretty reasonable takes for how the series is mapped out. Why not extrapolate a level further, and try to guess the remaining episode titles before Rafe lets us see them? I will also be referencing u/jofwu's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/ay3t8v/tv_episode_104_the_dragon_reborn_by_dave_hill/ehytr1h/) because of it's nice layout and episode titles.

**What We Know**

E101: "Leavetaking"

E102: "Shadow's Waiting"

E103: "A Place of Safety"

E104: "The Dragon Reborn"

E105: N/A

E106: "The Flame of Tar Valon"

E107-???: N/A

We know that the episode titles are chapter titles; but, the chapter titles are not necessarily from the section that the episode covers, or even the same book. However, they are likely still relevant to the topic at hand.

**My Process**

From my personal (read: anecdotal) experience as a viewer, showrunners like to name at least one episode after the book they're covering. In *The Expanse*, they tend to name the an episode of each season after the relevant book, generally the finale episode. I'm working on the assumptions that we get 10 episodes - the first 5 cover *The Eye of the World*, the second half cover *The Great Hunt*. It would seem to be a pretty easy pick for E105: "The Eye of the World." It's not a chapter title, but I think it would be appropriate. However, this doesn't work quite as well for E110. So I would probably title E107 as "The Great Hunt", since this would be around the time of the main sequence of the quest to reclaim the Horn, starting around Chapter 10 in the book.

Now for the rest. E109 would likely cover Egwene's... introduction... to the Seanchan, so the title "Damane" would seem appropriate.  E108 likely covers White Tower training and Cairhien, so maybe "Daes Dae'mar" (I think "Cairhien" would probably be too on-the-nose). E110 would be the battle at Falme, so I think "The Grave Is No Bar To My Call" would be appropriate. "What Was Meant To Be" would be a second choice for me, since it's Rand's first real acceptance as a tool of prophecy (such as it seems).

**My Picks**

Just so they're all together and legible:

E105: "The Eye of the World"

E107: "The Great Hunt"

E108: "Daes Dae'mar"

E109: "Damane"

E110: "The Grave Is No Bar To My Call"

So, what do you guys think? Would you title this arrangement differently? Do you have other titles for different arrangements of events? If you made it this far, thanks for humoring me, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts.

What is something incorrect that you have to correct frequently even to avid readers of a series? Okay for instance on the WoT sub thier seems to be a surprising amount of people that even though they read all 14 books seem to think that the three main characters are all 16 in the first book, this is stated several times in that book they are 19 ect.

[tv show] Why do some people want "unwhitening" WOT? I'm not talking about the usual token black character (they have to put them into the show, otherwise they will be called racist by 2 users on Twitter), they want to change almost everybody's skin color. Why? Moiraine is not an Asian, Siuan is not an African etc. We know from the comic books that Jordan wanted them look like as described in the books.

(Just a side question: Jordan was a white, heterosexual man. Not to mention, a Christian. Will the bosses of the show change him into a black, transgender, homosexual woman?)

EotW First Read - Reactions I started WoT because I'm a big Sanderson fan, and I've heard amazing things about AMoL in particular. I figured it was best to start at the beginning, but now that I'm done I have to admit...I didn't love it. Wanted to share my reactions. Right now I'm \*very\* hesitant about slogging through the rest (ie, if people say book \*8\* is slow, man that's got to be glacial...),
 but wanted to see if folks here could change my mind. I'm not super concerned about spoilers, so I'm not tagging this with anything in particular.

Prologue - Cool! the tone feels like it's maybe trying a bit too hard, but the "waking up and discovering that I've murdered everyone" scene was very cool.

Act 1 - this is...a lot of names. Who am I supposed to care about, and who can I just give a passing acknowledgement too?  (Turns out the answers are: Rand, Mat, Perrine, Egwene, Nynaeve, Morraine, Lan, Thom, and Padan Fain)

The trip from Rand's house to Emond's Field was very intriguing. Definitely do want to find out the whole story about Tam and the whole deal with the heron-mark blade.

Why are all the girls complete jerks, and do any of the boys ever grow a pair? (turns out the answer in EoTW is a solid Nope!)

Act 2 - Oh, Nynaeve is back...goody.

Egwene can wield the one power. Neat! Wait...so she's going to get even bossier? yay.

Wondering more about the Aes Sedai/Warder relationship. It seems vaguely "hetero-erotic" if I can coin a phrase...Wondering about Rand maybe falling into such a position if Egwene goes the Aes Sedai route...

The whitecloaks are suitably distasteful, but seem a bit one-dimensional. I couldn't really take them seriously.

Using the one power to escape from the Whitecloaks in the city though, very cool.

The escape from the cursed city (forget the name) was VERY cool.

Also, not going to tell the big scary Aes Sedai about your nightmares so real that they actually draw blood, eh? Sounds like a solid move.

Act 3 - No one notices Mat do a complete 180 in terms of personality while he keeps clutching the dagger he got in the city so evil that not even Trollocs want to go there? Really?

This whole part seemed very drawn out to me. Just a bunch of "they were tired and hungry and scared, and kept walking".

Perrin's connection to the wolves is cool, did I miss how that came about though? It feels very deus ex machina-y.

Loved the flute and juggling to get them down the road, that was cool.

The lightning escape from the skinny innkeeper was cool, but I feel like I was missing the context I needed for it to be as epic as it was intended. That too, felt very random.

Act 4 - I honestly didn't get the compulsion to go see the false dragon in Camelyn. It facilitated the meeting with the princess, who is sure to be important later, but it felt forced.

Loial, nice to meet you. Though "the wheel weaves as the wheel wills" is getting to be a tired excuse for all of these coincidences.

The whole Perrin/Rand "I wish x were here, he knows how to act with girls..." was funny the first two of three times.  It's getting a bit tired now.

The trip through the Ogier paths seemed like an attempt make the fourth or fifth long travel sequence in the book at least somewhat interesting.

Act 5 - Finally learning something about Lan. A bit "Aragorn-y" for my taste perhaps, but it matches what we've known. Would be interesting to know how he got wrapped up with Moiraine.

Final battle, wait who are these two guys in the Green Man's sanctuary again? &lt;looks back literally 400 pages ago..&gt; oh...ok. I guess they're here now...

Last battle with Ba'alzammon. This was neat. Especially the scene of the mountains falling on the Trolloc army. Even here though--the sword of light? What? How? Why? is this a thing?

&amp;#x200B;

In sum, I feel like a lot of epic things happened, for which I was provided no explanation as to WHY they were epic, so they felt pretty flat. And people walked a lot. :)

What did I miss? Given my reaction, should I continue?

I'm about to start reading Mistborn for the second time after originally giving up after TFA I'm a mixture of excited and nervous. A bit of background:

&amp;#x200B;

After finishing the Wheel of Time series, the most natural recommendation that I was seeing on what to read next was always Sanderson, and almost always Mistborn. So I jumped in and read The Final Empire. And I just didn't love it. It was okay. I didn't love the characters, didn't love the setting, and was really disappointed with the ending (having thought about it, I'm thinking that maybe the 'convenience' of the ending might have some plot implications further down the line).

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, I think maybe it was a case of whatever I read immediately after Wheel of Time was always destined to be doomed. I read a few more books, some fantasy, some not - and struggled to find anything that I really loved. Maybe WoT just ruined fiction for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then while travelling recently, I was on a long train journey with no internet and I had previously loaded a copy of The Way of Kings Graphic Audio onto my phone. I think I was more intrigued by the graphic audio than the novel, so I listened to the first couple of hours. And I was gripped. Actually, maybe it took me around half of The Way of Kings to be fully sucked in, but I think I was actually sucked in from the beginning and just didn't realise it. I absolutely devoured the 3 SA books (WoR was the highlight for me, but just marginally), plus Edgedancer. I took turns in listening to the graphic audio and reading the actual books. Just whatever way suited me to consume these books, I took every opportunity.

Then I took a step back to evaluate my next steps. I looked up a reading order and went for Elantris, followed by Hope of Elantris &amp; The Emperor's Soul.

&amp;#x200B;

I liked Elantris but didn't love it. Probably similar to how I originally felt about TFA.The Emperor's Soul was enjoyable for what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm about to jump back into Mistborn. I didn't really think I'd go back to them. But I'm dying to re-read Stormlight Archive, and I think Sanderson has earned more than enough good grace in my books for me to give Mistborn a second chance. Maybe it was me, and not the book.

&amp;#x200B;

So wish me luck. I thought about skipping The Final Empire because I've read it before (roughly a year and a half ago) but I think I might as well start at the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

Here we go. Journey before destination.

[REC] Need help choosing Good morning everyone.

Biggest fantasy fan right here; love kingdom building, multiple POVs, multiple races, MC's growth,  a good magic system and of course wars.

Just a few days ago I've finished the Wot series and now I found my self uncertain on what to start reading next.

So, basically my choices ended up being 2: either The Malazan book of the fallen series or instead start exploring the Cosmere universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the tags mentioned above, which book might be better start reading?

Also, I've started reading some reading order regarding the Cosmere books, however, it's a little bit confusing and I would like to know which is the best and of course most beautiful book to start with.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course other suggestions are more than welcome, in fact I read everything. From JP and KN novels to Xianxia and westerns. If the story is good, I will read them all.

&amp;#x200B;

 Thank you all for your time.

Having a hard time sourcing good recommendations Hey guys, first post to r/fantasy here. Been lurking for awhile trying to find recommendations for me and my book club (The finer things club).

We are currently finishing up the first Mistborn trilogy and have all loved it. We sort of jump back and forth between YA and Regular fantasy fiction.

Some books we’ve gone through so far
King killer Chronicles 5/5
Children of Blood and Bone 2/5
Chaos Walking series 4/5
Mortal Engines 3.5/5
Red Rising Series 5/5
Ready Player One 4/5
Harry Potter 6/5

I personally have read a lot more fantasy that my club cohorts as I use to read all the dragonlance series by weis and Hickman and LoTR and a lot of young adult series.

We have the Six of Crows series ready to start after we are all done Hero of Ages so we have some time but we wanted to plan what to get into next.

We love all different kinds of stories so anything’s on the table. We’ve tossed around the idea of tackling WoT but are a little overwhelmed as that would take like a year or more and we don’t want to stall out halfway through.

Anyways, maybe drop some of your favorites if you don’t mind and it would be much appreciated! Thanks guys

Amazon Alexa doesn't know about WoT I recently got an echo and was playing with it and it has all these Game of Thrones references built in, but if you ask it to quote WoT it starts reading something from a book about Hinduism. If you get specific and ask it to qoute "The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan" it will say "You may call me Rand Sedai." (or it finally did for me), but it strikes me as odd that Amazon wouldn't want to support what is now their own I.P. Or is it just too soon yet?

Also, in case you have an Alexa and haven't done it yet, tell it Winter is Coming.

[Question] Should I read the WoT books before the amazon prime show happens? How good are the books? First thing first, hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty sure the show will not be out for a good while (few years, at least), so I am in no rush or worried about reading the series right away (in the middle of Sanderson's cosmere anyways, so I've got a handful already!) But nonetheless, I have the money and the will to invest (in the near future) into the long series that is the wheel of time. However, I have no real clue how "worth it" the wheel of time is. I've read great things about it from some redditors, and I've read lesser comments. The basis seems to be that the first 4 or so books are amazing, the middle part is lacking, and the end is solid. So I'd like to hear the opinion of the people who are obviously invested in the series. Personally, as a reader, I am pretty easy going. As long as the prose is clean and not overwhelmingly complex to read, and the plot/world/characters are interesting and captivating, I am happy!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I am simply looking for your opinions and descriptions of what the series entails! I've been delving into fantasy, and the WoT (and malazan, book of the fallen) seems to be my next stop in the road. However, WoT caught my interest first since Sanderson plays a role in the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

 Great thanks!

[All] If the Cosmere is put into audio/visual Stormlight and Mistborn should be done in a format similar to the MCU. I've thought about this as I've re-read sanderson's works and studied the art of story. The Cosmere and WoT are two works of fantasy that I want to see on screen more than anything else.

Stormlight would be the main meat of the Cosmere. This should be handled like the avengers movies, with each SA volume as a "phase."

Phase 1: Way of Kings

Movie 1: Szeth's prologue, then Kaladin's story up until he is branded in the flashbacks and he survives being strung out in the highstorm, or till after the first bridge run Kaladin does armored and Dalinar saves them.

Movie 2: Dalinar and adolin's stories up until chapter 60 when they find out his visions are real/just after he saves Sadeas and Sadeas believes he can trust him

Movies 3 and 4: Can't exaclty decide what order these would be in, but the way I'm currently leaning is:

Movie 3: Dalinar and Kaladin's combined stories from the Way of Kings up until the end from where they left off in the previous two movies.

Movie 4: Shallan's storyline interspersed with the interludes.

Other interludes if they fit could either be placed into the other movies, or at the end like little post-credit scenes. Szeth's for instance, could be placed at the end of each of the first 3 movies with his final ones at the end of Movie 4.

Phase 2: Words of Radiance.
These would need to have the interludes put in real time due to Szeth and Lift and Taln

Movies 5: The first two, you could do in either order, but I think it would be best to do shallan's first, from the beginning up until she kills Tyn at the end of Book 2.

Movie 6: Kaladin and Dalinar's and Adolin's stories up until the end of book 2, ending with Szeth's attack.

Movie 7: This could very easily be the combined stories in book 3 plus the interludes at the beginning and end. If necessary, this one could be stretched by putting some of the non-Szeth interludes between books 1-2 in as well.

Movie 8: Combined stories until the end.

With Edgedancer and Oathbringer things get a bit more complicated with pacing, but you can see the pattern.

The MCU currently has 21 movies with Spiderman far from home and Endgame adding 2 more, and you know they plan to continue things after that. SA would maybe get to that by the end of the first 5-book arc. If done right, I don't think they would have any problem doing it in its entirety, especially if they take the PJ/LotR approach and do most of the filming for each 5-book arc at the beginning.

SA obviously needs to be on the big screen because it has the biggest and most cinematic world and battle sequences.

Mistborn could be movies, or it could be a netflix/HBO-style show, with a movie at the end of ERA one, and a series or few movies for the Wax and Wayne books. Secret history could be done as its own movie, or as flashback sequences in Wax and Wayne (maybe in the final book/season/movie after the Kelsier reveal at the end of BoM).

Orrr, you could have a "Cosmere" Netflix-type series where Warbreaker, Elantris, White Sand, and their continuations each get their own seasons, then you could have shorter movies for Emperor's soul, Edgedancer, Secret History, Shadows, and First of the Sun.

With the Success the MCU has had, if someone took the time to plan out even the general arcs like this from the beginning, and made sure to keep WB from ever touching it or getting anywhere near it, I have no doubt this could be done well and be pretty successful.

Thoughts?

Wheel of Time isn't slow, you nerds I titled it something spicy for clickbait, of course you're entitled to your opinion, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My creds:  I've read WoT all the way through four and a half times, and reread individual books just because I like them.  I've read certain sections of *A Memory of Light* and *The Gathering Storm* many more times than that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, here's my epic hot take:

WoT is not slow.  It's long, but not slow.  (Or at least, not in a bad way).

&amp;#x200B;

Robert Jordan's world is basically photo realistic.  Every detail makes sense, every description lets us know something about the world.  There are little complexities, connections between objects, events, and people that only make themselves clear on the reread.  There is gobs of foreshadowing everywhere, but not just foreshadowing.  There are structures, traditions, and societies that are all intertwined and mingle with each other, and, even though Jordan never spares words on small details, there is lots of implication.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this shows us that Robert Jordan had everything meticulously planned.  He thought of tiny world building things *years* before putting them to paper, and thought of the implications that those tiny things would create.  I am a person who respects things that clearly have massive amounts of work put into them, and I am floored by the amount of just *thinking* about the world that he must have done.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it if that kind of insane detail isn't for you.  But it is for me, and I can honestly say I have never been bored reading WoT.  Every descriptive sentence is a new opportunity to think about what this world looks like, and the events that transform it tell us as much about the past as the present.  So when I hear someone complaining about the slowness of the series, I always think "Wheel of Time isn't slow, you're just too fast!"

&amp;#x200B;

I think the series is best read in the way that it was constructed: methodical and detail oriented.  The mistake that people fall into is that they get attached to a specific character or event, and just want to hear that story, which makes all of the time spent on anything else frustrating.  My advice:  follow the Way of the Leaf.  Let yourself be taken where the wind blows, because Jordan (and Sanderson) know what's best for you.

What makes a fantasy book bad in your opinion? There's this book I've seen a lot of positive reviews for (I won't say which, it's not talked about a ton on this sub from what I can tell), and I absolutely can't stand it. It represents the worst of epic fantasy imo, so it got me thinking, what is it that makes you dislike a book/series (doesn't have to be just epic fantasy)?

1. Poorly written characters. So much could be said on what this means, but some common things I see are: flat characters with only 1 trait that defines them, contradictions between what we know about a character's character and how they act [e.g. one moment they're really smart, the next really dumb], or something else I hate, if the book is split between multiple character's point of view, they should all be equally interesting or else I really don't want to read the POV from the uninteresting character.

2. Unnecessarily drawn out stories. I love good epic fantasy, but when it's bad, it's reaaaally bad. It's not that I don't mind set up, MBOTF is my favorite series after all. But if the set up is just boring filler that doesn't advance the plot, enrich the world, or develop the characters, you're just forcing readers to slog through to get to the good parts. I like WOT but from what I remember (been a while since I read it), several books in the middle of the series could be summarized in 1 sentence and we didn't get Rand's POV for an entire book.

Honestly those are the worst 2. I don't mind if a book contains good vs evil characters, or if there are other fantasy cliches, or maybe the world is slightly bland, or maybe the magic system isn't all that complex (not that I prefer those, it just won't break a series for me). I think too many authors think their ideas of a world/magic will carry the book but when it comes down to it you need good characters and story/pacing. Some of the best fantasy characters I've read are from Malazan (really just gets an A+ for diversity of characters, personalities, worldviews etc) and I actually really dig the character's from the Book of the Ancestor trilogy so far. I think it's very realistic how Nona stays the same in some ways, but also grows as a character - lots more could be said on that but I've already written enough.

Everyone is different though, some of those things that aren't deal-breakers for me might be for you, so I'm curious what makes you stop reading a series because it's so bad?

(SPOILERS ALL) Been too scared to ask, but did anyone else not really like A Memory of Light? I finally finished my first read of WoT a little while ago, and I've just been sitting on absorbing the last three books as I read them pretty quickly. I gotta say the highlight for the entire cluster of Sanderson books had to be The Gathering Storm for me. The scenes with Egwene slowly persuading the Aes Sedai to follow her through pure determination and the scene with Semirhage were amazingly dramatic and fun to read.

&amp;#x200B;

That aside, I got to A Memory of Light and just wondered what the hell happened. The whole book to me, apart from some end scenes, felt like a monotonous unmemorable slog. None of the battles felt dramatic or interesting to me until the very end. It seemed like the whole book was a mixture of the theme "the battle is going well, oh wait no it's not" or "the battle is going bad, oh wait no it's not". The only moments they became interesting were near the end when people started dying, but even some of those deaths were infuriating. I know everyone likes to hate Gawyn, but I just can't express how his character had literally no redeemable moments. It has probably been said enough, but he was just such an absolute idiot, that it is blatantly insane that Egwene or anyone could feel even the mildest affection for him. He literally didn't think about the consequences of his actions and messed up the world almost as bad as any of the forsaken did in his time near the end of the books.

&amp;#x200B;

 Also, the whole moment of Rand vs. the Dark One was incredibly underwhelming until the very end when he actually seals his prison. I understand the need for the narrative so that Rand can understand that evil is a innate part of all people and necessary for the world to exist (which is probably why the creator made the dark one in the first place, even though some people think he was outside the creator's control) but hot damn having that spaced the way it was was a great way to kill any excitement I had.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on from that, the resolution of all the remaining forsakens' deaths were very boring. Call me cheap, but I like the big magical battles that demonstrate the importance of a good character's skills. What I don't like is Aviendah ending an important fight by pulling apart a portal in the most boring way possible. The only exciting show of new uses of the power was when Egwene created the Flame of Tar Valon. Nobody else really did anything cool or exciting with the one power.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I literally read the book a month ago and already forgot what happened in which battle. I could not tell you which general oversaw each battle other than the one at the Bore, and I found nearly none of the book interesting until the end. I wish my statements in here were more articulated and I covered more points, but I feel like I am too tired right now to give this book a proper review. I would like to know if any other people felt this book to be an absolute slog, because it makes me sad given that the rest of the series qualifies as my favorite book series ever.

Fantasy novel, can't for the life of me remember the title. There's not a lot I remember about this book, but the one thing that does stick out in my mind is that one of the characters "rescues"? a fairy and the fairy is amazed that he can handle Iron.

&amp;#x200B;

I originally thought I had found it in WoT and the character being Mat Cauthon, I felt there were some similarities in the way the character of the forgotten book were described.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a paperback book that I found in a book sale, and then lost a couple of months later (before finishing it) during a house move.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry I cant offer more.

Just finished the series, now looking for discussions So I just finished the audiobook series and what a ride it has been! This was my first time listening to audiobooks and it has been a great experience.

Until now I've avoided most discussions and even only hesitantly visited the wiki because of spoilers. But now I am ready; what are some good places to read discussions on the WoT story? Criticisms, theories, plotholes, etc? Excited to dive into it!

SPOILERS - Combining Characters in the TV Show So, I've posted here before, mainly commenting on others' posts, with a few theories about how the TV show might condense the books.

I've been playing with an idea that would help with the overabundance of characters. I would love to hear the thoughts of other WoT fans. Spoilers for all of the books follow.

\---

As I mentioned above, I think that, for a television show, there are simply too many named characters to put up on the screen. There just would not be enough screen time to develop all of these characters. Neither would there be the money to have such an expansive cast.

I've read a lot of comments suggesting (and worrying about!) the possibility of combining some of the female characters, particularly Elayne, Aviendha and Min. I had a completely different thought.

I think it would make a lot of sense for the showrunners to combine the characters of Thom Merrilin and Noal Charin (Jain Farstrider).

1) Noal is a minor character. He only appears in the same contexts as Thom, specifically in the later books (other than off-hand mentions of his book and a few slight mentions in the Eye of the World). This means that combining the two characters would not greatly change any other plot points.

2) Noal and Thom are both slightly mysterious older men who tell good stories. There is, in fact, some duplication in their story purpose.

3) While Thom is a great character, his character growth seems to stall out for much of the middle six books. There is not much for him to do but to be a foil to Mat. Adding in aspects of Noal's story would give Thom more complexity and more to do in the middle seasons.

4) Combining their stories will give Thom an even *stronger* character arc than he already has.

In order to explain this last point, I need to spell out how I would combine their stories.

So, Noal/Jain's arc is basically that he once was a traveller, who published stories about his travels. He disappears into the blight, then reappears, near death, at Stedding Shangtai, near the end of the Aiel War, warning about the Eye of the World. He leaves the Stedding, realizes that he has been a pawn of Ishamael and changes his name. Graendal later puts him under compulsion and sends him to Ebou Dar. He then basically travels with Mat, occasionally telling stories to Olver, and contributing a few interesting tidbits, until he joins Thom and Mat to rescue Moiraine.

I think it would be easy to fit some of these aspects onto Thom's story, and, in fact, doing so without changing much of the timeline at all.

Make Thom into Jain Farstrider. The same things happen to Jain. After he leaves Stedding Shangtai, he changes his name to Thom Merrilin and goes to Morgase's court. His long travels, visiting many countries and cultures are what help him be such a canny political ally to Morgase. He is still a bard who then becomes a gleeman. He also still has a nephew who is gentled by Aes Sedai. This is his motivating tragedy (instead of the Noal's motivating tragedy, which is the death of his wife). But, his guilt over being used by Ishamael is another motivating factor in him wanting to help the boys. Just like Jain, he wants to make up for what he's done (though we don't discover this until much, much later). After Thom attacks the Myrdraal, he disappears, just like he does in EOTW. However, it is here that he is found by Graendal and put under compulsion. It is this subtle compulsion that leads to him helping to destabilize Cairhien through assassination (though, again, we don't find this out until much, much later). He is skeptical of Moiraine, as an Aes Sedai, though he learns to respect, and perhaps even love her, just as in the books. Everything basically happens the same from here on out (particularly since Noal and Thom are in the same places for the parts of the books where Noal appears). However, in ToM, it is only Thom and Mat who go to the tower of Ghenji. There, Thom ends up sacrificing himself to save Moiraine. Just like Noal/Jain, Thom appears at the end, as one of the heroes of the horn, and saves Olver.

Instead of an almost too subtle and unexpected love story between Thom and Moiraine, the story is now one of Thom truly making a 180, coming to respect Aes Sedai, first by interacting with Moiraine, then by seeing Elayne, who he treats as a daughter, become an Aes Sedai herself. By sacrificing his life for Moiraine, he overcomes his prejudice and also atones for the sins he committed under compulsion. Instead of treading water for several books, there is some story to tell about Thom, slowly revealing the truth that he is Jain Farstrider, in a similar way to how this was revealed about Noal. By becoming a part of the Heroes of the Horn at the end, there is also a beautiful tie-in to the first few times we meet Thom in the series, when he, as a gleeman, paints wonderful word pictures about those same heroes. Now, Thom has become a companion to the very heroes whose stories he used to narrate. And he even gets to save a young boy who got caught up in schemes larger than himself, and whose name begins with "O," (Olver), thereby making up for his failure to protect his nephew, Owyn.

\---

So, sorry for the long post. But, what do you think?

[Spoilers The Great Hunt] My Season Two Outline The second book was a little trickier to parse together than the first since the narratives split so much more than they do in the first one (I don't think that will get "easier" as the books progress ha). I still settled on 8 episodes although I do think that you could squeeze the literal material into as few as 6, I simply wanted to have a little more room for expansion and spectacle while not grossly overdoing the run time compared to [my first season](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/ayhja5/spoilers_eye_of_the_world_my_season_one_outline/) if it didn't "need" it.

The Great Hunt is a far more emblematic novel of the series than The Eye of the World is for me. The objective appears a little smaller in scale (at the outset), the scale is actually larger (people locations, threads at the same time), and the stakes are even higher. The first book/season has to establish a lot of world items quickly, and since Jordan wasn't sure how many books he could write, I think it moves at a break neck pace in terms of getting to places and accomplishing goals in case he never got the 14 books (originally signed to six when he thought of three) worth of space. It always felt to me, that knowing it was successful and he would get enough space to fill out his story, the second book feels a little more complex and opens way more doors than season one could have. As it should be, even in a TV series there needs to be escalation. As such the chapter density of each episode is going to vary a lot more than it did in season one where I managed to arrange it so that no episode covered more than maybe 7 chapters and the smallest covers 5. This season we need to pack a lot in early on so that we have space to do justice to the visual sequences and action set pieces at the end of the story. The first half will be a lot more dense as the climax of the second half of this season is a lot of action that fits into the last 1/3rd of the book. There is also more passage of time this season which will need to be conveyed. This is also the first point where I believe you would need some padding to flesh out the TV story where the book did not. This will be necessary to show some of the time passage as well as perhaps add a little of tower life that is kinda skimmed over, relationships move fast in the WoT, so we can add a little extra life to relationships like Egwene/Elayne so that their decisions to act together feel a little more natural than in the book with the amount of page time they are given.

Once again, you will see [1/2] or [2/2] next to a chapter in my listing, that means I have broken apart the narrative of the chapter for how I would want to present the material inside each episode. It does not mean a neat 50/50 split of the material. Chapters connected with a , are concurrent. Chapters connected with a / are POV or narrative shifts.

**Episode 1 - Leavetakings**

Chapters - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9[1/2]

The winds blow across the land to Shienar where we can see the long winter has finally broken and spring has come to the continent. This first episode has a lot to cover, but it's also setting up the entirety of the plot for the rest of the season which we could not do in the 1st season. More is established, we will introduce some important new characters, and we should finish with a great deal of urgency. There are two sequences in here with the Whitecloaks and Bayle Domon that will hint at the trouble on Toman Head which I think need to be included, but can be short. They should come prior to Fain's breakout so that we have been given some hint of the importance Falme/Toman Head will carry this season. That way when he breaks out and Rand finds his message we can know some of this is connected. The biggest bit of this episode I think would really be casting, there are major players introduced here that have to be around for the haul in terms of the season and the larger story; Siuan, Leanne, Verin, Liandrin, Hurin. We can see that the cast is going to expand a lot as we move forward in this episode. This episode I would end with attempt on Rand/Siuan's life for a small cliffhanger.

**Episode 2 - The Great Hunt**

Chapters - 9[2/2],10,11 / 12 / 14 / 13,15,16,17 / 18

We can open with the resolution of everyone leaving Fal Dara, the women to the Tower and our men on Fain's trail following the quick mystery of who the arrow was for (Domon's sequence was used earlier from Ch 9 in Ep 1). Otherwise I think this episode is straight forward. We get to do the Portal Stone adventure, a little of the ladies trip down river with the Amyrlin, and most importantly Selene (aka Lanfear) will be brought into the story. I think the portal stone adventure needs to be one flowing chunk as I've reworked this a few times. We need to have the bridge sequence before Rand &amp; Crew wake up that we see they've disappeared. I like that a little better as a flow than realizing they've been separated. I think the scene flow will work better picking that story point up in the real world before going to the alternate one. I want to finish this episode with the arrival at the White Tower. I thought about breaking that sequence up, but really it just needs the lesson to be a very quick component. We want to finish looking right at the White Tower bright and ominous as they are lead to it by Sheriam.

**Episode 3 - Friends and Enemies**

Chapters - 23 / 19,20,20[1/2] / 22 / 24 / 21[2/2],25,26

The opening of this chapter should be a continuation of where we left the last one, in the White Tower. We need to be awoken as Nynaeve is and then we should have a good length sequence of her testing (this will be at least 1/3rd of the episode imo). Her testing is tenuous and should set the tone of wary distrust this episode. Rand and Co recapture the Horn &amp; Dagger, but still haven't heard from Ingtar or Mat/Perrin so they get on the run. Before we leave them, we should see Selene's discontent and the end of the night at the Nine Rings, but will leave the morning for later. There needs to be a mounting sense of danger, so we get Moraine's encounter with the retired sisters Aes Sedai and the attack that implies the Black Ajah's involvement which may be our first notice of them in the show. We will then get the arrival in Cairhien and our reunion with Thom. This will setup the urgency in needing to leave after the next episode. We should finish with the knowledge Thom is going to be playing Daes Dae'Mar whether he wants to or not at the parties upcoming, hinting at the danger that surrounds Rand.

**Episode 4 - Daes Dae'Mar**

Chapters - 28 / 27,30 / 29 / 21,32,33 / 34

Having not visited with the Shienarians it will be important to show they are catching up with Rand &amp; Co to setup the episode. We should then get the excursion into the Illuminators compound and the Trolloc ambush, which should then be followed by their decision to wait it out for Ingtar. This will lead to the invitation burning and the press of the horn/dagger being stolen again as Ingtar/Mat/Perrin arrive. We now get some interlude on Falme w/the Seanchan (namely we should see the Whitecloak arrival quickly, and then visit our friend Bayle Domon again so we can be introduced to Egeanin who will be important later on). We need this setup because its going to be the second half goal of the season. We should then get the Party that Goes Wrong, along with their resolve to visit the stedding to ask for help with finding a Portal Stone. I would reverse the order of the narratives between Fain &amp; Tom so that we discover Fain's arrival at Falme, and we close with Cairhien burning from Thom's perspective.

**Episode 5 - Trust**

Chapters - 35,36 / 38,39 / 37 / 40[1/2]

The setup with the stedding and the elders is first up. Their mission was the most pressing one coming out of the last episode. This first sequence will carry up to the elders agreeing to show them where the portal stone is. This is where I think we get to flesh out a little bit because we need some tower life before their exit. Liandrin's trip into the Ways is a major trust moment that serves to reinforce the worst impressions a lot of our characters have of Aes Sedai. After they enter the ways, we should get the trippy Portal Stone alternative lives viewing, however I would include a little of our other protagonists as well. In the book we only see Rand's future visions, but the show will allow for a little room to visit Mat/Perrin too I would think. What you put in there is up for debate, but there are plenty of branch points in the story where a different decision would have doomed them all to point towards (or invent). Their arrival should be shown to have put them months past their intent, which will serve to contrast and establish how much time Egwene and their crew will have been on Toman Head as well. We will close with their exit from the Ways and the ambush by the Seanchan. I want to split this narrative to focus on Egwene here, Elayne &amp; Nynaeve's escape will be saved for the opening of the next episode. We should close on her screams as she recognizes what the adam is doing along with the pain put on her by the Sul'dam.

**Episode 6 - Falme**

Chapters - 40[1/2],42[1/2] / 41 / 42[2/2] / 44 / 43, 45[1/2]

I want to open with the other component of the ambush which is Nynaeve and Elayne's escape establishing them as free to cause trouble. This is also a sequence where I think we are going to expand on what the book provides and show more of Egwene's time being "trained" by the Sul'dam leading into the current time which is close to Rand &amp; Co's arrival. This will provide some chronological context to her time in captivity, and will show some of what she has learned, but also how unsympathetic the Seanchan are in their treatment of female channelers. We need good reason to dislike them beyond their invader status. We will jump to Rand &amp; Co trying to figure out where exactly to look with the growing pull from our trio to Falme. That part can be quick to setup the dream sequence that teases the finale battle. We will return to Nynaeve and Elayne's efforts, including mention of Bayle. We can leave them having found Egwene's location and their need to plan. We will jump back to Rand &amp; Co searching for Fain's trail &amp; their discovery by the Whitecloaks that will instigate that confrontation. We will leave them putting the party together to head into Falme. We then need to see that Nynaeve's plan with Elayne and Rand &amp; Co's arrival are occurring at the same time that morning, we should leave the ladies as they prepare to enter and we will finish with our group being confronted by Lord Turok in his display room. I want to leave this as a bit of a cliffhanger, our ladies are nearby about to get into trouble and our trio are in trouble too having found what they were looking for but now being seemingly trapped.

**Episode 7 - The Grave is No Bar to My Call**

Chapters - 46[1/2] / 45[2/2], 46[2/2], 47[1/2]

This episode is going to get a lot of additional action material compared to what we get in the book which is only a vignette of the chaos that begins in Falme. I want to open with the concurrent scene of Nynaeve and Elayne sneaking in while recognizing next door there is some sort of commotion, but it's time to rescue Egwene and start the fight in the streets which bleeds across the whole town as they work to escape. We then need to return to the confrontation in Turok's residence. This is where a lot more action can be shown than the single combat between Rand/Turok we get in the book. That should be a central focus of this sequence, but let's also get Ingtar/Mat/Perrin fighting as well. When they do manage to finish the fight and make it into the alley to recover a moment we should cut to Bayle trying to stay as long as he can, and Bornhald preparing to engage the Seanchan at Falme. This will also include him sending Byar away. We should then cut back to the alley with Ingtar's confession and sacrifice as our trio move to escape Falme, but find themselves caught between the Whitecloaks and Seanchan armies which brings us to the title of the episode as Matt makes his decision to blow the Horn of Valere and we end with it echoing across the plain as the fog rises.

**Episode 8 - the dragon reborn**

Chapters - 47[2/2],48,49

Time for our first huge battle sequence. There probably would have been a small glimpse of that at the end of S1 in Tarwin's Gap, but that's a real side tour from the main action unlike this one. We can have some large combat sequences, along with the arrival of the heroes of the pattern, coupled with the battle in the sky. We should see the back and forth between the armies as parallel to Rand's fight with (Ishamel) Ba'alzamon. We should get glimpses of our other heroes, the ladies, and the heroes of the pattern battling as well to add to the visuals and the run time. Once it is finished we need to make real emphasis on his wound, and of the second heron mark brand on his other palm. We get the Lanfear reveal, and Byar's ride off vowing revenge before wrapping up with Rand being filled in on the events during his recovery and finishing with him declaring himself the Dragon Reborn as the Shienarians vow their loyalty to him. I would close the season with a shot of the Dragon Banner rippling in the wind.

If this show were to be 8 10 episode seasons (like got), where do you think that the show SHOULD "trim the fat?" [Spoilers All] As the show seems to be picking up steam, I've noticed that a pretty common discussion on this sub is whether the show should be cutting characters, getting rid of plotlines, etc in order to make it more appealing to TV viewers and non WoT fans.

Many people think that the show should stick as closely to the books as it can and not deviate much from the source material. While I understand and respect their point of view, and many shows that deviate too far from the source end up trash (cough, the golden compass, eragon, ATLA, cough), with WoT I am of the opinion that a whole lot of fat needs to be trimmed off.

I personally think that it is unlikely that this show can run any longer than GoT.  Very few shows manage to make it past 8 seasons, and I think that is a fairly realistic marker. Beyond that, I worry that if the show goes much beyond 8 seasons, it will lose viewership and be cancelled before its conclusion.

Given that most Amazon seasons are now 10 episodes long, that gives us somewhere around 80 hours to complete the tale.

Now, there is wayyyyyyy more than 80 hours worth of material in this  series. As much as I would love to see the series scene for scene, I just don't think that is likely. So in order for the show to fit into that timeframe, inevitably, there will need to be *very* significant cuts and characters will need to be merged. So what do you guys think can really be cut and merged to fit a timeframe like that? Here are some of my thoughts (many of which come from other posts on this sub):

Combine the Forsaken from 13 into 8 (one per season) and make them stop resurrecting (except ishy). Even as a 4x reader, I still for the life cannot keep Aran'gar and Osan'gar straight. It is unlikely that viewers would either.

Cut the Sea Folk entirely. They're certainly important for worldbuilding and add a good bit of flair to the series, but most of the time they are just delaying the wonder girls or rand. Cutting them and significantly trimming the Bowl of the Winds plotline to 1-2 episodes max saves almost a book worth of time.

Cut the majority of the Shaido plotline. The Shaido serve an important role in showing the troubles Rand has unifying the Aiel. Nevertheless, they take up tons of book time with very little effect on the main story.

Combine Moiraine and Cadsuane -- don't get me wrong, unlike most people I actually quite liked Cadsuane. Nevertheless, her basic role is "powerful aes sedai who advises rand and teaches him to laugh."  Many of the conflicts between Rand and Cad are quite similar to the conflicts between Rand and Moiraine in earlier books. Adding an extra character halfway through the series seems unneeded.

Merge the Aes Sedai into ~1 major character per Ajah. Of course there will be others around, but have the major ones do the significant plot movements. Of course there would need to be some exceptions to this, but we don't need 15 gray sisters running around mediating.

Merge Noal into Thom. Thom is a beloved character and I would hate to see him gone. Noal however is much more of a side character, whose most important moments come in the Tower and at the end with Olver. Thom could easily die in the Tower and come back to save Olver, while for the most part remaining Thom.

Now of course this would be a huge cut that would mess Moiraine, Mat, and Thom's story up a good deal. However, I think it can be accomplished simply by having Moiraine either "die" later in the series so that Mat can still do his Genjai thing and give up his eye.  Another way it could be accomplished would be by moving the Tower of Genjai up a whole bit.

Cut Padan Fain. Fain's climax was disappointing as even Sanderson will agree. The character was built up to do more, but never quite got there in the books. He would pop up from time to time, mess stuff up for a few chapters, and be gone. Now of course he is doing a bunch of stuff behind the scenes, but most of that could be easily explained away by darkfriends.

Get rid of the Rand harem. Not only would this not play so well on modern TV (i know, i know, GOT did it! But GoT is on a different scale of "fucked up" than WoT is. Some argue that WoT is equally dark, but it is so in a more subtle way, Dumai's Wells being the exception), but it takes up a whole bunch of unnecessary time. My vote would be to have Rand stick to Min, but that's just me.

And finally, the one I know is the most radical and I will get the most hate for: cut Perrin. Perrin is an important part of the trio but I believe less so than any of the other three. Rand is Rand. Mat is the general/comic relief. Eggy is the Amyrlin. Nyn serves as an outsider-insider into the world of Aes Sedai as well as someone who trusts Rand even when others don't. But most of Perrin's plotlines have little effect on the world beyond Perrin and could be cut without affecting the plot overmuch.  For instance, Perrin spends most of the last battle fighting Slayer, but if we didn't have either Slayer or Perrin, the major threads of the show would not be affected. Similarly, without the Shaido Perrin won't spend a whole season chasing Faile. The Two Rivers plotline could be taken over by Mat with ease (showing those villagers how much he has grown).


I know that this wouldn't be exactly the same Wheel of Time that we know and love, but that version of WoT isn't going away and always will stay with us. If we treat the new show as a slight reimagining of our beloved story, rather than expecting it to be identical to what we have in our imagination, I think we will have a longer and better run.

So what do y'all think they SHOULD change?

I'll be disappointed if we don't get some kind of Wheel of Time callout in the new set I'm reading through the Wheel of Time again, in preparation for the show they're working on, and the fourth book is "The Shadow Rising". I have to imagine there's a few WoT fans on the dev team, so I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for references. Probably nothing too blatant, as they don't want to tempt Tor's intellectual property lawyers, but I imagine they could get something in the flavor text.

Hexblade Glaivemaster Crit farmer build optimisation [5e] Hello everyone,
(**TLDR version in bold**)
this started out as a very innocent attempt to roll a character for one of my favourite childhood book heroes (Matrim Cauthon from the wheel of time)  for Adventure league aand everything was going great until I decided to try and optimise the build (as freaking always).


Initial plotline was Human Hexblade, weapon pact, Glaive, polearm mastery, sentinel and lucky. (Charisma max, + good dex and con second ( 16,14,14 and dumpy 8 str and 10/10 wis/int) (I know caster is outside of character, but it was the only way for him to be super charismatic and glaive wielding)


Now, after me reading the books sideways on how I can optimise him - I have the following. (Dump dex, to multi into pala) (Loose some of Mat along the way:/)
**Optimised build:**
**Half-Elf start paladin (For heavy armor) &gt; 5 lvls hexblade &gt; 5 lvls pala  &gt;  Hexblade till 20**
**(Str 13, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 17)**
**Feats: Polearm Master (at lvl 5)  &gt;&gt;  Elven accuracy +1 Cha (lvl 9)  &gt;&gt;  + 2 Cha (14lvl)) &gt;&gt; 18lvl Lucky.**


Ok, at this point most people can see where this is going, **Darkness + Devil's eyes + Extended Crits(hexblade) + Triple advantage (Elven accuracy) + extra hits from PaM reactions and bonus actions, fish for crit and then drop a truckload of smite damage from Divine + Edrich smite. +5 to saves, immunity to disease, tons of armor and ok HP pool.  Also spells help and I can actually work well in RP situations with high Cha.**


Going the pala route makes me loose lvl 8 and 9 spells and 1 pt proficiency modifier, but give me TONS of survivability in terms of AC and +5 to saves. Also allows me have some sustained damage. The only downside I can clearly think of is constitution checks and darkness. I would like warcaster, but I imagine 90% of the time if people can't see me in darkness they would probably go for my party members, and I can keep my glaive pokes well distanced. Additionally, going for it would mean me giving up the ability to spread my extended crits at lvl 14 hexblade.


So, kind people of reddit, first of all, if you read all of the above - you're awesome. Secondly, and to the point -


**Do you guys think its a good build? What would you improve on it ?** If you're into WoT, how would you portray Matrim?

New tattoo Iv been wanting a WoT tattoo since I was 14 and read my first book of the series. But none of the pictures or tats iv seen seem to appeal to me. I'm hoping this community can produce something wonderful that I would want to ink on myself forever. There are a few elements I want to incorporate in the tat.
1: dovie'andi se tovya sagain. Mats 'catchphrase '
2: a rough/worn wooden wheel.
3: a dragon in WoT colors.
4: a wolf, preferably in Hoppers colors.

Experimentation with colors would be great.
Help me my fellow fan dudes. You're my only hope before the bandwagon starts.

Walk in the Light

And with “Why I’m Afraid of Bees” (Goosebumps #17) by R.L. Stine filling in the Werebees square, I’m officially finished with Bingo! So I cut it closer than I would have liked, but I’m now Reading Champion four years running! Here’s my choices, and brief thoughts:

* **A Fantasy Novel Featuring a Character Named Albus (NOT Harry Potter)**: This was honestly a pain in the ass until I learned that one of the assassins of Julius Caesar was Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus (not to be confused with *the* Brutus). It’s a little bit of a stretch, but Albinus is the Latin version of Albus so I called it close enough. Once I figured that out, the *Emperor* series by Conn Iggulden was an obvious choice.

* **Read a Fantasy Series in Reverse Order**: *Narnia*. Started with *The Last Battle*, ended with *The Magician’s Nephew.* ***NOT*** *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.* Fight me.

* **Prophecy: Meh**: *Guards! Guards!* by Terry Pratchett. Counts thanks to this quote: “Yea, the king will come bringing Law and Justice, and know nothing but the Truth, and Protect and Serve the People with his Sword.” Which does, amusingly, come true in every respect over the course of the book.

* **Novel That is NOT on Any r/fantasy List**: *Anecdotes of the Great Accountants, Volume III*. For some strange reason, this was mostly about the art of camouflage.

* **A Novel Featuring WereBees**: *Why I’m Afraid of Bees* by R.L. Stine. Read this years and years ago, but decided to revisit it for this square. It was decent - it was no *Say Cheese and Die!* (#4), but it was better than *My Hairiest Adventure* (#26).

* **Malazan (by Erikson Only)**: Malazan sucks. Fuck you /u/lrich1024.

* **Tropes R Us**: *Heroics for Beginners* by John Moore. Great fun.

* **Novel Featuring an Evil Chicken NOT by Terry Goodkind**: *Moana: The Junior Novelization* by RH Disney. I never trusted Heihei.

* **Chainmail Bikinis**: *Chicks Ahoy! (Chicks in Chainmail)* edited by Esther Friesner. [The cover doesn’t technically feature chainmail](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QpKpjRQqL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg), but I felt it was true to the spirit of the square.

* **Novel With a One Letter Title**: This one was super tough. The best I could do was the ST:TNG novel *I, Q* by John de Lancie &amp; Peter David.

* **Tinglers**: *News Commentator Sam Hannity Pounded In The Butt By The Fact That He Didn't Disclose He Has The Same Lawyer As The President* by Dr. Chuck Tingle. A masterpiece like every other Tingler. Let’s keep in mind that things on /r/Fantasy should be spec fic related, so let’s keep the politics out of here please, buckaroos.

* **Time Travel: Read a Fantasy Novel Published in 2025**: Since time travel isn’t actually feasible, I asked Mrs. OfThePalace to write a fantasy novel and promise to sit on it until 2025. So for this square I read *This is Stupid and You’re Lucky I Put Up With You* by Mrs. OfThePalace.

* **MALAZAN**: Malazan fanboys really suck. Especially /u/p0x0rz.

* **A Fantasy Novel With Zero Fantasy Elements**: *Mass Effect: Revelation* by Drew Karpyshyn features plenty of Element Zero.

* **Wheel of Time in One Day**: If it was anything but WoT this would have been hard. Luckily it’s WoT, and I’m me. No problem.

* **A Novel in a Language you DON'T Read or Speak (CAN'T be Translated)**: *Harry Potter Und der Stein der Weisen* by JK Rowling, which Mrs. OfThePalace had on the bookshelf. Hey, no one said I had to able to *understand* what I was reading.

* **Read Any SFF Novel Then Review it via Interpretive Dance**: In honor of the *Lord of the Rings* readalong, [allow me to present my feelings on the greatest of all fantasy novels in dance form.](http://66.media.tumblr.com/fb7906d10f5007d1b3708d8f400f7fe4/tumblr_mg9f9qaWzg1s0m6axo1_400.gif)

* **Not Like Other Girls**: It doesn’t get much more “not like other girls” than the *Tamir Triad* by Lynn Flewelling

* **Male Authored Epic Fantasy**: *Faith of the Fallen* by Terry Goodkind.

* **Subgenre: VegLit**: *LarryBoy And The Mudslingers I Can Read!* by Karen Poth. VeggieTales for the win.

* **Novel Featuring a Protagonist with NO Vowels in Their Name**: *Star Trek: The Q Continuum* by Greg Cox. I bet lrich1024 thought she was being sooooo clever with this square, but looks like I get the last laugh.

* **Malazan (by Esslemont Only)**: Sucks even worse than regular Malazan. No thanks.

* **Read ALL the SPFBO Books**: Done. They were great. Don’t ask me about any of them. Moving on.

* **Format: Fantasy Novel in the Form of a Greeting Card**: I was getting some very confused looks from the staff at Hallmark by the time I was done, but I managed it.

* **Your Own Fantasy Novel**: *The Reddit Moderator Who Saved the World, Became King, and was Super Awesome* by MikeOfThePalace. This was a masterpiece - I smell a Hugo!

Popping my WoT cherry Hello, everyone! So I’ve had this entire collection of WoT books on my Kindle since around 2014 but I’ve never started them due to the sheer size of the entire series seeming so daunting. I always told myself that if the series ever went to a live action adaptation that I would give them a go. As the last super popular fantasy series that I haven’t read, a lot of my friends have told me I’m saving the best for last. I heard the Amazon series is rumored to be shooting for 2 books per season, so I’m aiming to read Eye of the World and Great Hunt back to back when I finish my current book (Joe Hill’s NOS4A2). Only about 100 pages left on that. I’m very excited since folks I trust have told me they enjoy these books better than even Lord of the Rings, a series I obviously adore. Just wanted to say hi to this sub and hope it’s okay to ask some noob non-spoiler questions if they come up. Hope everyone has a good weekend.

There are NO SPOILER WARNINGS on this sub!! This subreddit is primarily for people who have already completed the series and wish to relive it's many glories through the finest (low)quality memes.

Consider this your warning, there could be series ruining spoilers anywhere you look on this subreddit. Stick to /r/WoT if you wish to avoid spoilers. (or better yet stay off the internet until you complete the books)

If you haven't yet finished the series "YOU ARE HERE TOO STRONGLY! GO, YOUNG BULL!"

Marriage Proposal Help? I'm thinking of proposing to my boyfriend this summer, and he is crazy about WoT. I haven't ever read it, though.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to get him the official Great Serpent ring, because he's so passionate about the series. But I see on the website that this ring is awarded to women. He is a stickler for detail... **What do you think, is it a thoughtful gesture or absolutely the wrong ring because it doesn't fit with the lore?**

&amp;#x200B;

Additional thoughts:

Link to the product: [https://www.taverentees.com/product\_p/rj-05g.htm](https://www.taverentees.com/product_p/rj-05g.htm)

I like the idea that it represents time and eternity, given the purpose of the ring.

I'll take your advice on this matter, because I'm a rabid fanboy of other series and am not quite sure how I'd feel.

Music for A Memory of Light? nospoilerspls I'm finally at A Memory of Light. Are there any bgm/songs you listen to while reading WoT? Part of the reason I enjoyed this series so much is because of the music I listened to while reading. The first half of the series I listened to purely LoTR, like The Lighting of the Beacons and The White Tree, and any time in Tel'aran'rhiod I listened to this https://youtu.be/krD_CtRnipk Then I went through all the classic anime OSTs. I listened to them where I felt a certain theme would be appropriate (Legend of Ashikata when travelling, any theme from Bleach for badass moments etc.)
On the Precipice of Defeat from Bleach is beyond epic, and was fitting for the later books. Anytime I start reading, I read a couple pages to get a feel for what atmosphere it is so I can put a fitting song on. Before starting AMOL, are there any songs or anime osts you listened to while reading it? I don't wanna know at which points in the book you read them cause spoilers (unless its before AMOL) :^) Sorry for the ramble I'm a little high

First-time reader, just finished GotM I see a lot of these posts in other fantasy subs(like /r/WoT and /r/Cosmere) , and they're always fun, so I'll make one here.

1) Holy shit is this series complex. I had real difficulty following all the plot threads, and I went back to re-read the early chapters a couple times. I understand it doesn't really get any better in future books either. This is going to be tough to follow at times, I'd wager. My habit of reading quickly and glossing over details is not optimized for books this dense. Most stories don't go as full-infodump as someone like David Weber, but they dig into it in a way designed to be legible to newbies. Erikson doesn't, and that'll take some adjustment.

2) "Tough to follow" is not the same as "unpleasant". This is a far denser, richer world than most, and I feel like it'll reward a really deep engagement in a way that few other series do. Truthfully, the book it reminded me most of was Paradise Lost. I know that's an odd comparison in some ways, but the way the writing hints at a richer universe without much detailed explanation is just not something I have much experience with.

3) I'll be sticking with it. I bought the whole series as an e-book (which is hilarious to me, because I've never before seen a book that's over 10,000 pages long), so I'll be making my way through it. Probably two or three times before I feel like I know what's going on. So please, no spoilers (unless there's things self-contained within book 1 that you want to discuss).

The next three books w/ BRAND NEW covers to be released Dec 31 (+ speculation) Now we have [the covers for the next three books in the series](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_st_date-desc-rank?keywords=wheel+of+time&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3Awheel+of+time&amp;qid=1552938168&amp;sort=date-desc-rank) due December 31 from Tor. They're sharp, clean, modern, and pretty same-y. Oddly enough, each book is hardly over 700 pages, which means they are taking the *Make-Each-Book-Look-Like-They're-The-Same-Length-Through-Word-Size-Even-Though-They're-Not* method (patent pending). For reference, the early paperbacks for these books were 981, 963, and 987 pages.

I like 'em, but I would have liked purple for Lord of Chaos. After The Dragon Reborn, it seems too soon to pull out another shade of red for the cover. Here's hoping Crown of Swords will be purple. Or any. Just give me purple WoT.

These will be released exactly nine weeks after the first set - which means we'll probably get the last three books sometime in July. (Nine weeks = three weeks to read each book, just like libraries). Does this tell us something about the release of the show? I doubt the show will come out as soon as July, but it may mean the marketing gets kicked into full throttle.

I spent too much time on this post and I need to get back to my schoolwork.

Rising from my Grave to Give You my List of Favorites that I’ve Been Working on for Six Months (whole franchise spoiler)
I decided upon myself to rise from my deep slumber this time to give you something that I’ve been working on since September 2018.

After I’ve beaten the trilogy, I had a strong desire to get out of my comfort zone and overcome my social anxiety by making a Reddit account and talking to people. The results? I’ve met wonderful users like u/hokky , u/WinterWolf18 and u/SzczurekPropagabdy . Just to name a few.

And that’s not even mentioning the wonderful guy known as u/kaiser_flame , who was my gateway to many beautiful people on discord.

I was uncertain for a while on weather or not I should make this, but seeing various tier lists and top ten lists has encouraged me to make my own. So without farther ado, here is my list of favorite, least favorite and most mixed/conflicted characters. Who, why and how.

#Top Two Most Mixed/Conflicted

#Number 2 Yasuhiro Hagakure

Starting out on a bit of a low note, but not necessarily a terrible one, we got everyone’s least favorite fortune teller (*or is he?*), Yasuhiro!


Yasuhiro is here for two reasons, first, he’s one of the only two characters I feel conflicted about, hense why this list is so minuscule. And two, my desire to like him has always conflicted with the sad realization that he really is just plain terrible. I wanted to like him because not only do I have a soft spot for extremely unpopular characters, but he also has some genuine potential for greatness. His speech at ch6 was pretty touching. His school mode ending is pretty relatable. I especially relate to the line “I just wanna reassure my existence” a line he said when Makoto asked Hagakure why he was trying to make sure that he and Makoto really are friends.

So, what’s my issue with hagakure? He’s not funny. He does a whole lotta nothing. He’s kinda wasted. His development is undone in DR3 (he said he wouldn’t rely on fortune telling yet we see him use his crystal ball in DR3) He’s unsympathetic and tried to sell Makoto’s organs. Fucking wot.

#Number 1: Kokichi Ouma

Ouma has potential greatness written all over him. His premise is wonderful and oozing with potential and has some legit cool moments all throughout V3. Sadly, I constantly fail at emotionally connecting with the character. The execution of his character leaves a lot to be desired and I could never help but think there could’ve been a lot more done with him, has he been handled by a more capable writer than Kodaka, who is admittedly not all that great and has shown to be rather inconsistent throughout the series with various high and lows that makes it difficult to definitively call him great, even good. But I won’t delve into this too much as I’m starting to go off topic. Instead, let’s move on to my next list.

#Top Three Least Favorite Characters

Another small list because I don’t hate, or even dislike a lot of characters. Heck, even the three characters I’m about to mention are people that I’m mostly neutral on. It’s just that they consistently end up at the bottom each time I try to make a consistent list.

#Number 3: Kaede Akamatsu

Much like ouma, Akamatsu’s execution left a lot to be desired. I wanted to like her so badly but I can’t help but react with phrases like “that’s it?” and “oh well” each time I expect her to do something big but be met with disappointment. Her romance with Succi felt shoehorned in and unnatural. Especially in her FTEs where she seems to have a huge romantic interest in a guy she literally just met. I don’t understand it at all. It feels so forced and kinda pandering.

I’m also not a big fan of the tremendous lack of screen time she gets. She feels underdeveloped as a result of that and I really wanted to see a lot more of her. Oh well.

#Number 2: Junko Enoshima

The very definition of a one dimensional villain. Honestly, do I even need explain this one? There’s absolutely no depth to her character and any attempt at adding depth to her falls flat on its face. It’s also so stupid that Kodaka with his typical Kodaka shenanigans felt the need to add the unneeded and explained what didn’t need explaining and showed us how she conquered the world. Why? Who asked for this? Who was unable to get any sleep at night until they learned how some dumb high school fashionista chick ruled the world? Kodaka, most likely. Has he not even heard of the term “mystery”. Well, I doubt someone like him would hear about it after he has killed any sense of it whatsoever. Do I even need to bring up brain washing? The one thing, the one thing she had going for her, which is “how did she make the DR2 cast fall to despair?” was completely ruined by brainwashing. Gimme a break.

It doesn’t help that she’s annoying and not fun at all.

#Number 1: Chiaki Nanami

Mary sue with zero personality meant for pandering. Not even worth the energy or time to delve into her.

#Top 4 Favorite Characters

#Number 4: Byakuya Togami

“Such ignorance”

Byakuya Togami is quite possibly the biggest asshole in DR history.

So why is he so high?

Because it felt so satisfying to keep believing that he’ll turn out great and be more than right about it.

The journey was tough. My beliefs were constantly challenged. To the point where I was this close to giving up to the popular opinion that he really is just a straight up asshole. I felt really bitter about it. But despite all that. Despite the odds being always against me, I kept believing to the very end. And I ended up loving him to bits. He really is the anti-hagakure. In a sense that unlike hagakure, my belief in him paid off, and boy did it pay off tremendously.

Great school mode ending. Great FTEs. Fun character. Awesome speech at ch6. Somehow dodged the DR3 Kodaka Axe and was not ruined. Has one of the most delicious voices in English (it’s a crime he got replaced in the anime’s dub)

And to top it all off, his relationship with Naegi feels, grows and progresses totally naturally.

He also has one of my favorite backstories in the whole series.

#Number 3: Shuichi Saihara

Let’s just start off by saying that ch1 has my absolute favorite twist *in all of DR*.

Shuichi also has my favorite character design in the

Let’s not forget that alongside Byakuya, Hajime, Tanaka and Makoto, he has one of my favorite English voices.

It’s hard to describe why I like Shuichi so much. But my best guess is that I’m so attracted to his never-say-die attitude.

I don’t agree that he had some major confidence issues or that he even had an arc. His development in Ch1 was way too quick and snappy for it to count as an arc. And he hardly acted differently throughout ch2-ch4. Sure, he had some moments of self doubt, but they were pretty quickly forgotten. And him falling to despair in ch5 was not only a normal reaction that was shared by his friends, but it was also quickly forgotten and didn’t impact him that much.

Point is, his appeal is not in his non-existent “”””””””””arc”””””””””””

You don’t need an arc or development to be a good character. Shuichi is freakin awesome without needing any of that. You don’t have to point out something like an arc that really doesn’t exist only to justify liking a character or calling it well-written.

No, Shuichi is amazing on his own. The way he holds his own in stuff like scrum debates and rebuttal showdowns is pretty engaging. And how he always solves crimes is so incredibly fun to watch. He truly lives up to his title of Ultimate Detective.



#Number 2: Hajime Hinata

Hajime...feels like...a character study. An experiment held to see what would happen if you place an *actual* talentless individual in a killing game. Not like Makoto who had his luck and later on, his hope. But like, an actual talentless guy.

Hajime is a nobody. A nameless average joe with no special or unique qualities. He’s not particularly good at anything and he doesn’t stand out all that much. In fact, he’s completely bland. All of this is beautifully conveyed in his character design.


Why am I bringing attention to all this? Because hajime is fully aware of the his cruel, miserable existence and is at constant denial of it.

A closer analysis at his dialogue can reveal a much more forceful and upfront attitude compared to his predecessor, Makoto.

I believe most of you are aware that the “Yo” in the ever so famous “Sore wa chigau Yo!” is replaced by a “Zo” in order to express a more forceful or aggressive version of the famous phrase.

Why is that? Why is hajime, a person aware of his worthlessness be oozing with confidence?

It’s all a facade. A disguise. A mask. A lie.

Hajime isn’t some knight in shining armor. Hajime is a coward. Always has his guard up. Always afraid of confronting reality and instead choosing to run away from it. Hence why he joined Hope’s peak. To give himself the illusion that he’s worth something and feed into his denial, rather than confront reality.

That’s why he went along with the project and became Izuru Kamakura. Because he knew deep down that he’ll be a nobody for all his life.

That’s why Hopeman put him in a simulation. To give him a second chance.

And that’s why A.I. Junko came in. To try and ruin everything ~~including the quality of the writing but that’s beside the point~~

Then at the end of SDR2, he is confronted with a choice. To either wake up as a criminal and forget his life in the simulation, or continue living in blissful ignorance.


In other words, to confront reality (albeit a different one this time around) or remain in denial for the rest of his life. Mirroring his state of mind when he joined Hope’s peak.

And then....dues ex machina...

To be honest, this is the hardest thing to defend and is probably why he’s number 2 instead of being at the top like in many people’s lists.

But I digress.

Back to topic. Instead of hajime picking a choice, he comes to the realization that it doesn’t have to be this way.

Maybe the cruel reality isn’t as cruel as people make it out to be?

Maybe he’s not doomed to be stuck to a specific path?

But even so...

Even if the present is harsh. That doesn’t mean he can’t shape his future.

Just because reality is cruel, doesn’t mean he can’t create his own future. His own reality.

“The future isn’t a path, it’s like an endless sea...You can try to go anywhere...But it doesn’t mean you’ll get there. Even so, I will keep on living. I will keep on living as Hajime Hinata”

“My future...lies here”

So yeah, I kinda like Hajimeme.



#Number 1: Makoto Naegi

Makoto at the top. Shocker, I know.

To absolutely nobody’s surprise, Hopeman himself has made it to the top.

Why do I like Makoto?

I actually have two answers, believe it or not.

Old answer: There’s not much to it, to be honest. I just really like a well written goody-two-shoes.

Current Answer: Not too different from the old answer except I was starting to feel unsatisfied with saying just that. I knew deep down that there was more to Makoto and I’d never feel satisfied until I realize what it is. Sadly, my constant pondering was always met with unsatisfying answers until one day...

I discovered something known as a “Flat Character Arc”

In October 28, 2016, K. M. Weiland published a book titled “Creating Character Arcs”

The book in question explains that there three types of character arcs.

The Positive Arc: the one everyone is familiar with. The one where a character starts weak but slowly grows and develops and become better people. Think Hajime.


The negative arc: the complete opposite of the arc. It’s where someone starts out great but slowly develops into a terrible person. Think Goku Black.

And finally...

The Flat Character Arc: Unlike previous two, this is the arc where a character doesn’t go through any change or development. They start out and finish the story and remain almost the same without a lot of changes.

This is the arc where you see a character’s beliefs being always challenged.

What makes this one so compelling is that rather than having the main character going through change, *they’re* the ones changing others around them.

Sounds familiar?

Typically speaking, in the positive arc, there’s a student and mentor figure.

In said arc, we always see things from the point of view of the student.

The Flat character arc on the other hand, flips the perspective completely and shows us things from the point of view of the Mentor.

Imagine if we had a Naruto special starring Kakashi. Or a DBZ episode all about Master Roshi. It’d be so awesome.


So how does Hopeman fit into all this?

Well, do I need to bring up that gee, I dunno, he fucking took down Junko motherfucking Enoshima by always sticking to his beliefs and *never* chabging?

Contrary to popular belief, DR1’s main theme is *NOT* Hope vs Despair. It’s Trust vs Distrust. Hence why the beta version was called “Distrust”.

The one thing Makoto was trying to do all along was not install “hope” but “trust”. Meanwhile, Junko was attempting to install “Distrust” among the class.

Time and time again it was shown it was that distrust was the downfall of many students.

Sayaka should’ve trusted Makoto instead of trying to take the easy way out.

Mondo should’ve trusted that Fujisaki and others wouldn’t think less of him after learning his secret and that surviving this whole ordeal is way more important than having some dumb secret exposed.

Yamada should’ve trusted that Taka doesn’t bear any ill will towards Alter Ego.

And of course, everyone should’ve trusted that Ogami wasn’t a spy (even though she actually was) and should’ve suspected that it was way too sudden for Monokuma to suddenly drop a bombshell like that. They should’ve immediately known that he’s just trying to stir tension but **THE CAST OF DR1 IS SO FUCKING DUMB I CANT STAND IT UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**

Ahem, ahem. Sorry about that. That...won’t happen again.

Let’s not forget best girl kirigiri’s trust in Hopeman completely paid off.

Do I even need to mention that if you don’t trust Kirigiri during Ch.5’s trial and expose her lie you’d get the bad ending?


So yeah, I kinda like Makoto.





If you have any questions, lemme know! Make sure to remain civil in the comments.

[Spoilers MT] First glimpse into Malazan A year ago I decided to read Midnight Tides before any other Malazan book, because I heard that it could be read as a standalone and would give me a good idea of whether or not I should buy the other 9 books.

I’ve never read anything in my life that would print images in my mind in such an intense way. I still think and sometimes have dreams about the savage invasion of Letheras, the wizard’s (Kuru Khan?) last stand against the sea monster, the Crippled God’s island, the battle in the ice, the undead girl and the creatures in the cemetary, the merchant’s suicide, the princess savage assassination, Tehol and Bugg’s endless arguing and disgusting food... Some of these plot points I could not really understand, but the intensity of the story made up for the confusing bits.

I don’t know how to describe it, but this book has really messed with my brain. More than GoT, WoT or any of Gemmel’s books has ever done. I guess it’s the perfect balance between great prose, good worldbuilding and extremely intense action that did it for me.

All this to say that I am about to start GotM and read the whole thing in the proper order in 2019. Exciting months ahead, I’m sure!

Post-Fires Of Heaven Predictions \[Obviously tons of spoilers through Fires of Heaven\]


I did this before ([My predictions from after Shadow's Rising](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/av9cry/finished_shadow_rising_some_predictions/)) but now I've finished Fires of Heaven and I have more predictions to make! If the past is any guide (which in this subreddit it sure should be) they will be, eh, sorta right sometimes!


Though I know I'm doing this at my own risk, please don't spoil beyond cryptic "Hmmmm, so THAT's what you think" or things like that.


This time I'm going to make predictions in pairs: a broader, easier guess (maybe even about themes or super-vague plot directions)  (Easy) and a more specific one that I can't weasel around if I get it wrong (Hard).


* WOw It's sO LUcky RAnd cOULd rEvIvE A thIrd Of thE cAst cOnsEqUEncE frEE UsIng A wEApOn MOrAInE wArnEd hIm EvEn thE fOrsAkEn fEArEd. **The specific terrible consequences will include**:
   * Easy: Horn of Valere no longer bount to Mat, since it's bound for life, and he died. (I feel like a close reading of his red door scenes would give more insight but I didn't bother).
      * Hard: The Horn of Valere will fall into some evil person's hands and then the protagonists will smugly think they can't blow it and then WHOOPS they do.
   * Easy: Aviendha will find out and be super-disturbed. Probably nightmares and existentialism. Aviendha really keeps getting the short end of the stick so far (including the short end of Rand's stick Hey-o!).
      * Hard: Mat and Aviendha will both have some kind of Final Destination stuff going on, the weave trying to repair itself via their gruesome deaths and only being fought off with difficulty by Ta'Veren shenanigans.
   * Easy: Rand will be encouraged by this success to use balefire again explicitly to reverse a misfortune and it will be a disaster.
      * Hard: This disaster or failure will trigger a complete identity crisis or other form of madness.
* Easy: Moraine and Lanfear are both alive. I mean, come on. Right? Don't tell me Moraine the Blue ain't gonna pull a Gandalf the White.
   * Hard: They will both strike bargains with the beings within the door that will leave them more powerful and dangerous, and specifically give Lanfear another shot at love.
   * Hard: Lanfear was the one Asmodean saw in his last scene (and yeah he's really dead).
* Easy: Min and Rand have no substantive reason to be attracted to eachother - it's just some weird wheel harmonics because they're both attuned to the wheel in complementary ways.
   * Hard: They'll have to bang it out to realize this.
* Easy: Morgase will abdicate the throne to her daughter because she'll be unable to regain the trust of her people after her Forsaken groupie phase.
   * Hard: Somebody, Gawyn I'm gonna guess, will contest the transition of power.
* Easy: Shaido. Shadow. Shaido. Shadow. Hmmmm.
   * Hard: The Shaido will team up with a Forsaken under the leadership of Kaladin's ambitious wife.
   * Hard: The Shaido will all have been dark friends the whole damn time! Black Ajah style.
* Easy: The white tower schism subplot will remain tedious.
   * Hard: A cure for stilling will be discovered, and conveniently two people who need curing, Siuan Sanche and Logain, are in the same place ready to whoop some ass when they regain their powers!
   * Hard: Elaida and the white tower in exile will reconcile relatively peacefully - likely even at swordpoint but without a pitched battle - in the face of greater threats.
   * Hard: Above will happen because one of the protagonists will reveal the black Ajah presence.
* Easy: The motif of romance across age gaps will continue.
   * Hard: Mat will take this to an extreme when he unwittingly bangs a Forsaken.
* Easy: The Forsaken's general strategy of indirect engagement will be clarified: When they fight Rand they fight the Wheel itself, so luring him into exposing himself to the taint, or trying to seduce him, or buying time while the seals erode is their only choice. If four of them had attacked on the docks instead of just Lanfear the end would have been just as bad for them and that (plus mistrust) is why they don't just ambush him, or something like that.
   * Hard: At some point around Tar'mon Gaidon Rand will explicitly lose this Wheel protection - he'll be just an ordinary super-wizard with tons of ultrapowerful artifacts instead of "the one".

Never made it passed Path of Daggers...should I try and re-read it or skip to Winter's Heart? So I use to read a lot, and I don't do it as much these days. I loved the first set of WOT books but honestly I got really bogged down with The Path of Daggers. I didn't enjoy reading it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to finish the books before the series airs (if and when that happens), but honestly would you recommend starting The Path of Daggers again or just reading the synopsis online, then starting the series again by reading Winter's Heart?

&amp;#x200B;

Also it's been about 14 years since I tackled The Path of Daggers lol!

Thanks.

Questions about the pace of series and some events in books - Minor Spoilers

I started reading WoT 20 years ago.

I was in the army, and a fellow soldier read the series. I remember borrowing the books from him, and thought that I had read all the way to book 6 or 7 before I gave up. I remember that I thought progress was to slow at that point + my year in the army was over.




Now I Have started reading the series again, (just started book 3) and I can't really remember anything beyond book 1.




I remember parts of book 1, but not the ending. I don't remember anything from book 2. So now I am thinking that maybe I didn't read as much as I thought, or perhaps I have just forgotten almost everything.




So I have two questions:

The first one is about how much I will enjoy the series and the second is about the few event that I actually remember from my last reading.




1: I am a little concerned about sticking with the series all the way to the end. Already I find a lot of the descriptions tedious and unnecessary.

I do however love the world and the overall story. The end of book two is a definitive high for me at this point. So the question is: If I found the first half of book two slow and mildly interesting, and the end of book two is what I like the most – will I see a lot of that kind of action/pace in the rest of the series? Or is it just downhill from here?

&gt;!2: spoilers:!&lt;

&gt;!These are some events that I remember from the series, can you tell me if they are actually from WoT and if so: from what book they are in? !&lt;

&gt;!1. Rand and Egwene travel through the Waste with Aiel. The sun makes Rand very dark-skinned while Egwene only gets a sunburn. They clean themselves in some sort of sauna-tent. !&lt;

&gt;!2. Matt and/or Perrin travel on a boat for a long journey along the coast!&lt;

&gt;!3. Several characters (At least Matt, Rand and/or Perrin) visit an (abandoned?) tower or something similar where they meet someone who trains them in weapons or/ and give them some artifacts? This memory is very vague… I remember an image of a stone tower in a green wooden landscape. !&lt;

Finished the other day I started reading the series near the end of last June. It’s been an amazing ride for the past almost 9 months. It’s still so shocking to me that it’s over. What do I do with my life if I can’t read about new Randland adventures?

I think my favorite part of towers and aMoL was the amazing relationship between Androl and Pevara. They’re definitely my OTP for the entire series. Plus they’re both awesome characters on their own, and even better when they’re together.

So, I need book recommendations. I’ve got a long list of books I want to read now that I’m done with WoT, but it doesn’t hurt to add more lmao

Daily Readings of the WoT on Facebook LIVE I've been considering starting my days off by reading a couple chapters out loud LIVE on a Facebook page dedicated solely to readings of the WoT. I've been thinking about it for a couple months now, but since I don't know that I would be reading in different voices for the different characters, do you think anyone would be interested?

This idea started because my wife and I are reading the series out loud to one another (this is my 5th time through and her 1st) and she has a lot of questions, we enjoy discussing some of the issues and events, and it is just fun reading them out loud.

I'd definitely suggest that people ask questions while I'm reading and I would try to answer them at the end of each chapter without spoiling too much.

Thoughts? Concerns? Doubts? Snark?

A book reader's vernacular for the upcoming TV adaptation (Spoilers all) So, inspired by  [u/DiceToss](https://www.reddit.com/user/DiceToss)'s earlier post about balefire'd support characters, I figured we should sit down and come up with other WoT vernacular for what we expect to see in the TV additions (please add to this list!)

* Balefire - verb - To remove a character or event completely from the show narrative as if it never existed.
* Slayer - noun - a character that is an amalgamation of two or more book characters. (See also Isam.)
* Portal Stoned - a setting in the show that is but a weak facsimile of what was described in the novels.

Just Finished Knife of Dreams...I'm going to miss Robert Jordan's beautiful writing His prose and writing style, even though at times overly descriptive, just flowed so beautifully and was so immersive that I really felt like I was in the scenes when he was describing them. I'm going to be nervously smoothing my skirts in hopes that Sanderson can live up to the challenge in these last 3 books.

Some thoughts on Kinfe Of Dreams:

I absolutely loved it. Every dangling minor story line from the "slog" seems like it was wrapped up nicely and we can begin the march to Tarmon Gai'don with very few story lines hanging out there to distract from it.

[I fucking Knew Taim was one of the Foresaken](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/aqkyt4/just_finished_lord_of_chaos_spoilers_up_to_loc/). That's the only explanation for that final scene in the Epilogue with Pevara and the whole "Let the Lord of Chaos Rule" line. He has to be Demandred. And Rand trying to take apart his Black tower is going to be a very bloody affair.

Galina got the perfect punishment. Spending the rest of her days as Therava's whipping girl is exactly what she deserves. The battle at Malden was really well written. I was happy to see the surprise appearance of Tam to lead the two rivers men. All in all, I don't know if the battle was worth the 3 book wait to get there, but I'm glad its settled and they can move those characters forward.

Elayne continues to be my least favorite of Rand's three. I'm happy she is queen now because Andoran politics was absolutely the low point for me of the last 2 books, but jesus christ she got 3 sisters killed by running willy nilly into the night to try and capture 2 black sisters. I need some more Aviendha in the next couple books, she's my favorite of Rand's 3.

My boy Mat is finally married to the bloody daughter of the nine bloody moons. His chapters, as always, stood out above the rest for me. I think I probably just relate to him as a character more than anyone else in the series. I'm really looking forward to his adventure to the Tower of Ghenji with Thom and Noal. Mat saving another Aes Sedai and promptly getting 0 thanks from Moiraine is going to be great. I just wish Robert Jordan could have been the one to write the prose.

I am really looking forward to read the scenes with Cadsuane and Semirhage. That's going to be an epic battle of wits. I have a feeling Cadsuane isn't going to be able to break Semirhage. Rand really should have just walked up and bale fired her and been done with it. There is 0% chance that Semirhage actually stays in captivity these next 3 books.

Last but not least it was nice to see Suroth get taken out by being made de'covale. Whether she stays that way or not is yet to be seen, but with Semirhage captured its doubtful any of the other foresaken step up and set her free since she is basically a piece of property at this point and would no longer have any influence.

That's all I have for now, I'm excited to be another book closer to the last battle.

Are the characters in Wheel of Time interesting/engaging? Hi guys. Thinking about reading WoT at some point in the future, and I've read all the criticism and praise I could find about it. I had one unresolved question though: how are the characters? Are they engaging, interesting, do they demonstrate growth and change throughout the series, etc. or are they more just overpowered, static, Mary Sue sort of archetypes that plow their way through the story?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Anyone ever read Worm/Parahumans? I have a couple buddies who all share similar interest in books and recommend books to each other and discuss them.  One of them told us about Worm by John C McCrae which is an online novel.  Now we've all read it and it is amazing!

I literally could not stop reading this.  I read all of WoT in about 10 months (4 mil words) and I went through Worm in about one month (1.7 mil).  The characters are all great and the action never stops.

I've never seen it mentioned anywhere though.  I've read most of the big fantasy series out there, but have never seen any list of best series that includes this one.  Anyone ever read it or heard of it?

(Spoilers All) Bizarre dream last night re-imagining the series. So, last night, I had this weird dream for whatever reason where I was living out the Wheel of Time series as an omniscient character alongside everyone. I was able to be at every viewpoint and the dream went from the first chapter of book 1 all the way to the ending chapter of the third book.

&amp;#x200B;

 Here's the weird part...they were re-imagined as if it was in modern day. Most of the dream is forgotten for me already, but two parts that stand out for me are:

 1) Lan, Moraine, Egwene, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Thom in an SUV speeding own the road through red lights in an SUV while a biker gang of people with horned helmets (Trollocs) are chasing them and Fades are traveling in faster, sleeker cars. Lan was still calling Rand "sheepherder" however.

&amp;#x200B;

 2)  Tear from the Dragon Reborn was re-imagined as this crazy modernized military base and Callandor was a briefcase with nuclear launch codes or something, I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

 This dream really was bizarre and I woke up this morning wondering what in the hell my subconscious was up to for that to have happened. Anyone else have any weird stories/dreams like that or possible ideas for a modern WoT that could fit into my dream?

After 3rd book: Thoughts, Questions and Disappointments Hi everyone I just completed the 3rd book of WoT. I have lots of things to say.  All of them below are my humble opinions I don’t want to say bad things maybe just I am missing somethings and it is my fault.

THOUGHTS
First of all, I had high expectations about WoT before this series I have read GoT,LOTR, riftwar saga etc. People said to me WoT is the one of the greatest but until now I don’t feel like that.

Since I did not feel excited all the time I finished 3 books in such a long time and maybe that’s why I feel in this way. I have decided to share my feelings about the series and get some thoughts from the community here.

DISAPPOINMENTS
The general universe is great it is really different than cliches. Apart from this main story or better to say things that are happening is so predictable. Roughly said, main characters having trouble, they fall apart, they get together somehow, a war happening between them and “bad characters” and Rand “kills” Ba’alzamon. Nobody dies from main characters even Thom Merillin. So this predictable things are boring me. Maybe flow is not so predictable during the book but the end is so obvious.

QUESTIONS
Based on my knowledge,  Ba’alzamon is Ishamael but why at the end of every book, if I remember correctly ( at least 2 out of 3) Rand thinks or kills (cause I dont know if this time is real or not) Ba’alzamon? Isn’t it kind of same things for almost every end of the books?

How this easy Rand could kill the Ba’alzamon eventhough he is not aware of his power at least he can’t use all of it?

Moiraine said Be’lal is incredibly powerful compared to Moiraine she said she trained and if they can sneak next to Be’lal she could have chance. They sneaked but it looked so easy to kill Be’lal for Moiraine. What am I missing? I think these kind of power comparings are not so  consistent. At one conversation they say enemy is extremely powerful they can got killed by a single finger move of enemy but then they beat enemy up so fast.

What happend Liandrin and other Dark Ajah Aes Sedais during the battle at Tear? Maybe it will be explained later but it does not make any sense I did not read even one sentence about this in the battle part. They were aiming something that I can’t remember now by gathering 13 Myrddraal but they did not do anything.

These are the things that I came up to my head now. These are my humble opinions as I said earlier. Looking forward to hear from you guys!

P.S: I am writing from phone and english is my second language so forgive me for my typos/mistakes

Checked out reading list... Long time lurker here...
I've taken quite a few reading suggestions from this page and am looking for another! Recently I've gone through:
-Malazan series
-WoT
-Mistborn
-Stormlight Archives
-Kings of the Wyld
-Kingkiller Chronicles

I'd love to find something Kingkiller-esque, that won't make me wait an indefinite period of time to see the series finished.
Would love suggestions from you all! Thanks

(No spoilers) Dear WoT fans. I am trying hard not to run into any spoilers. Where can I read a fairly thorough summary of each book I have already read? I am working my way through the Wheel of Time series, and I am really enjoying it. However, the books are long and complex, and my pacing is slow.

I am going to start on the next book, and I would really appreciate it if anyone had a link to a summary of the previous books. Just so I am sure I can remember everything and all (or most) of the characters.

Last time I looked up a summary, the one for book 4 contained a major spoiler that was first revealed a book or two later. I really don't want that repeated again, so I am coming here for help.

I am sorry if there is already stickied information and wiki entries here and what not, but I dare not look.

Dashiva (Spoilers TPOD) I'm listening to the audiobooks after a couple of failed attempts at reading through the series when I was younger. I generally listen on the drive in and out to work, so i'm not always fully paying attention to what's happening, and there are a hell of a lot of names of people and places, so I use the encyclopaedia WOT to recap what i've listened to every so oftejn.

I find this really helpful, but it does spoil things every now and then in the footnotes.

I've just seen Dashiva referred to as Aginor in the footnote for the chapter where he weaves a ard against eavesdropping and talks to Rand about how "Strange": Saidin is near Ebu Dar, and i'm a bit confused about when (or if) it was actually confirmed that Dashiva is Aginor. I accidentally stumbled across a post here recently where someone said something about Dashiva and "Knowing tha Dashiva is Agnior makes it even more interesting", which was a big spoiler for me at the time

I guess my question is, is it actually confirmed by this point that Dashiva is Aginor, or is that revelation still to come? If it hasn't been expliicitly revealed yet, have I been missing bug hints?!

I'm not quite finished Path of Daggers yet, Rand has just used Callandor against the Seanchan and accidentally killed his own men, so no spoilers past that point if possible please!

Stop Trashing Brandon Sanderson's WoT Books Good day everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished rereading the entire series for the second time and took to the internet to see how people rank all of the WoT books. I have noticed that many people rate *Towers of Midnight* and *A Memory of Light* extremely low while slightly more love is given to *The Gathering Storm*. Some people disregard these books to the point that they go so far as saying that these books are not part of the "Canon" (pretentious much?) and should not even be considered. I created this post on reddit to air my views to the contrary. I completely understand that there is no such thing as objective book rankings or ratings as people generally read fiction purely for entertainment and people like what they like. With that said, I think the good people of the internet and WoT lovers should stop flaming Branden Sanderson and the books he finished for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Robert Jordan wanted someone else to finish the series when he died and made extensive notes so that someone could do so. To all the haters who rank the last three books so low because they view themselves as WoT "purists", get off your high horses of nerd righteousness and remember that you are reading fiction. People should take a moment to consider the process of writing an epic fantasy series, and then consider how difficult of a task Branden Sanderson was given. While mistakes were made and there are definitely some plot holes, especially in *A Memory of Light*, I personally think Branden Sanderson, all things considered, did an incredible job finishing the series.

2.) The list of fantasy authors who have failed miserably at wrapping up their **own** book series is extensive. I want to stay focused on WoT for this post, so I am not going to list any examples here. However, anyone who has read significant epic fantasy knows this to be true.

3.) I love Wheel of Time or I would not have read the entire series a second time. However, while the series as a whole is spectacular, there is also some boring, irrelevant reading in the books written by Jordan himself. Outside of the ending of Winter's Heart (no spoilers), books 8-10 are actually, in my humble opinion, trash. It was hard to get through large stretches of these three books (*The Path of Daggers, Winter's Heart, Crossroads of Twilight*) the first time and downright agonizing the second time around. I think the last three books written by Brandesn Sanderson, despite their differences, are far and away better than some of Robert Jordan's writing, most notably the three books just mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

There is more to say, but I will stop here to avoid what some people would end up deeming as rambling. Give some respect to Branden Sanderson and thank him for finishing the series we all love. I personally would much rather have an ending done by a different author than no ending at all. On the same not, let's all take a moment to pray that Mr. Martin hurries his ass up.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't look like people are too active here anymore which I completely understand, however please comment if you have read the books as I would love to hear what other people have to say.

Speculation abou the TV Show Hello dear WoT fans. I havent read the books but i have heard that a Amazon Prime TV show is coming. Do you think it will work? How many seasons do you think it would take to finish the story? What do you think?

"The slog" and its impact (no direct spoilers, but I am discussing the series as a whole).... I want to ask this question specifically of folks who started the WOT after it was finished (or at least post Knife of Dreams) since you had the books in question to read in succession without waiting for them to be published.

When you were introduced to the series, did whoever did so (or however you found out about it) make reference to "the slog" of books 7 (or 8) to 10?  If so, how did this impact your perception of the series/these books when you got to them?

I will freely admit that 8-10 are the weakest of the series and probably could have been 1-2 really strong books; that said, I wonder if we are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy by blatantly stating 3 (or 4) of the books in the series are incredibly boring and are just a miserable experience you need to wade through.

Which Cosmere book do you think would be the best for a movie or TV show? I think Alloy Of Law would be great. It’s pretty self-contained story wise, and the characters are all lovable (I’d also love to see Wayne on the big screen)

I feel that Era 1 would be misinterpreted by the director and they’ll go for the dark and gritty movie with super low contrast. I want Mistborn’s world to be fun to look at, and not another “sad grey and black dystopia”

I think Stormlight is just too epic in scale to be properly adapted to a movie. They would have to cut out so much of Kaladin’s arc with Bridge 4 (at least in TWoK) that his story would be less compelling. And Shallan’s story in TWoK would have to be so short that you might question why they include it anyway. Stormlight would be better as a big-budget TV show (like GoT or WoT)



What do you guys think?

Books 8-10 Question Just finished book 7 A Crown of Swords and am nervous about moving on to book 8, that was where I stopped 10 years ago when I first picked up the series, I just got bored by the storyline back then and couldn't find the energy to keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to make it through to the end of the series but looking at the reviews for book 8 on Audible it feels almost like I could read the cliff notes of the book and move on? Obviously this is the WoT subreddit so I'm assuming most of you will think that blasphemy, so I guess I'm looking for some encouragement that books 8-10 will be worth the slog?

Epic Wheel of Time moment NB! Spoilers for WoT 13 below!

I had an awesome experience while reading today. On Mondays and Tuesdays I work on the other side of the country, so I have a lot of reading time. As my train neared my hometown today, I was reading chapter 41 of book 13 in WoT. This is my first read through and I usually switch between audible and reading them on my Kindle. Luckily, today I was reading my Kindle and listening to music on my phone. In this chapter, [spoiler] (/s"Perrin travels to help the Whitecloaks who are overwhelmed in an ambush of Trollocs. As Perrin rides for Galad"), my music played [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=FZNqs0YgWkM&amp;t=4m10s).

It was all so epic. I was completely immersed in the book, barely noticing the music, imagining [spoiler] (/s"Perrin Goldeneyes riding through a wave of Trollocs to save Whitecloaks, and then I noticed the music. As the battle") became as epic as it could be, the music of LOTR hit me and it all became a sweet mixture of grand adventure and nobelness.

So, if you are ever reading chapter 41 of book 13 in WoT, I highly recommend listening to LOTR music!

Just had to share as it was so awesome and my friends who I usually share stuff like this with haven't read as far as me yet.

Tl;dr: My music and my reading lined up perfectly to create one awesome moment of pure reading joy.
