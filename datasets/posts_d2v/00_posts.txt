The Turtle, the Crab, and the Shell of Whispers There once was a gentle fisherman named Horace who lived with his wife, Mary, off the coast of PEI. Every morning, Mary would wake up first, head to the kitchen and prepare her husband’s breakfast: two eggs, fried ham, with a side of homemade bread and blueberry jam. While she cooked, Horace would rise slowly, then shower. He would sit, eat, kiss his wife goodbye, then head out to his small fishing boat before the sun rose.

He was a fourth-generation fisherman, so even though he was alone and never caught many fish, he knew the right spots to at least always catch something. He always finished his day with two fish for him and Mary, and enough to sell in town to pay for whatever they couldn’t grow or make themselves. While Horace was out fishing, Mary would bake bread, clean, feed their chickens, and tend their garden. Their lives were simple and humble, but it was enough for them. They were content.

One morning, Horace pulled in his net to find a large, beautiful, white sea turtle trapped inside.

“Well I’ll be!” he exclaimed, “This will sell for enough to set us up right nice I think.” And began to set to task freeing up the turtle from the net.

“Oh please don’t!” a small voice cried.

Horace stopped and looked around. “Who’s there?”

“Me! The poor innocent soul that’s bound for market.” The turtle then began to wail miserably, lamenting everything she would never be able to do after she’d been butchered and sold for soup.

Horace, always having been uncomfortable with the weepings of the fairer sex, coughed and shifted from one foot to another.

“Well now…” he mumbled, running a hand through his hair nervously. “I suppose I couldn’t possibly bring a talking turtle to town. If I went and claimed you were of the talking sort, they’d think I was touched in the head.” His brow wrinkled, “And if I didn’t say anything, my conscience would hurt something fierce knowing.”

“Oh yes, please don’t sell me. I would be ever so grateful. You see, I’m not a normal sea turtle.”

“Yes, I can rightly see that clear enough without you saying so.” He was starting to get unsettled. After all, talking to a turtle isn’t exactly something someone does on a regular day.

“No, you don’t understand. I’m actually not a sea turtle at all, but a water faerie, and I’ll give you a gift if you would just free me back into the sea.”

Horace pondered a moment. If he brought the turtle to town, he’d be guaranteed a large pay. He could buy Mary a new dress, himself new boots, and heck, he might even end up in the newspaper. He’d be the talk of the town for generations. But on the other hand, a gift from a faerie was hard to pass up.

He nodded once. “It’s a deal then. Let’s shake on it.” He reached down through the net and shook the turtle’s flipper.

Once she was safely back in the water, she poked her head above the waves.

“Go to the cave in the gully south of here and find a blue crab.” She said. “When you find him, tell him I sent you and you’re to have as many whispers as you can handle.”

“What do you mean by whispers?” He asked, but she was already gone. “Well! I don’t think Mary will believe a word of this, I certainly wouldn’t! Too much sun I’d say.”

He paused, thinking. He knew which cave the turtle had mentioned, and it wasn’t *that* far… It wouldn’t take long to just take a look. And besides, he’d caught enough for supper, and a little detour wouldn’t hurt anything, would it?


---------------------------------------------------


The cave could only be accessed during low tide, causing it to be in a constant state of dampness. As the current moved out, it left behind small clams, mussels, and crabs. Walking the sand and rocks was made difficult by the slippery seaweed.

Horace lit his old lantern and began the journey inwards. He kept his eyes on the ground to both mind his steps and to see if he could spot the blue crab he was seeking. By the time he reached the back of the cave, his shirt clung to him and his feet hurt from balancing on the rocks.

Defeated, he turned to leave but hesitated. “Ah… um…” He cleared his throat. “Is there… Is there a blue crab about? I was told to come find you.” He said this quietly, feeling self-conscious.

“What? What what? What’s this then?” A gruff voice appeared behind him. “Lookin’ fer me then, are ye? Ha! Can’t even see the blast nose on yer face in here. Over here, no here man! Use yer eyes!” Horace turned towards the sound and raised his lantern in search. Finally, after much instruction from the strange voice, he spotted something reflect the light near the cave wall. Bringing the lantern closer, Horace saw a very small blue crab.

“Well now!” Horace said. “That sea turtle wasn’t lying, that’s for sure.”

“Sea Turtle?” The crab snapped its claws. “Damn that white trickster. She’s sure got sea foam fer brains tellin’ ye ‘bout me.”

Horace put his face close to the crab to get a better look.

“Well, you see I caught her in my net and she said she’s give me a gift if I let her go. When I did, she told me to come and find you. Said that I could “have all the whispers I could handle”. What that means, I don’t rightly know.”

The crab took a snip a Horace’s nose, making him flinch back.

“Mind me personal space man!”

The crab scuttled left and right, mumbling to himself. “Wot kind’r person gives a gift, then asks ye te give it te someone else. Ha! It’s mine, innit?” Finally, he stopped and snapped his claws sharply. “Fine! Fine fine. Fine I’ll let ye use me Shell. But be warned, human, mind yer words with the damned thing. Dennae come cryin’ if yer not happy.”

The crab retreated into a small hole in the cavern wall, returning quickly dragging a small white spiraled shell behind him.

Horace went to grab for it, but the crab kept him at bay, snapping wildly.

“Mind yerself man! Ye dennae know the rules yet. Now then,” he continued, “Like most Shells o’ Whispers, ye cannae ferget the water…”

“What’s a Shell of Whispers?” Horace interrupted.

“Wha..? What’s a….” the crab sputtered causing water bubbles to foam from his mouth. “What’s a Shell o’ Whispers?! Ye damned sea slug! How cannae ye not know about Shells o’ Whispers but still commin here takin’ mine? Humans… Ha!”

Horace, feeling quite ashamed of himself for being chastised by a crab, felt his ears and cheeks reddening.

“Well now,” Horace said shyly, “I can’t say I’ve ever seen one before. Come to think of it, I can’t say I’ve ever met a talking turtle and crab either, so I suppose I’m learning quite a few things today.”

“Right… Then I suppose I’ll tell ye.” The crab said, not unkindly, his agitation having been softened by Horace’s gentle manner. “Listen an’ listen well, human. A Shell o’ Whispers will grant whatever yer heart desires as long as ye follow the rules. Ye take the Shell, whisper to it yer wish, then place it in a bowl o’ sea water an’ head straight te bed. Come morn, the water will be gone an’ yer wish granted. Simple, yeh?”

Horace nodded eagerly.

“Now, here’s the rules. Rule One: Ye cannae tell anyone ‘bout the Shell. If ye do, all yer wishes’ll be undone an’ the Shell’ll break. Iffn that happens, I’ll be right mad at ye, ye hear!”

“Don’t tell anyone about the shell. Got it.”

“Not a word! They cannae even know it exists. Rule Two: Ye must wait till yer last wish comes te fruition before makin’ another. Be careful with this one, human, makin’ another wish before the last is done will end badly fer ye.”

“Only one wish at a time. Right then.”

The crab rested one claw on top of the shell. “Good. Rule Three: Iffn ye wake come morn an’ the bowl is still full o’ water, yer wish wasn’t granted an’ yer times up with it. Ye gotta bring it back here before days end. Ye hear? No more wishin’, an’ it comes here before dark. Plant that in yer head good an’ tight.”

“No more wishes if the bowl is full in the morning and to bring it back here right quick.” Horace nodded.

“How many wishes do I get then?”

“Up te the Shell, that is. Just dennae get greedy, mind, an’ dennae wish fer something unnatural like.”

Horace wasn’t sure what that last part meant, but he got the point. “What’s rule number four?” He prompted.

“Ain’t none. Just thems three.”

“Well then,” Horace smiled, “That sounds easy enough I’d say.”

The crab gurgled indignantly, “Ye would think it’d be easy, ye damned clam.” He mumbled. “Fine then, take it an’ be gone with ye!” With that, the crab scurried back into his hole, leaving the shell behind.

Horace gingerly picked it up and held it in his palm. It was a small, delicate little thing, and seemed to give off a soft white glow. He took out his handkerchief and wrapped the shell gently, placing it back in his pocket before making his way back to the mouth of the cave.

When he got close to the exit, he realized the tide had started to come in and it was dark out. He stood for a moment, puzzled. When he had entered the cave, it had been well before noon, and his conversation with the little crab couldn’t have taken more than 15-20 minutes. He looked back into the cave and scratched his head in confusion.

“Well now. Mary is going to be right mad with me, I think. Right mad indeed.” Horace sighed as he waded through the water, leaving the cave behind him.


---------------------------------------------------


Mary was beside herself by the time Horace entered the house carrying the couple of fish he’d caught that morning.

“Horace! Oh Horace!” She rushed to him giving him a kiss, holding his face in her hands, her own full of worry. “Horace, whatever happened? Why are you home so late? Are you hurt?”

Horace took hold of her hands and kissed them. “Mary, calm down Love. I’m fine.”

“Well then!” Mary gave a sharp slap to his arm, her face now red with anger. “What have you been doing while I’ve been here worried my dear husband has sunk his ship and is lost to the sea? Hmm? I walked over to old Hammond’s place, as I know you sometimes like to keep the poor man company and have a game of rummy before lunch, but he hadn’t seen hide or hair of you since last week. I went to town and asked Trevor and his father if they’d seen you, but they both said they hadn’t. No one had. I even checked the pub, of all places!”

“Mary, you’ll never believe…” he started, but then caught himself, remembering the crab’s warning. “Ah… that is, well now. I, ah, fell asleep.” He finished lamely.

Mary gave him a queer look. “You fell asleep?”

“Yes. Something, ah, just came over me and I just got so tired, so I told myself, “Horace, you should take a nap.” So I did.”

“And you slept all day?” She didn’t seem convinced.

“I suppose I did, didn’t I? I’m as surprised as you are, really. Maybe I’m coming down with something.”

Mary searched his face and sighed. “Well, supper’s ready. I suppose you’re a good deal hungry having missed lunch.”

“Absolutely famished.” Horace growled, pulled Mary close and gave her a sloppy kiss. She protested weakly, falling into a fit of giggles and swatting him away playfully.

“Go clean up, you cheeky bugger.” She teased, grabbing the fish from him before wandering back to the kitchen, chittering to herself and shaking her head.

Horace chuckled then went to lock himself in the bathroom. Looking in the mirror, he felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He had lied to Mary. He never lied to Mary. Granted, they never really had anything to lie about, but not once in their 20 years of marriage had Horace lied to her, nor her to him… at least to his knowledge.

“What are you doing, Horace?” He mumbled as he stared himself in the eyes. He went into his pocket and pulled out his handkerchief. The shell was still there, and looked even prettier in the light. It was so thin, it was almost translucent, letting you see the ridges inside the spiral.

“Supper’s on the table, dear. You want to eat it while it’s hot.” Mary called from the dining room.

“Coming!” He quickly rewrapped the shell and replaced it in his pocket, splashed a few handfuls of water on his face and toweled off before heading to eat.

Supper was left over fish stew from the night before. “This was supposed to be for lunch.” Mary explained, giving him a slightly miffed look. “I’ll put those two fish you brought in the smoker out back and we’ll eat them tomorrow.”

“Mmm, sounds good Love.” Horace smiled over at his wife, gazing at her fondly. He noticed the edges of her dress starting to fray, colors faded. Her hands were hard-worn from cleaning and working the garden. She had crow’s feet starting to appear in the corners of her eyes along with laugh lines around her mouth. She was nearing 40, but already had some silver streaking her dark brown hair.

By God, he loved this woman. They had met as teenagers and instantly knew they were meant for each other. Though they had married young, his life by her side had been pure bliss. She never had pretty clothes, or maids, or fine china, but not once had she ever complained. She married a fisherman’s son and knew the life would be hard, but she was a strong woman, and Horace loved her deeply for it. She had never had the life of luxury he’d always wanted to give her, but maybe now that could change. Looking over at his devoted wife, he made up his mind.

“Mary, that was delicious as usual. Thank you Love.” He stood and kissed the top of her head. “I’m going to step out for a bit. I’m realizing I forgot something on the boat.”

“Alright darling.” Mary flopped her napkin onto the table and started to clean up.

“Oh no, Mary. Let me do that tonight.” He said pulling the plates from her hands. “I put you through such a fright, you should have the night off from dishes.”

“You need to go to the boat though, Horace.” She protested. “It won’t take long. I’ll be done by the time you get back.”

“I’ll do it before heading down. Now go and sit with your book or needlework and put your feet up. I insist.”

Mary laughed. “Well if you insist I suppose I can’t say no, now can I?”

As Horace did the dishes, he stole glances to be sure Mary was settled in. Once done, he reached into the back of the cupboard, pulled out a small wooden bowl and discreetly tucked it under his shirt before heading for the door.

“I’m stepping out now, Mary. Be back soon.” He called.

“Don’t take any naps along the way, mind you.” She called back, a smile in her voice.

Horace closed the door and hurried down to his wharf on the beach. The waves crashed against the rocks nearby, sending a spray up into the air. A cool, crisp breeze was about and tugged at his hair. He took out the bowl and dipped it into the water, filling to the brim. He went up onto his boat, careful not to spill, and put the bowl on the counter in the cabin. Horace figured this was the safest place to keep it hidden as Mary never came on the boat. He just hoped she wouldn’t notice the missing bowl.

After surrounding the bowl with heavy things so that the bowl wouldn’t move about while the boat rocked, he took out the shell. It shone brightly in the moonlight, giving it a truly otherworldly appearance.

“Right then.” Horace wondered what to wish for. “Better give it a bit of a test run, eh? Best way to find out if the thing works. If it doesn’t, I won’t be too disappointed then, will I?”

He cupped the shell in his hand and brought it close to his face. Speaking very quietly, Horace whispered. “If you’re so inclined, tomorrow when I go out to fish I’d like to catch more fish than I ever have before, please.” Not knowing how he was supposed to end his wish, he simply whispered “Thank you kindly” and placed the shell into the bowl of sea water.

The shell floated for a moment, then sank to the bottom as water worked its way into the spiral sending tiny bubbles back up to the surface.

“Well now,” he watched, hands on his hips. “I suppose that’s that.”

Heading back to the house, Horace couldn’t help but wonder if he had gone mad after all, or if today really had been as magical as all that. Either way, he couldn’t wait to go to sleep and see what tomorrow would bring.


----------------------------------------------------------



When Horace woke up, he rushed through his routine anxious to check on the shell.

“Slow down, Horace. You’re going to choke for Pete’s sake.” Mary tsked at him. “What’s the big hurry this morning?”

“Nothing, Mary. Just feeling like today is going to be a good day, is all.” Horace got up, stole a kiss, then was out the door. He practically ran to the boat, his stomach full of butterflies.

When he entered the cabin, he saw the shell laying at the bottom of a completely dry bowl.

“Well I’ll be.” Horace couldn’t stop the grin from spreading on his face. “Today’s bound to be a good day, that’s for sure!”

After he arrived at his favorite spot, he launched his nets and waited. Suddenly, Horace heard a loud *smack* against the side of his boat.

Leaning over the edge, he shined a spot light to see what had hit the side.

*Smack* *Smack* Another, then another. He finally spotted the source of the noise. Fish were launching themselves against his boat.

“What the…?” Horace stared as the water began to boil. No, not boil, he realized, it was fish all kicking up near the surface. Hundreds of fish, more fish than he’s seen in his entire life. He quickly went to pull up his nets. The boat tipped from the weight and the winch creaked in protest, but he managed to haul them onto the deck. They were spilling over with fish. He couldn’t believe his eyes.

“By God, I’ve hit the mother-load!” He whooped and cheered as he dragged up as many fish as his ship could hold. Many managed to jump straight onto deck without any help. By the end of the frenzy, lasting no longer than 10 minutes, Horace could barely walk through the mass of flopping fish.

He brought two full loads to market, and still had plenty left over. The stall owners couldn’t believe their eyes. Before heading out to the next town over to unload the rest, Trevor, one of the younger stall keepers confided in Horace.

“I gotta say, Horace, I’m sure glad you caught something. No one else was able to catch anything at all today.” Trevor scratched his head. “I wonder what made them all go to one spot like that. Never heard of anything like it. Next time though, try to leave some for the rest of us.” He laughed.

“No guarantees, Trevor. No guarantees.” Horace laughed back as he set out for the next town.

After driving all morning delivering his massive haul to the neighboring towns, he learned that the story was the same in each port; There had been no fish all morning. Everyone had come up empty handed except for him. Many commented on his stroke of good luck, but Horace knew the real reason for this windfall. He picked up the finest cut of lamb he could find and some flowers for Mary, and headed home with a light heart and heavy pockets.

When he walked in the door, he swept Mary up in a hug and spun her around.

“Horace! What’s gotten into you?” She squealed in delight.

As she placed her flowers in a vase, he launched into the story of that morning, showing her all the money he’d made. It was enough to last them months. She was shocked but also thrilled, there were many things that needed repairing around the house and this would help immensely.

“Some of it we can use on the house, Mary, but I want you to take some and spoil yourself a little.” She agreed eagerly, and went about getting the lamb ready for supper.

The next day, Horace went back out wondering if he’d have a repeat of the day before, but it was clear fairly quickly that things had gone back to normal. Later in town Trevor confirmed it; the fish were back and it was bound to be a mystery the towns folk would be talking about for a while. When evening came, Horace wondered what to wish for next. As he filled the bowl of water he glanced at his boat. It was old, having served two generations before him. The paint was beginning to peel, and everything was rusty. He kept it as well maintained as he could, but it would need a miracle to get his boat in tip top shape.

Returning onboard, he held the shell close.

“Thank you for granting my request yesterday, little shell.” He whispered. “If it’s at all possible, I could really use a new boat. This one is older than I am, and costs more in repairs than she’s worth. Thank you very much.” Placing the shell gently into the water, he found it strange that he saw no air bubbles escape from it as it sank, but brushed it off.

When he left the house the next morning, he half expected to see a shiny new boat waiting for him. When he wasn’t greeted by such a sight, he felt slightly disappointed.

“Maybe it didn’t work.” he thought as he climbed onboard. “I suppose asking for a new boat is a tall order.” But when he entered the cabin, the bowl was once again bone dry.

“Well now, that’s quite a puzzle.” Shrugging, he went about his morning as usual.

When he got to town, he saw everyone talking together in the middle of the street. Trevor spotted him and waved him over.

“What’s all this now?” Horace asked, glancing around at the small crowd.

“Old man Hammond’s dead!” One man exclaimed.

“Andre’s niece, Julia, goes over twice a week to tidy up for him. Walked in and found him dead as a door nail.” Said another shaking his head sadly. “Poor thing’s had quite the shock.”

“What did it?” Horace asked reeling. He had just seen him last week for some cards and the man had seemed fit as a fiddle.

“Drowned, in his own tub she said. The man wasn’t young by any means, but there’s certainly better ways to go.” Many nodded their heads at this.

“Who’ll take care of the funeral?” Horace rubbed his eyes. “He had no family and wasn’t very well off as far as I know.”

“Dunno,” said Trevor, “he was a God-fearing man, so maybe the church? Someone should go speak to the pastor.”

“Well now, if the church can pay for some, I’ll chip in a share. We were friends, and it’s only right and fair that the man get a half decent funeral.” Horace proclaimed crossing his arms.

“Aye, I’ll help as well.” Said one man.

“Count me in as well, Horace.”

Though he was a quiet man, and only had a few friends, Hammond was well known around town as always being generous and kind. After much discussion, the crowd all agreed that everyone would pitch in as a way to honor this good man. The funeral was held a few days later and was a simple affair, which suited Horace just fine. Hammond wouldn’t have wanted a big ruckus.

As he and Mary left the service, they were approached by man they did not know. Looking at his clean, crisp suit, and sleek black briefcase, Horace knew for certain he was either a city boy or a lawyer. Or both.

“Mr. Whitaker? Mr. Horace Whitaker?” He man asked.

“That’s me, sure enough.”

The man nodded and shook Horace’s hand. “My name is Marcus Levi, I’m from Levi and Sons, up in Charlottetown. We handled all of Hammond Bentley’s affairs. You’ve been named in his will, so I would like to take a few minutes to go over the particulars, if that’s alright with you?”

“Hammond left me something?”

“Yes sir, a ship of some sort. I have all the paper work here, all you need to do is sign. She’s moored in town here. I’ll show you where.”

“Hammond left you his boat?” Mary looked at Horace with wide eyes. “He loved that boat like it was his own child. Wasn’t that so very sweet of him, he always was such a kind man, even till the end.” She brought her handkerchief to her eyes as she began to weep.

“There there, Mary. It’ll be alright. Head up to the house, I’ll come along shortly.”

Mary sniffled and excused herself.

It was a beautiful vessel, and Hammond must have repainted it no more than a month ago. It looked brand new and now it was his. A new boat, just like he’d asked for, and when Horace saw it he almost threw up from guilt.

He signed the papers in a daze, barely hearing what the lawyer was telling him, and scarcely remembered the trip as he sailed the boat home where he found Mary serving coffee to Trevor and his father.

“Horace,” Trevor’s father started, “We heard that Hammond left you his boat. Glad for you on that.”

Horace grabbed a cup and sat down heavily.

“Trevor and I came up here ‘cause we were thinking that seeing as you got yourself a new ship, that maybe you’d be willing to sell your old one to Trevor here.”

“You want to buy that hunk of junk?” Horace asked, surprised.

“Well, if you’re not going to be using it that is.” Trevor fidgeted with his mug. “I’ve been wanting to try my hand at fishing, see. I’d catch, and dad’ll sell. Makes us profit in the long run.”

“Fishing’s hard work, son. Not for the faint of heart.” Horace stared hard at Trevor. “But if you want her, she’s yours. Not worth the wood she’s made from, but we can come to an agreement of sorts, I’m sure.” He stood and motioned for Trevor to follow him. “Might as well show you how to drive her. Come on then.”

When they approached the boat, Horace went ahead. Once aboard, he quickly pocketed the shell so Trevor wouldn’t see it. He took the young man out for a quick sail, showing him the basics, and promised that the next day he’d teach him how to fish properly, just like his father had taught him. Once Trevor and his father had left, Horace told Mary he would be on the beach.

“I just need some time with my own thoughts, Love.”

“I understand, dear, it’s been a long day for all of us. You know I’m here if you want to talk.” She patted his cheek tenderly and went off to their bedroom to change.

On his way out, Horace grabbed the bottle of whiskey and two glasses. Sitting on the beach, he poured the drinks.

“Here’s to you Hammond. I always knew you cheated at rummy, but never said nothing ‘cause it was funny to watch you lose anyway.” He toasted and downed the golden liquid from both glasses.

By the time the sun was setting, Horace was more than halfway through the bottle. Grumbling, he fumbled around in his pocket and pulled out the shell.

“You killed him, didn’t you?” He slurred at the white spiral, fixing it with a drunken glare. “You killed him because I wanted a new boat, didn’t you?” His voice rising in anger. “Damn you! Damn you, you stupid hex!” Horace stood and wobbled in place, glaring at the shell in his hand. “All I wanted was to maybe improve things a little. That’s not a crime, is it? I was happy, with my life, with Mary, why did it matter if we had more money or a new boat? Hmm?”

He stood there, leaning heavily to one side, and waited for an answer. When he got none, he started stumbling towards the water. “I don’t know why I bothered with you at all. I had everything I ever wanted in my life before I got you.” At the edge of the water he paused and took a long swig of whiskey, his eyes falling on the old boat moored beside his new one.

He thought of Trevor, and how he was going to teach him to fish in the morning. Tears began to leak from the corners of his eyes. “Everything except a son to call my own.” He whispered to himself as he stared out at the ocean.

He wondered if his father would be proud of him, or disappointed the family lineage ended with him. He and Mary had tried of course, but they soon discovered Mary couldn’t bear children. They were devastated, but Horace loved her more than life itself and never once considered leaving her.

“I think that’s my only regret in life, you know, never holding my own flesh and blood in my arms… That and thinking something like you could make my life better.”

He belched and gazed at the glowing white form in his hand through bleary eyes. He snorted, took another drink of the bottle, cocked his arm back, and threw the shell towards the water. “To hell with you!” he cried as he watched the white spec disappear into the waves. After a few more swigs, he made his way slowly back home, collapsed into bed without so much as a good night to Mary, and dreamt of sea foam, crabs, and laughing turtles.

asked someone to use my new (old) name today AMAB. Just starting my questioning to figure out who i am, reading lots of new words yesterday.. who knows if I'm on the right subreddit but anyway big news for me.  Assigned a male name on my birth certificate. Assigned an androgenous nickname used since birth (kismet wot!) that I used until puberty-ish.  I remember disliking the teasing.
24 years ago today exactly (i saw it yesterday in time for this post. kismet?) [calvin sans hobbes said it best](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/03/28).  "That's a girls name" so I made everyone change it to the boy names.  i ran away from who I was, lacking acceptance, looking for it in all the wrong places because it was never going to be me that was accepting me.

So lately I've had this unrepressable urge to be called by my childhood androgynous perfect name.  Sometimes feeling like my current name is my deadname. I do not know if it's a permanent desire, it's new and sometimes things fade, and certainly almost everyone i know is not ready for it (but i"ve given thought to who might be trustable as early adopters of course...).  And I'm going to my first therapy session today (first since I was a child.. around puperty-ish.. these puzzles pieces just keep clicking) so I'm going to work on keeping the mental health I've got and have someone to talk to about everything and anything, so I can learn patience and strategy there.

So today I was impulsive and anyway I just started at a gym (orange theory), and it's only been a month but they say "Hi feelingsofwhite" everytime and after today I went up and was like "um, yeah, so my birth cirtificate and blahblahblah and anyway I go by feelingsofwhite sometimes, and I'd prefer that"  "you mean like on the emails and stuff?"  PANIC! THAT'S TRACEABLE EVIDENCE! ANYONE COULD SEE THAT THEN! "um, yeah, and like, yes please .... THANK YOU!!!"

a safe space with people who won't intersect with "the rest" of my life.  a nice little part of my life, where I can see what it feels like to be a different kind of me, associated with so many positive things (it took a long of mental work before I did the easy physical step of walking through a gym door)

I did it.

I really did it.

I asked someone to call me feelingsofwhite instead of feelingsofwhite.  It feels so new that i worry I'm just on a tangent.  It feels so old than most people who know me are just unaware of it.  If feels so familiar like a part of me that was always there.  It all just feels like feelingsofwhite

I love you all! Thanks for listening and stay fabulous!!  How about you? any new goals or little mini-steps?

Update of tower progress. (Before anything, I need help with the defense quest for 50 successful defenses, so If you guys can raid me and lose on purpose, that would be awesome, I only need like, 8 more. You don't need to drop me anything, just raiding is enough. Cheers you absolute legends. PSN-A_Bit_Too_Cheesy I'm australian btw, it'll probably help the search for me)
Hey guys, I'm back.
Few new things have happened in the last couple of weeks. First off, I have tier 5 fighters now, already got a shooter in the middle of the pack in my defenses, just to stop people from getting too high a raid score.
I have the kamas sp at +2, having a bit of trouble farming WE red because I didn't play during the WOT event. I've mainly been abusing the weekly boss quest and getting heaps of red metal that way, it feels safer and more realiable for now.
In terms of armour, I'm running a DOD set, just the DIY assult set for now, (helmet base, chest +3, pants +1) and I'll probably just rock it until something better rolls along.
Something I've noticed is just how powerful the drill arm is. I've got the 3 star drill at +2, and I'm able to melt all bosses under floor 32 (under 30 if using a  4 star fighter) when I use a striker. As far as I can tell, the r1/2 is absurdly powerful, being able to 5 shot floor 23 goto-9 with no shrooms, and at full health with the dumbell and raging bull decals. Don't get me wrong, compared to most weapons it isn't that impressive, but for a 3 star weapon that only apparently does 349 base damage, it's fucking rediculous.
Anyway, that's about it for now, I'll check back in when i hit floor 40 or some shit idk, I'll burn that bridge when I come to it.
(edit about the drill, completely forgot to mention its absurd speed for the r1/2 attack. It's faster than all weapon attacks I've seen so far, except for maybe the second attack in the machete chain and the timed attack of the chopper.)

Ever noticed that your GTI doesn't feel like it's really at "full" power when going WOT in 1st and 2nd? Get a diagnostic tool and turn off your "torque limiter" and "vehicle vibration reduction" whether you're tuned or not. It's is one of the best cheap mods one can make IMHO. When I installed the Stage 2 tune on my MK7 I was honestly let down by the lack of thrust in 1st and 2nd gear. It certainly didn't feel like a car with 340+WTQ. The car felt quicker when in 3rd on the freeway than when in 2nd on the streets. A friend and fellow MK7'er recommended disabling the "torque limiter" (reduces torque output in lower gears to prevent wheelspin) and "vehicle vibration reduction" (also throttles power when it anticipates wheel hop) with a diagnostic tool like VAGCOM/ OBDeleven etc. for more low end punch.

The difference is night and day! Finally there's legitimate feel-it-in-your-butt thrust in the first few gears all the way thru. And while one might assume that it'd turn their well behaved GTI into a torque steering maniac that is shockingly not the case (note that I do have the Performance Pack and the LSD that accompanies it though). As long as you have even respectable tires the wheel-spin isn't dramatic.

06 Ford Ranger auto - transmission shifts hard into second, bucks letting off in second. Highway speed throttle on/off noticeable My 2006 Ford Ranger V6 4.0 auto, I'm starting to notice a few transmission related points.

- If I am accelerating, particularly hard like on the highway (WOT at times), When I shift into 2nd it's a harder shift, and then shifting into 3rd is also hard.
- If I put the transmission in 2, if I am driving at speed holding 2nd, letting off the gas will give the truck a hard juke forward.
- on the highway in OD, if I am letting on/off the gas, I notice a little "nudge" at certain speeds like 70, like I've been pushed a bit in the back.  Maybe it's my mind racing from worrying about 2nd gear.
- there is no check engine light

History - bought truck at 60K, has 96K on it now.  Changed transmission fluid/filter at 66K (change - not flushed).  PO said it was changed before but can't trust it that much.

Wondering if a flush is the way to go here, and if I should've done a flush before (I've always read mixed reviews on flushes).

Also wondering what this 2nd gear issue means for me - if it's a problem that can be addressed, or if I should ready for a full rebuild/replacement.  I've never had transmission problems in any of my cars so I am not sure about the steps I should take.

How could I have been so blind? Some background on myself and I'll go over why I named the title what it is.

I come from a lower middle-class Hispanic family who immigrated here years ago. Both of my parents are legal and I was born on American soil. My entire life I have been ignorant to care about politics, I just ate up whatever adults threw at me and regurgitated it like a Pavlovian dog. I've been told all my life by my parents that hard work pays off in the long run, you are only worth what you make yourself to be worth, you can not expect to get things for free, etc. And I am about that more than ever as someone who has been asleep and not paying attention to anything.

**I am a gay Hispanic male, and I am here to say, thank God I got the wake-up call about what is happening to my country.**

I was in the 6th grade when Obama got himself into office and I was benign as to why it was such a bad thing for him to be in power.

*wants socialism and equal everything for everyone* **"That doesn't sound bad at all, right? Being equal to everything is good."**


*gay marriage* **"Oh, I'm gay, therefore; I should be all for everything he stands for"**


*immigration laws* **"I'm Hispanic, makes sense I support Obama cuz i'M hIsPaNiC"**


*he's black* **"Sure, why not, itz diverzity"**

Shortly after his second term, I keep seeing small details of his crazy policies and him making Islam the best thing since sliced bread. I don't condone religious violence or anything of the sort but there's a worry of more terrorist attacks and I just sat there baffled that he was defending it.

Then the rise of the SJW's happens and I see it coming and it worried me more about all this love for wanting "equality" and ending the practice of getting two sides of a story so they could justify their emotional rebuttals and all reasoning. I see people claiming genders and wanting to be treated differently just because they so, and I take a back seat and wonder why? I came out to my dad who not supportive to my coming out, however, he eventually came around and told me (in his Spanish wording) that it's best to judge a man by his character and how he treats others than what he does with other people. And it really hit me in a good way to not just immediately like someone or their ideas merely by face value, it taught me to be more cynical of who was worth my time as an individual.

Fast forward to the last election and all I hear about is the scandal about Hillary and I'm shitting bricks "I don't trust this woman at all now". Then Trump steps in and I just laugh it off, I didn't even give him a second look because all I saw was a reboot of The Apprentice and just ignored the man. And then we get to more recent times, Valentine's day this year, another mass shooting at a school. I am definitely worried now. Not because of the massacre, but because of the narrative, the media played on it when I went out of my way to find answers. And then I just see all these people who don't even know what the fuck they're protesting for!!! WHAT IS THIS!?

**1) Virtrue signaling everything and everyone to pander to the audience**

**2) "The weapon used was an automatic semi-auto Assault rifle" wot***

**3) "You can't have semi-automatic guns that are able to shoot 3000 rounds a minute, just ban everything related to it" *Doesn't understand civilian guns bought are by default semi-automatic if sold***

**4) The startling 1984-esque story unfolding from all this misunderstood thought about the uninformed and how they should be telling me what I can and can not have as was given to me by the 2nd Amendment**

If you would have told me years ago that I would have voted for Trump, I would have called you a fucking idiot for even thinking of such a thing. I didn't give a shit about politics up until then.

I wish I did vote Trump.....................and I am disappointed in myself and the people who are misinformed for not questioning at least once in their lifetime what they see on Facebook, Vox, Buzzfeed.

I'm happy I actually started to pay attention. **And I'll be happy to Make America Great Again.**

2005 Cobalt SS Going into Limp Mode [P0171 &amp; P0068] As the title implies, I’ve been having trouble with my car going into limp mode, and I’m at a loss for what to do. It’s the supercharged variant, and it’s at 227k miles. I’ll try to provide as much relevant information as possible, in hope that someone out there can provide any helpful info.

When the codes are cleared, it runs without any noticeable problems. The issue comes, however, when I’m at WOT around 4k-5k RPM. The car jolts, and the drivers info screen reads ENGINE POWER REDUCED. It then runs on two cylinders until I turn the car off and back on.

The codes that I’m getting are:
P0171: System too lean bank 1
P0068: throttle position/MAF correlation

A few months ago I had the same problem, and cleaning the throttle body seemed to remedy it for awhile. I’ve since tried again, and not had such luck.

It started happening when the weather got colder, and I have an aftermarket K&amp;N intake.

I’m hoping someone can graciously provide me with some guidance. I’d rather not replace the throttle body/MAF sensor to find that it doesn’t fix the issue. Is there a procedure/any way to determine what the specific problem is?

Thanks

EDIT: I forgot to mention, after idling for awhile it starts to rev a little on its own. The RPM floats slowly up to 1500, then quickly drops to ~500, making the car shudder, before it goes quickly back up to 1500. If I give it a quick blip, it'll settle back at its normal idle.

2007 Kx 250f Running issues I was out doing some woods riding on my KX 250f and my bike cut off while riding.  After some kicking, I was able to get the bike started and moved about half a mile before it cut off on me again and was unable to start it.  I figured it was valves as I hadn't had them done and took the bike to a shop to have the valves inspected, adjusted, and the carbs cleaned out as well.

After getting the bike back, It started super easy, and did not idle as high as it used to.  After letting the bike heat up and riding everything seemed fine and normal until slowing down for corners where it would cut off.  It was very frustrating after spending money to get the bike fixed and spend more time trying to kickstart the bike than I did riding.  The symptoms that I noticed are

* -The bike starts fine when cold and seems to ride ok until getting hot.
* -While idling, I would notice the bike would have bouts of sputtering and would cut off and die.
* -after getting hot, the bike seems ok when riding, but when slowing down for corners, even when I'm on the clutch, the bike just dies.  Almost as if it doesn't have enough energy/momentum to get into the next stroke, or possibly has too much gas and just bogs down.
* -When the bike dies from riding like above, I'll spend forever kicking the bike and may get it started, but as soon as I try to start moving as you normally would, the bike will bog down and die before moving 5ft.  Almost as if its flooded.
* -Once or twice, I noticed that at WOT in 2nd gear I got a little bit of a bogging in the engine, almost as if the ratio was off.

I don't know whats going on, as I can start the bike and everything rides fine for about 5 - 10 minutes, and then I keep getting these issues.  I'd rather see if someone else might have an idea of what might be going on as I don't want to keep throwing money at the bike to get it fixed if I don't even know whats going on.  To me all the issues seem to point to the carb.  But the carb was fine before taking the bike in, I only had the shop clean the carb as the bike had been sitting for a few months before I took it in.  I couldn't imagine the shop messing up a simple carb cleaning.  Any Ideas?

2005 Mazda 6 1.8 - Insane oil consumption Hi

I recently purchased a 2005 Mazda 6 with 150k miles from an auction for cheap.

It has the 1.8L Duratec engine and a 5 speed manual.

It looks great, has recently had major service and runs great, but after a week I noticed a severe problem.

It uses a quart of oil every 100 miles (!).

During normal operation, like slow driving or 50mph roads it doesn't smoke badly at all. Maybe a little bit?

Except if I floor it to redline, a giant blue cloud trails the car. However, if I do a full throttle acceleration the second time it doesn't smoke. If then drive normally again for some time, and then do a WOT acceleration again I get another nice blue cloud behind the car.

If I drive spirited the entire time there are no giant blue clouds. It seems fairly clean then.

The car doesn't smoke after sitting for a bit or on deceleration.

Where should I start looking on my Mazda's insane oil fetish?

Apart from the insane oil consumption and pitch black spark plugs it runs great. Good compression, runs smooth and good power.

I know that the Duratec engines from that period are plagued with oil ring issues, but when the oil rings are bad it should burn oil continuously and smoke continuously, but that's not exactly what's going on.

Also.. a quart every 100 miles.... Help?

Thanks in advance.

Paladin explodes, but he's ok now. &gt;Be DM running Wild magic Campaign


&gt;Paladin gets hit with wild magic and has a skeleton appear next to him


&gt;The skeleton mimics everything the paladin does because a piece of the paladin's soul is in the skeleton.


&gt;During fights paladins hits things with his sword
Sometimes the skeleton gets a hit in and deals some damage.


&gt;Neato


&gt;Party fighting revenants


&gt;Skeleton gets dead and explodes into dust


&gt;Paladin is sad


&gt;Being the gracious the DM I am, I have a piece of skeleton dust drift over to a sacrificial altar and land in another pile of dust.


&gt;Paladin touches dust


&gt;The skeleton dust spells out "I miss you"


&gt;Paladin "wot?"


&gt;Skeleton dust "I want to be one with you again, I need a piece of your bone to be one with you again"


&gt;Now I'm thinking the paladin is going to cut off the tip of his pinky toe or something, drop it in the dust, so skeleton bro forms a new body.


&gt;Nope


&gt;Paladin "I take my greatsword and cut my arm"


&gt;Me "Your cutting your arm off?!"


&gt;Paladin "No i'm just gunna cut myself until i hit bone."


&gt;Me "uhhhhh"


&gt;Paladin "And I'm going to shove all the bone dust in there"


&gt;Me " UUUHHHHHHHH"


&gt;Paladin shoves all the bone dust in his arm.


&gt;Paladin's arm becomes engorged, the rest of his body swells up shortly after and he explodes.


&gt;Paladin chunks go flying everywhere.


&gt;Left standing where the paladin was is a bloody skeleton.


&gt;Me "So you died, and now your body inhabits that skeleton"


&gt;Paladin "Oh."


&gt;Druid "I can't heal skeletons"


&gt;Ohfuck.jpeg


&gt;Paladin "Well you know reincarnate, so you could just give me a new body, we have my exploded body parts"


&gt;Druid "Well reincarnate says the target has to be dead for no more than 10 days. So we got time."


&gt;Skeleton Paladin now is running around for the next 10 days doing borderline suicidal feats because he has an extra life.

Squeak noise during transmission upshifts I have a built transmission that shifts lightning fast in my Mustang and during upshifts at or near WOT, a squeak noise [(audible in this video)](https://youtu.be/PIowRUorEw4) is heard coming from the front of the car.  It's noticeably audible from inside (and of course outside) the car.  My friends and I theorize that it might be the accessory belt slipping during the shift, but as far as I know, there is no easy way to check that.  Do you guys have any other ideas as to what it might be?

Me [25 /F] with my new roommate [23 /F] she moved in 3 days ago and my place is already trashed. Help! So, I've been living alone for the past 7 months but I always ha roommates before that. I decided I'd get one again in my new apartment to help reduce the cost of rent. It's a really nice apartment and I've kept it very clean and well maintained. The new roommate (we'll call her Sally) had told me that she was very clean and that her was well behaved and trained. She seemed really normal and sweet so I went for it. She moved in a little less than 3 days ago and my apartment is trashed! It smells like piss and BO and the stench gets stronger the closer you get to where her room is. I mentioned it to her and suggested she at least open a window but she hasn't done even that. She started using my things without asking within an hour of moving in. Her dog has peed in the apartment twice that I know of and I had to clean it up even though she had been home all day and was right there. There's pet hair everywhere. And I mean everywhere. I grew up with 3 dogs in the house and that still never amounted to this. I can't leave my room without shoes on because my feet turn black with grime instantly. I work from home and used to sit in the living room but I can't do that because her dog will constantly jump on me. Plus the dog hair and general gross-ness makes my nose get stuffy, swell, and hurt and makes my eyes burn and water so much I can't even read my laptop. I've mentioned the pet hair several times but she hasn't made an effort to clean anything once. It's only day 3 and it's this messy already. What can I do without causing more harm than good?

 TL;DR New roommate of three days and her dog have trashed my apartment, she uses my things, and wot clean up.

Canyons crash replacement service Right this is a bit of a rant. So I crash and break my seatstay on my strive yesterday, bit gutted but oh well shit happens what can you do. Was well prepared to pay for a new one, absolutely fine no issues with that since obviously doesn't fall under warranty. So I contact canyon and explain what happened and that all I need is a seatstay. They got back to me today and told me "you fall under the second year of crash replacement (costs a bit more) and we would charge you £1700 for a new frameset". Wot...So instead of sending the single part, no bearings, no components, the simplest part of the frame, they can only sell me an entire new frame. WTF
So as a word of warning, if you really really want a canyon, that's the bike you are set on, just bear in mind their piss poor customer service.
So in the end I've sent my seatstay to a carbon bike repair company to get it repaired. Much cheaper but not as cheap as it would be if I had a giant or specialized when you can just buy seatstays outright.
Fuck canyon

Drz won't idle I recently got a big bore kit installed in my motor. Was running a yoshi rs2 when i picked the bike up last week from the mechanic, but had an mrd zpro on the way. The bike ran great with the yosh and tuned well and i did a nice break in and changed the oil at 30 miles. Pipe came in monday so i put it on and everything seemed to be running fine after starting it up post pipe installation. Fired it up yesterday to ride after work and it idled fine on warm up. Took off and went about 3 miles to the gas station to fill up and when i pulled the clutch in she died at the pump. Couldn't get it to idle after that. I got it home just by going WOT on start up and keeping the revs up.

Today i checked the gas tank (manual petcock) which is working fine, pulled the cap off to see if that would make a difference and it didnt. Pulled the carb and put new jets in as i thought that might be the issue. No dice. Currently running fcr39mx at sea level

155 main
45 pilot
EMN Needle on third clip
A/F 2 turns out

The bike will start if i give it gas but cuts out as soon as i let off. I checked the oil for gas smell and it is fine. I'm running out of ideas here and would really prefer not to bring it back to the shop.

Any ideas?

mk4 wagon-- new clutch, drivetrain shuddering at 1700-2200 rpm at WOT **sorry in advance for the long post.. x-post from tdiclub**
Hey all i have an 04 jetta wagon (bew) with stage 1.5 malone tune.

Just had the clutch replaced with a LUK 1.8t clutch kit as well as a new DMF and other associated bits. Before getting this done I had done a 5000km road trip and there was ZERO vibration in any gear at any rpm.

Upon getting my car back and giving it about a 500km break in, I noticed some serious shuddering/vibration between 1700-2100rpm. Noticeable in 3rd, worse in 4th, nearing violent in 5th but only at full throttle and it only comes in when the boost first hits maximum pressure. The vibration smoothes out above about 2100-2200 rpm.

I took it back to the shop and he said that he had never experienced these symptoms in all the years hes worked on these cars. When I first described the symptoms he thought it was the Inner CV Joint but upon driving it he said it feels different than that.

Has anybody else ever heard of or experienced these symptoms? After doing the T-belt, suspension, and now clutch kit I dont have money to start replacing random parts hoping that itll fix it.

Given that the symptoms popped up as soon as the clutch work was done I am suspecting the culprit is something that was done with the clutch work. I have heard of similar symptoms being blamed on an out of balance DMF, but if that was the case it would stand to reason it would be shaking at those rpms regardless of how much throttle was on it.

The only other thing that was done while it was there was a new transmission mount/dogbone.

The mechanic told me to drive another 1000km or so and see if it wears in. well 1000km later it hasnt gotten any better and im hoping to have some info to bring to him instead of just starting to replace parts randomly hoping that something fixes it.

[Excerpt][Baneblade] In which an Ork weirdboy draws on the Great Green, and we get a little factoid about the true nature of the Ork. The Humble Bundle wot is of Warhammer has *Baneblade* in the first tier for a dollar: it's right up there with *Gunheads* for awesome Imperial Armour action.

&gt;Greeneye’s Gargant opened up with its cannons and rockets, blasting holes in the ground all around the human wagon, hammering into its hull, shells dragging sparks from its hide, pulling chunks of it away. The little turret with its funny heavy shootas on the front crashed away, the armour on one side buckled, but it still came on.

&gt;He ceased to think as an unquenchable fury took him, the unreasoning violence that existed in every ork, a need to smash and burn and win and conquer, to kill and kill until there was no one left, no one left at all but orks, and then they’d fight some more.

&gt;His powerful mind swelled with it, drawing energy directly from the immaterial realm of the Great Green where Gork and Mork laughed and clapped at his anger. Lightning arced about him, fizzing from his head, skittering up to the great copper spheres high above the Gargant’s back, amplifying his power. He felt the mind of every ork on the planet, each alight with war and violence. He drew upon them, every one, and those beyond Kalidar, and beyond this system, the great green sea of eldritch energy that surrounded the orkish race, protected it, generated by their exuberance and lust for conquest. Time slowed and Greeneye ceased to see the material world, looking instead through his mind’s-eye, seeing the world reflected in the green of the weird.

&gt;Through a crackling haze of sparks, Greeneye looked down; the power was building in him, surging to be set loose. He could not hold it for much longer. Unable to speak, he slammed his palm down. It fell slowly, although Greeneye knew it was moving fast, until it connected with a big button, activating the wailing siren that informed the captain of the Gargant’s warp cannon that it was time to deploy.

&gt;Greeneye laughed and laughed as he felt the deck vibrate beneath his feet. Below him, the Gargant’s tongue would be jutting out, ready to unleash the fury of Gork and Mork on the stupid humans below him, fury that flowed through him.

&gt;The big cannon on the tank turret ground upwards. Greeneye laughed, at it. So pathetic! It belched fire, and Greeneye stopped laughing.

&gt;Something was wrong. There was an absence in the scene before him, in the world painted in shades of violent green, a black streak, a shell from the gun, a shell his weird-eyes could not see.

&gt;When it reached the Gargant’s warp-born energy field, the shell did not stop. Greeneye felt the strange shell pierce his psychic defences, green energy rippling as it broke through.

&gt;Greeneye did not know it, but his anger was born from fear, the fear of a race which died millions of years ago, a fear that drove them to grasp at any means of survival, in no matter how debased a form. That fear flared in him now as the shell continued on into the Gargant’s armour, smashed through it and exploded inside.

2015 Dodge Charger V8 - Engine or Drivetrain noise Just picked up a used 2015 Charger Pursuit V8. 50k on the clock.

The alignment is atrocious and the previous owner didn't put wheel weights on. Lame. Getting that fixed tomorrow.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xj6q4lhNtUI0rJ373

The above link shows the wonderful noise I hear at idle, which gets worse as i drive closer to WOT. It sounds like a muffled flutter from the engine, and when I open the window (this may be unrelated) I can hear rotational drag (could be alignment there). The car seems to run fine and I took it on a 400 mile 3 state trip today, for what it's worth.

It should still be covered under powertrain, but any ideas what this might be?

Noise I can only hear while driving... fun. Help please :( Need some help figuring this out.
TLDR: I'm having a whistle sound on acceleration and a lean issue at WOT.
2012 Ford Focus SE 5sp manual NA

Current Mods -
K&amp;N drop in filter
63mm TB from the ecoboost mustang
Obx Header
Fswerks Exhaust

So since I installed the header I've been having a whistle/hiss sound as well as a lean issue at WOT. Not sure if the two issues are connected but it's driving me crazy trying to find the culprit.

The whistle/hiss Happens at a stand still but only when I rev. Can't tell where it's coming from, I think front end or underneath me. Happens around 2500-3000rpm up to about 4000rpm any gear which makes it really hard test location of the sound. Happens even if I'm accelerating slowly. Weirdly if I'm light on the pedal until I hear it and then I back off just a smidge the sound will stop and I can continue to accelerate without the sound as long as I don't press the pedal further down.

No CEL but my tuner says I'm running lean at WOT. I originally thought it was my Fswerks CAI but I switched back to my OEM airbox with drop in K&amp;N and it's still the same noise, not even a reduction in volume. So then I thought maybe it's one of the gaskets for the header so I adjusted them, no result, replaced them, no result. Thought maybe it's a vacuum leak so I checked all the connections I could see and even all the electrical connectors, no results. Just for good measure I replaced my spark plugs, cleaned my MAF, and added a bottle of fuel system cleaner (Techron). Smoke tested the intake, no leaks found. Took it to an exhaust shop, they found two leaks in my exhaust with the stethoscope, had those both fixed, one joint welded, one properly clamped.... no result. They said they found no leaks at the header gaskets or flex-pipe. Checked my TB today make sure the seal isn't protruding inward and making it whistle, looks fine. Not sure what else to look at....

Boyfriend [19] "joked" about me harassing him about him having an affair idk how to feel He wanted to go to the shops for a drink and buy cigarettes and I (18f) was just concerned bc he wanted to quit and did for months until he started hanging out with his friend again (we'll call him agony) and he's leaving this week to see his mormon family so it's just why buy a pouch if you can't smoke around them.
Anyway I was just asking him if he's okay etc bc he came home from hanging with agony all say and fell asleep asap and I'm worried for his mental wellbeing since the other day when stuff happened (took a new drug I was tripsitting).

Well he said he was fine and then said "I'll have my phone so if you want to text me and harrass me incase I'm having an affair then go for it" and I was just like wot. I had a real angry look on my face bc what?? He's never said something like that before

I don't text him consistently and the last time I did was last year around November when he was hanging with his friend but it was never about a girl I was angry bc my pop stayed up and waited to pick him up after work to drop him home [my pop is 82 and it was about 10 at night] so not bc he was gonna cheat on me. I've never accused him of something like that.

Maybe the one time I told him I had a fear he was gonna meet someone new but that was just a passive conversation and we were talking not arguing and it was face to face.

I just don't understand why he would say that?  Could his friend have said something to make him think this way? I don't know and I don't think he's going to talk about it. We've been together 8 months.

The wind saying my name. This happened like 7 years ago.
I happened to encounter this website so I though it was a great opportunitty to share this with you. So here we go.

Sometimes I wake up at 3 am almost every night for no reason, I'm used to that because that happens to me since I'm a kid, but this night in particular was a very windy night, it was raining and the wind was shaking the windows.

I closed my eyes trying to sleep again when suddenly "...Anooooon", didn't hear that very well, my eyes still closed but I was like "..wot"... and then again, louder, "Aaaaanooooon". I opened my eyes in complete disbelieve of what I just heard, the fucking wind was really saying my name, I was in complete silence and still hearing “aaanoooon”.

I slapped my face 4 or 5 times saying to myself “This is just a dream”.

My face was hurting, and no, after that, I was so sure that was NOT a dream, I was hearing it, loud an clear, as like someone is just standing outside, just a few feet away.

I try to ignore that, and just close my eyes waiting the voice to fade away.

Hah! Silly me.

And suddenly, two taps at the window, couldn’t see the person because I have thick curtains, but the main problem is, that I live in an apartment building, 8th floor, unless the mofo was climbing the window fences, so I got up losing my shit and turned on the lights, I was about to open my fucking curtains to see, but something in my mind told me to absolutely NOT do it.

But at the moment I turned off the lights and lie in bed again, once again "Aaaaanooon"

Well, fuck that shit, and I did what a normal person does.... Force Field Blanket Mode ON.

Somehow I managed to sleep again.

Morning.

I was asking to myself if it was a dream or not, because that shit was so unreal.

Had to go to religion class... Ugh.

I'm not a religious person but I can say that some things can't be explain.... at least not for now.

Teacher explain how Jesus protects people, and tell us to open our books.

I was still thinking about what happened that night, and then, I fucking see it in that page on the book.

Basically said "One of the ways that jesus protects his most loved ones is repeating their names over and over by using, animals, water, or WIND"

Lost my shit after reading that. Like, are you fucking serious?!

Don't worry, I'm not the type of person that says "God loves you" and all that shit, you can believe what you want, I have some atheist friends and I don't give a shit. Like I said, I'm not a very religious person.

But I must say... If he wanted to protect me, at least he could've found another way instead of making shit my pants.

Got APR Plus today... Any questions?

Its definitely faster, the car pulls pretty god damn hard in second gear, when I was driving it if I gave it a hard pull in 2nd it would spin tires at about 45mph. Doesn't feel as "surge-y" as people say the stage 1 feels,  and I got the same MPG on my 35 mile commute back from the tuner as I did when I got to the tuner (33mpg).

Not many backroads to test it on, but in 4th gear WOT it was showing 33lbs of boost.. obviously subtract 14.7 or something for outside, and this is going pretty damn fast but it was a empty highway.

White hats and Black hats...let me talk about that, and the significance.. Let me talk about something ive briefly touched on in the past, the significance of the terms white hats and black hats.

Ill be copy/pasting, so I apologize if the formatting sucks, or if there is WOT issues. Ill add links to sites if you prefer the sources and want to read there, as well as a short TL;DR at the bottom.

***WHITE HAT:***

A white hat aka a halo, also called a nimbus, is a geometric shape, usually in the form of a disk, circle, ring, or rayed structure. Traditionally, the halo represents a radiant light around or above the head of a divine or sacred person. Since halos are found nowhere in the Bible, what is their origin in Christianity?

Interestingly, the word “halo” comes from the Greek word for a threshing floor. It was on these floors that oxen moved round and round in a continuous circle on the ground, making a circular path in the shape we now associate with halos. Many ancient societies, including the Egyptians, Indians and Romans, used a circular sign to suggest supernatural forces, such as angels, at work.

In art, halos originally appeared as disks of gold sketched upon the head of a figure. This depicted a sphere of light radiating from the head of the person, suggesting that the subject was in a mystical state or sometimes just very smart. Because of its shape and color, the halo was also associated with the sun and resurrection. By the fourth century, the halo had become widely used in standard Christian art. Essentially, it was used to mark a figure as being in the kingdom of light. Most commonly, Jesus and the Virgin Mary are shown with halos, along with the angels. In fact, halos are found in art forms all over the world. Sometimes, especially in the East, crowns are used instead of halos, but the meaning is the same: holiness, innocence and spiritual power.

With it not being found in the Bible, the halo is both pagan and non-Christian in its origin. Many centuries before Christ, natives decorated their heads with a crown of feathers to represent their relationship with the sun god. The halo of feathers upon their heads symbolized the circle of light that distinguished the shining divinity or god in the sky. As a result, these people came to believe that adopting such a nimbus or halo transformed them into a kind of divine being.

However, interestingly enough, before the time of Christ, this symbol had already been used by not only the Hellenistic Greeks in 300 B.C., but also by the Buddhists as early as the first century A.D. In Hellenistic and Roman art, the sun-god, Helios, and Roman emperors often appear with a crown of rays. Because of its pagan origin, the form was avoided in early Christian art, but a simple circular nimbus was adopted by Christian emperors for their official portraits.

From the middle of the fourth century, Christ was portrayed with this imperial attribute, and depictions of His symbol, the Lamb of God, also displayed halos. In the fifth century, halos were sometimes given to angels, but it was not until the sixth century that the halo became customary for the Virgin Mary and other saints. For a period during the fifth century, living persons of eminence were depicted with a square nimbus.

Then, throughout the Middle Ages, the halo was used regularly in representations of Christ, the angels, and the saints. Often, Christ’s halo is quartered by the lines of a cross or inscribed with three bands, interpreted to signify His position in the Trinity. Round halos are typically used to signify saints, meaning those people considered as spiritually gifted. A cross within a halo is most often used to represent Jesus. Triangular halos are used for representations of the Trinity. Square halos are used to depict unusually saintly living personages.

As we’ve stated at the outset, the halo was in use long before the Christian era. It was an invention of the Hellenists in 300 B.C. and is not found anywhere in the Scriptures. In fact, the Bible gives us no example for the bestowal of a halo upon anyone. If anything, the halo has been derived from the profane art forms of ancient secular art traditions.

***BLACK HAT:***

Thanks in part to The Wizard of Oz, the word witch has become code for a certain type of dress. Flowing black robes. Black boots. Accessorize as you wish with a broom or a grassy complexion, but on pain of expulsion from the coven, do not forget the peaked, black, wide-brimmed hat.

The hat makes the witch, to paraphrase Mark Twain. And yet the story of this particular hat—where it originated, and how it took on its demonic resonance—is a murky one. That’s largely because history is full of pointy hats, from the tapering hennins favored by medieval noblewomen to the soft Phrygian caps adopted by French revolutionaries (and Smurfs). There are simply too many varieties of pointy hat to describe in a single blog post, more possible antecedents than can be ruled out. But weirdly, one of the earliest incarnations of the conical headpiece is also one of the most familiar: Three female mummies uncovered in the Chinese region of Subeshi [PDF]—known as the “witches of Subeshi”—are famous for covering their hair with large funnel-shaped contraptions of black felt. They look like aunts in a fourth century B.C. outtake from Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

Experts aren’t sure exactly when pointed lids became associated with sorcery. Medieval depictions of witches often show them nude and bare-headed, their long hair mingling with flames and smoke. Woodcuts from the 1600s occasionally outfitted spell-casters in common bonnets. It wasn’t until the 1710s and 1720s that children’s chapbooks in England began illustrating supernatural tales with crones in peaked hats. Fueled by the popularity of these “penny merriments,” the stereotype caught on quickly. Western European artists began to modify images of witches from the Middle Ages, lengthening the blunt tips of their caps into devilish spikes. According to Gary Jensen, a former professor at Vanderbilt and author of The Path of the Devil: Early Modern Witch Hunts, the pointed cap became an easy, evocative way to signal dark magic. Witches in peaked hats started to appear on postcards from the American colonies. Legendary figures like Mother Goose and La Belfana—an Italian mother deranged by the death of her infant, said to fly through the night air delivering gifts to children—acquired pointy hats. During the Salem Witch Trials, witnesses reported seeing the devil: “a large black man with a high, crowned hat.” Later, Victorian-era storybooks further developed the theme.

But this timeline doesn’t tell us why conical hats were first chosen to represent evil. Less substantiated theories invoke old stories of witches in medieval England being forced to don crowns shaped like church steeples. The caps were supposedly meant to draw down God’s grace in a last-ditch effort to redeem the wearers. Or perhaps the credit goes to folk artists, who as early as the 1500s used pointed hats to subtly evoke devil horns, though rarely on women. (Goya’s 1798 oil painting, “Witches in the Air,” is an eerie outgrowth of this trend.)

The two explanations that seem most plausible have to do with real-life marginalized groups. In his book, Jensen describes how the 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran required all Jews to identify themselves by wearing the Judenhat (“Jewish hat” or “horned skullcap”). The style soon became a target for Anti-Semitism. Artists painted devils muttering curses beneath Jewish crowns. In 1431, Hungarian legal codes required first-time sorcery offenders to walk among their peers in “peaked Jews’ caps.” Medieval representations tying Jews to Satan were nothing new, and by the late 13th century, Jewish attributes had soaked up enough ugly significance to tar all “unbelievers, hypocrites, heretics, pagans, and demons,” Jensen writes. So does the Wicked Witch of the West’s iconic chapeau reflect an ancient association between black magic and the Chosen People?

A second theory holds that the pairing of witches and peaked hats flows from anti-Quaker prejudice. A minority sect in colonial America, the Quakers were thought to consort with devils and dabble in witchcraft. Puritan backlash against the community was cresting in the mid-18th century, at around the same time that the figure of the cone-headed spell-weaver began to insinuate herself into American folklore. There’s just one problem with this hypothesis: Quakers didn’t wear pointed hats. But the theory may yet hold water. Quaker headgear was itself the locus of squall and controversy. The movement’s founder, George Fox, famously refused to doff his hat in the presence of Cromwell’s ministers. "When the Lord sent me forth into the world He forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low,” Fox told the magistrates. (Why? Because such “hat-honour” was “invented by men in the fall and in the alienation from God.”) Fox endured three separate prison stays for his disrespect; in the colonies, Friends honored his example by keeping their hair covered at all times. In 1876, an American magazine called Littell’s Living Age hailed the Quaker hat as “the war-standard of this quaint army of non-fighters.” Colonial Puritans, though, were not so kind, at times using the hats as an excuse to prosecute their religious rivals. Jensen suspects that it was a short hop from the Quaker cap as a symbol of doctrinal insubordination to the witch’s hat as an emblem of infernal craft.

Of course, most modern people who identify as witches don’t actually wear the stereotypical witch’s hat. (They don’t have to pull on flowing garments either, although certain rituals are associated with color-coded robes.) Still, the peaked cap holds special significance for some Wiccans, who see it as a visual representation of the Cone of Power they draw on for their spells.

TL;DR + my comments

A white hat is a halo, originated from a threshing floor, the bible uses that description as a visual for judgement. Holy or very intelligent beings are shown to have a halo, which in a nutshell is light radiating from their head. Jesus, Moses, Angels and more were said to radiate with light after a 'transfiguration' process. Angels simply means messengers. Q are messengers, and highly intelligent MI at that, hence HALOs aka white hats. There is likely a supernatural component involved too, hence the asking for prayer, reciting of Bible verses - and "Youll be surprised when you find out who is posting here"...

Black hats on the contrary represent witches. Demonic influence. General evil.

"I can imagine Trump singing this to his douchey daughter." - my dad in response to my father/daughter dance song choice. I'm sorry, you wot, m8?

For the record, the song is You'll Be In My Heart from the 1999 hit classic, Tarzan. A song that my dad used to sing to me when I was a kid... but that now apparently reminds him of Trump.


**Dad:** I like this song, but isn't it a little creepy? I can imagine Trump singing this to his douchey daughter.

**Me:** Cool cool.. any suggestions for a different song, then?

**Dad:** No, let's do this one, I do like that song. Hopefully I don't get too misty.

**Me:** Don't worry, I'll tell jokes to keep things light. Like, remember that time you said our song reminded you of Trump?

"I throw a rock at God!" This story harkens back to when I was in high school, just getting introduced to D&amp;D through some friends (*see: inexperienced, uncoordinated, unconfident teenagers*).

The DM was the only one with a job at the time, so he was generous enough to buy some player books for us...  As well as organize times, write up his own custom campaign, provide snacks.  Basically, the nicest guy I know making D&amp;D the most approachable social gathering our friend group would have.

At the time none of our houses could really host the 6+ players who'd typically show up, so the DM would book out the upstairs room in the local gaming store for us once a month or so.  Again, stellar guy, especially considering our sessions would often take a walk down murderhobo-lane because we were edgy teenagers.

---

So, we're early into a session #1 of a new campaign and everyone's excited to start new characters and get into the DM's worldbuilding.
We've already spent the first hour making sure we got our character sheets right, so we're antsy to get into some gameplay.

Suddenly, we hear the creaking of stairs behind us.  "Funny," we thought, "we aren't expecting anyone else."  Maybe the owner needs something from upstairs.  Little did we know; the straining of stairs foretold the approach of the group's first ***That Guy***.

&amp;nbsp;

See the gaming store held their own Adventurer's League type events, and this That Guy was notorious for derailing stories, exploiting rules, giving newbies bad advice, and just being right shitter.  *We’d all find this out after-the-fact*.  The only reason he wasn't banned from the store earlier (I'll get to that later), was because his parents were related to the owner, and they wanted That Guy to make friends with the poor patrons, even though he was in his mid-twenties.
**Spoilers**: He ain't trying to make friends.

&amp;nbsp;

The smell of ruined sessions past breaches the doorway before we even get a line of sight on the guy.  Thankfully, our swiss-army-DM had a can of Febreze handy.
That Guy sits down and immediately slaps down a character sheet, pre-filled out.

"Would you like to join in?" The DM asks innocently.  He's the kind of person that tries to include everyone.

Some highlights of the coffee-stained sheet were: *maxed rolls, self-insert personality (not inherently bad), ridiculously overpowered homebrew weapon, bag of holding (supposedly from his starting equipment), and of course a customised fighter homebrew*.  The DM only agreed to him using his pre-made character for time's sake because we'd already burned through a quarter of our booked timed, and he was probably as excited to get into the session as we were.

"Yeah.  What campaign we playing?"  The first hurdle was trying to explain that it's a custom campaign the DM had prepared.  That Guy argued that we shouldn't be playing with an 'official' ruleset as they were reserved for premade-campaigns, saying that custom campaigns required a homebrew ruleset.  Progression was already a stand-still.

We only managed to get things going again when we collectively decided to ignore his protests and pressed on.  Now since we were still young, I think a lot of us were in the mindset of "He's older than us with more experience, therefor he probably knows how things should work."  If you're reading this and you're new to D&amp;D, call people out on their bullshit.  If something doesn't sound right check the book.  Being new to D&amp;D shouldn't be an excuse for people to take advantage of your lack of knowledge.

&amp;nbsp;

That being said, we were young, naive, and without foresight.  That Guy immediately starts acting up in-game.
Every *roll*, *encounter*, *or roleplaying moment*, That Guy tries to steal the spotlight.

Our rouge tries to sneak around some enemies.  "**I SNEAK WITH HIM.**"  "But you have disadvantage with heavy armour." "Actually, I don't because &lt;fake reason&gt;."

The Paladin (yours truly) attempts to converse with some guards.  "**I ATTACK THE GUARDS!**" "But they were friendly..." "Yeah but the DM was about to have them try and arrest us anyway so..."

The party's druid, a timid girl who's also the DM's partner, wants to commune with nature to maybe get a hint at the current situation.  "**I BURN THE TREE TO INDIMIDATE IT.**" The DM sighs.  The party sighs.  The druid goes quiet and slinks down in her chair.

During That Guy's interjections the DM would always stare daggers at him, which was surprising given the calming aura the DM often exuded.  When you've made the one guy who could tolerate you angry, you should know that you have fucked up and to shut up.  That Guy did not.

&amp;nbsp;

It was around then that the DM had opted to just retcon most of That Guy's actions, a collective sigh of relief was heard.  No forest fires, no random acts of violence, no stealing of the party's pooled gold.  This set That Guy off.  He immediately started ranting about how the DM's breaking immersion and ruining his player agency.  Essentially saying he shouldn't be a DM if he won't let players walk all over him.

DM's response:  "*I'm God.  Deal with it.*"  ~~Foreshadowing~~ Thankfully, this shut him up for a while.

&amp;nbsp;

We spent the rest of the session playing like normal.  Goofing around creatively rather than destructively.  That Guy was brooding off in the corner on his phone.  In-game we'd just abandoned his fighter and moved on.  Eventually the session was leading to a climax.  We'd all been pretty beat up, low-health, low-spells, but the *Small-Bad-Evil-Guy* we'd been chasing for the whole session was cornered.

Of course, this set off alarm bells for That Guy, thinking he was missing out on some *awe-inspiring* moment that would redeem all his previous behaviour.  He jumped back into his seat, previously being away-from-character for at least 2 hours, and immediately perked up to what was happening.  "*We left you behind in the last town.*" The peanut gallery exclaims.

That Guy's muppet mouth was about to unhinge to let loose a whirlwind of "Um, actually" before the DM swiftly interrupted.
"You're here, okay?  You followed the party and now you're behind them." The gracious DM answered while plopping his magnet behind the party's on the combat grid.

&amp;nbsp;

Initiative was rolled.  Damage was dealt.  Characters were downed.  The DM had learnt from previous sessions that we loved a comeback victory against strong odds, so he often played combat pretty close to the wire.

A couple rounds in the Evil-Guy was bloodied but our cleric and barbarian were downed.  We needed to finish off the Evil-Guy within the next round to hope to revive our fallen party members.

It was at this moment that cogs began turning in That Guy's tiny mind.  You could almost see the calculations fly past his periphery as he tried to piece together his next big move.
Our plan was simple, the druid would buff the rogue, the rogue would slice the Evil-Guy upside the neck, hopefully, if that falls through, the rest can clean up.

That Guy, apparently checked the fuck out, and wouldn’t abide by such a simple plan.  Oh no.

Instead he turns to the rogue and attacks.  "Nat20 and... **max damage**, nice!"
Now the party and DM already had talks of PvP in previous games and agreed not to do it.  Personally, I'm not against it, just feel like there's a time and a place.

That Guy looks at the DM smugly, as if he'd somehow just solved the DM’s great puzzle.  The room just stares at That Guy in disbelief.  The rogue looked like they were about to slice someone else upside the neck.

&amp;nbsp;

"**Suddenly**, before your strike lands true, a blinding beam of light pierces the heavens and burns your character for..." *rolls a single dice* "1000 radiant damage, reducing your body to a pile of ash.  *You die*."  And so did the rest of the table, from laughing.

Of course, this gets That Guy going again about how “You can't *insta-kill* characters!” and why this game was rigged against him.  A particularly juicy quote was "*You're ruining the game for the whole table!*", cue everyone saying they were fine with it and want to move on.

I guess he thought that killing our party would win the Evil-Guy's favour, so that his character may join in on the evil doings.  This was, evidently, not the case.

&amp;nbsp;

Once he simmered down, the rogue started rolling for their attack, but of course That Guy wasn't finished.

"Actually, I'm still alive."  ***u wot m8***

"No see when your character takes over their max HP below zero you die."  You could tell the DM was well and truly over That Guy's shit.

"Okay, then I use the revive potion I had on me." ~~This ain't a video game, son.~~

"You're a pile of ash."

"Yeah but it would've activated *automatically*."

"It was burnt to a crisp along with your body."

The back and forth went on for a few minutes while the rogue had already rolled their attack and damage, trying desperately to describe how they kill the Evil-Guy.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, the DM realises he's arguing with a brick wall and begins to describe Evil-Guy's death, and how an ominous voice rings throughout all the character's heads (set up for future sessions).

Well That Guy doesn't feel like being ignored, especially since it sounds like the story will progress without him.

So now we get to the gameshow section of the story, feel free to play along at home.  Guess what That Guy will do next!  Will he:

**A)** *Sit quietly given his character death and listen respectfully to the DM's worldbuilding.*

**B)** *Escape to the corner of the room to brood about the younger generation not knowing the rules of D&amp;D.*

or **C)** *Slam the brakes on the story and grab the wheel to drive us into a proverbial ravine of regret and despair.*

^You ^can ^probably ^see ^where ^this ^is ^going.

&amp;nbsp;

Mid-DM-speech That Guy pipes up "I throw a rock at God!"

The table lets out a collective "*h’wat?*"

"You said you were God, and God's everywhere. So, I throw a rock in the air, and it hits God."

At the time I think we were all too stunned to even laugh.  The DM continued his speech.

"I THROW A ROCK AT GOD! DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?" That Guy's now stood up, pointing and yelling at the DM.

The players all kind of slinking down in their chairs, now hoping we haven't accidentally been host to some escaped mental case.

You could tell the DM was about to counter with a "How does a pile of ash throw a rock?" comment or something, but before he could That Guy already commenced his ***horrendously formulated plan***.

&amp;nbsp;

He picked up a half-eaten box of crackers and hurled them *baseball-style*, with all the force his matchstick arms could muster, towards the DM screen.

It was as beautiful as it was horrifying the way the compacted flavouring at the bottom of the box was sent flying around the room.  The notes whiteboard, player sheets, DM notes were all now lightly seasoned with Sour Cream &amp; Chives shrapnel.

The room fell silent.  Everyone was inspecting the damage.

Everyone but the DM... and That Guy.

If *murderous intent* had a look, the DM was directing a ripe serving of it towards That Guy.  Who was currently debating in his head whether 1000 radiant damage in real life was preferable to his current situation.

That Guy turned tail ***fast*** and left without a word, even leaving behind his precious pre-made character sheet (*Later handed to our friend who loves witchcraft to curse*).  We cleaned the table and packed up without the usual session post-mortem, deciding never to play D&amp;D at the gaming store again.

---

***Party Epilogue***:  We continued to play D&amp;D for quite some time when we could, having plenty of joyous times before life got in the way and we had to put it on the backburner.
I'm currently with a new group where I've DMed/Playered and am still having a **blast**.

&amp;nbsp;

***That Guy Epilogue***:  Some time after the *incident* we found out That Guy was actually banned from the gaming store.  Something about taking the stores 'free' loaner Magic the Gathering cards and trying to sell them to younger kids.  Not sure if he ever got back in because I haven't been back since.  I like to believe he moved on to more appropriate games that would dowse his toxic player behaviour in salt.

How do you guys deal with (extreme) stress? WoT incoming!

6th Semester EE here.
Overall I'm doing pretty decent, but had my first emotional breakdown after last semester.

12h/week work (programming), 6 courses, about 5h sleep every night, not one free day for 4 month, household, girlfriend and dog demanding it's tribute.

Maybe someone is rolling his eyes about this kinda workload, but that was what I could take for a long time without anyone noticing how bad I am (not even me in the beginning)

In the end it bursted out of me and I cried for a couple hours, while my gf was trying to comfort me. (It was her birthday, but I had my control systems exam the next day and it killed me inside not having enough time for her)

After my exam on the next day I was alot better. We went out, catching up her birthday and I was able to focus on my next exams.

Hell, it feels good to get it of my chest again, not only towards my gf.


How are you dealing with similar situations?


I was thinking about getting some stuff, so I could focus better/longer (Adderall?)
Anybody got some experience with this?

Downgrading from Bont Semi-Race to softer boot (or new skates) Last season (after several years on "fitness" skates) I upgraded to a pair of Bont Semi-Race with a 4x110 setup. While I loved the speed and control, my feet couldn't take the abuse. After a few months the fat pads in my heels started disintegrating and I had to stop completely to save what's left of them and let my poor feet recover.

The problem is that the boots are simply too stiff and the padding not nearly enough. The asphalt around where I live isn't the smoothest. I tried some insoles but it wasn't enough. Also the fit is so tight that I can't get anything thicker in there.

So this season I'm looking to replace them with something softer with more dampening. Ideally I would like to get new boots only so I can keep the frame, wheels and bearings to keep cost down. Is there anything "in between" a fitness boot and the Semi-Race that would fit a 195mm mount frame? I've only found speed boots.

If that's not possible I'm looking for a pair of all new skates. The only "in-between" I've found so far seems to be all Powerslide, which are way too narrow for my feet according to their size charts. I have to prioritize comfort and dampening first so my feet can take it. I'm looking for something more all-round and more maneuverable than the Semi-Race too. I want to be able to ride around the city as well as doing some longer distance "fitness" on rough asphalt. I also have wide duck feet (272mm by 112mm) which is making finding suitable boots hard.

Would "freestyle" skates fit my needs? I don't like the idea of going back to high cuffs but if that's what it takes to get comfort and ability to skate again I'll take it. Would Seba FR1s be a good choice? They seem to be praised around here and also have a wide fit. I've been eyeing the 325 model with 3x125mm wheels.

Sorry for the WoT. I'm eager to get back into skating this season and don't want to make a mistake again so I'm looking for input, any is appreciated.

[Intro] A Nob without a WAAAGH [Gritgutz Bakkbrhka](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarHammer40kRP/comments/7jqpu3/comment/dxc39co) smashed the opposing Nob'z (attempting to prevent him from stealing the Rok) face into the wall, then powerbombed him. "OI! IZ DAT DA LAZT O' DEM?", he called out as he proceeded to eviscerate the fallen Nob with his Power Klaw. "AYE, BOSS, DAT'Z ALL AH DEM", responded one of his subordinates. "ROIGHT, DEN. MAKE SUR DAT NON O' OUR 'NEW' GITZ TRID TA SNEAK AWAY, AN' DEN TAK OFF B'FOR ONE O' DA ODDA GITZ NO-TA-CIZ WAT WE UP TA".

Minutes later, the Rok exited the planets outermost atmosphere. Gritgutz sat in the bridge, snacking on the forearm of the Nob he krumped earlier, contemplating where to go next. *"I'Z NEED A PROPA WARBAND"*, he thought to himself, *"AH WELL ESS-TAB-LSID ONE WOT ME AN' DA BOYZ CAN GIT INTA AH ROIGHT PROPA SKRAP WIT. PER-FUR-ABLY ONE WOT BE DISS-A-PLIND LOIK ME. ZOG, LOIK DAT'LL 'APPIN."*
  "OI, WHER WE GOIN', BOSS?", jolted from his stupor by this question, Gritgutz backhanded the offending Ork with his cybork arm "OI, WOT'D I'Z TEL YAZ 'BOUT IN-TRU-UPTIN' ME?!", he bellowed. Just then, he remembered hearing about a Death Skullz warband situated in Angcourt called "Da Morskin Gulgob Skragaz", lead by a Bigmek called 'Kultek'. He remembered hearing of the battles they fought, the equipment they held, &amp;, most delightfully, the discipline they show. "ROIGHT DEN", he thought out (very) loud, "WEZ GOIN' TA AN'CORT"
   "UH, WERZ DAT, BOSS?", asked a navigator.
  "DAT WAY" Gritgutz responded, vaguely waving his Kustom Shoota in front of him. Pleased with himself, Gritgutz decided to reward himself with a gourmet meal prepared by his personal Grot chef team, living up to his name when informed that they lacked the necessary ingredients to do so.

Accidently went WOT in 6th Driving to work, music up loud so I couldn't hear my revs, thought I shifted into 4th for a pass, so I go WOT and realized 2 second later I have little power and I'm in 6th! I quickly let off the gas and go into 4th.

No odd noises (other than all 4 cylinders going to about -1.95). Did I do any damage,  or possibly cause LSPI to happen in the future? I can't help but be paranoid with my first turbo car.

If I Half throttle or more, i smell oil burning is this normal? First turbo’d car and not sure if this is normal or not. If I go half throttle or more I just smell burning oil, if I go WOT it almost burns my eyes and it’s super strong and lingers for a few minutes. Is this normal or should I drop the car off at the dealership again lol

Accessport, Ignition correction and misfires Recently picked up a COBB Accessport from stratified. While waiting on my flash tune from them I went and flashed to COBB's stage 1 91 octane map. The difference was noticeable and felt good. Although, as I researched what to monitor(ign corrections for cylinders 1-4, and knock count cylinder 1 &amp; 4) I began to worry. I found that not even going WOT I would sometimes see negative corrections, -3 being the lowest I'd seen along with knock counts as high as 5 for each cylinders. This was enough for me to flash back to stage 0 and wait for my stratified tune and I have noticed I barely get knocks and negative corrections. My first question is when going WOT is it normal for ign corrections to dip into the negatives then begin to rise? So the correction dip to say -2 then rise to +4. This was the case with me. This leads to my second question which has to do with the misfire count option. After flashing back to stage 0 I began to monitor misfires. From my understanding many ST's have misfires at idle, but in my case, on a cold start, I've seen 1-5 misfires shown and if I continue to idle the count will rise. The highest I've seen where 15+ misfires while warming up the car, which definitely does not seem normal. I'm currently waiting for stratified to email me my tune, and once they do I'm putting in one step colder NGK's spark plugs to see if it'll help on their tune. Nevertheless my questions remain. Thanks for your time!

I've included some logs. Still new to me so not sure if they're good logs though. Stage1: https://datazap.me/u/revitalisze/log-1524176320?log=0&amp;data=9-14

135i N54 Limp Mode WOT 2008 135i N54 goes into limp mode if I go WOT for like 3-4 seconds(about 5-6k RPMs) in 3rd/4th gear. Car runs perfect and pulls hard in 1st and 2nd but when I’m in third and get towards redline it goes into limp mode with the half engine light. Goes away on restart. Car cranks normal and is tuned with FOB from the previous owner. I’m buying a code reader this week to try and figure out the problem. Not really any shakes or stutters when it goes into limp mode. Car can’t get above 120 due to SES light coming on, usually comes on around 110-120. Car is perfect, no SES lights if I don’t rev it up high. Sometimes if happens while I’m building boost, other times it happens when I let off the gas to shift. Plugs and coils replaced fairly recently, upgraded injects and plugs are 1 step colder. Any ideas what the problem could be?

Clutch slipping at 20k miles on stock tune... Noticed my clutch slip passing a car in 5th with half throttle from around 3k rpm.  It will slip all the way down to 3rd gear if I'm 3-4k rpm and wot.  Must have been happening for a little while and I just started noticing it.  Anybody else have a bad time with the stock clutch?  Car was CPO and had 10k miles on it, maybe previous owner couldn't drive manual.  I assume I can't get this replaced under warranty, so I'll probably be going with the south bend stage 2 daily kit so I can go JB4.  Bummer, but at least I can tune it now.

Bog on WOT (2 stroke) I posted here a little while ago with some issues I had involving a 2 stroke Polaris 400l atv. The main issue was random, in patterned bogs. I've since tore the motor apart, replaced all gaskets and seals, fixed many issues internally (the previous owner was on the borderline of incompetent, this guy though window and door silicone would work as a gasket...)

I got everything put back together, bled the coolant, bled the oil pump, rebuilt the carb, etc. Etc.

Now, the motor sounds way healthier than it did previously, it idles properly, the coolant actually flows through the rad (water pump impeller was just spinning on the pump stud before, boy oh boy). But a big still remains. However, it is no longer random. It only occurs at WOT, and only after prolonged periods (15-20 seconds) of said WOT. once it bogs once, I can sit at 1/4-3/4 throttle healthily, but bogs immediately under WOT.

if it idles for ~5 plus seconds it will repeat the initial sequence, that is, WOT is healthy for 15-20 seconds, and then it bogs.

To me, this is most definitley fuel starvation, so, I double checked the main jet, clean as I left it. I adjusted the float level (the prolonged the time I could sit at WOT, but it still bogged). I checked that the fuel line/petcock was flowing good, it was. And finally, I check the vent lines, all clear. As a last ditch effort, I even drove with the fuel cap off to guarantee the tank vent wasn't too small, still bogged.

I highly doubt it could be and air leak (please, correct me if I'm wrong), because I replaced all the gaskets, everything looked great when I was tearing down/rebuilding the motor, Reed's were fine, carb boots were fine, etc. And I feel like an air leak would be noticed under any throttle position, except maybe idle.

Perhaps the gravity fed fuel delivery simply cannot keep up with the motor? Would it be worth putting in and trying a fuel pump? Mikuni has low pressure ones that work off of the carbs vacuum. This is what is used in my sled.

I'm no mechanic, but it does seem odd for a 400cc motor to be gravity feed, when my 600, which is not all that much bigger, is pressure fed.

Sorry for the long post.

KLR250 issues Bought a '95 KLR250 the other day with 2,900 miles.

Couldn't start it with the kick start, but bumping it would let you ride it as long as you kept the RPM's up. It'd be smooth to accelerate, but once you held it at a constant RPM, it'd take a dive in performance with a slight kick similar to engine braking on a thumper.

Pulled the carb, cleaned the pilot, emulsion tube, main, choke, etc.
Drilled out the brass cap and cleaned the pilot mixture screw.
Adjusted the float height to 17mm

Replaced the battery and spark plug.

Adjusted the valves between .008-.009

It's difficult to start, and when it will start it can idle for a period and then die out of nowhere. It'll accelerate strong, but if you hold the RPM's at a constant speed, it slightly bogs as if you're engine braking or running with a dead cylinder. It even sounds strange, almost like having a spark issue.



The issues...

The threads on the plastic nut for the choke have stripped so it's a loose fit in the carb.

Best I've been able to get as far as voltage across the ignition coil is 2v with a single kick.




Edit: I’ve replaced the ignition coil as the primary resistance was out of spec. It starts a lot easier now.

I’ve replaced the spark plug about half a mile ago and it’s BLACK.

I did a compression test and I got 180PSI at WOT. All the manuals I’ve read online said the threshold is 80-114 PSI???

I’ll try cleaning the carb for the third time.
Any suggestions?

2008 335i (N54) idle misfire/stalling Hey all. First post on this sub, but long time lurker.

I have been working with my girlfriends 335i that is exhibiting puzzling issues... all the issues began about 3 months ago with WOT misfires followed by limp mode. Restarting the car would fix the issues until WOT again. Found cylinder 5 injector was toast/leaking. Replaced that with a index#12, (yes I coded that accordingly) as well as brand new plugs as #5 was fouled to hell as well. Also at that time i replaced the valve cover gasket and spark seals as it was leaking down into the plug holes. After that the car seemed fine for a month or so, but with slight misfires or engine bobbles at idle. I didn't think much of it, until about 2 weeks ago the car started randomly stalling at idle, when sitting at lights, or parking lot. The engine just shuts down randomly... very smooth as if you simply turned the motor off using the push button start/stop. Sometimes it will refire just to stall again shortly after, and sometimes it will just crank and not start. The car was towed to the dealer as I was able to pull codes for HPFP issues and crankshaft sensor. Dealer replaced the HPFP and I did the crank sensor myself, as the dealer wanted ridiculous money for labor of course. (Took me a about $120 and a hour and a half) and now current time, the car will start fine when cold with the misfire at idle, but as soon as it warms up a bit it will stall and not refire. I'm at my witts end, and looking for some other things to check. I checked/cleaned the PCV valve as well, verified it to be a good valve.

Sorry for the long read all, just wanted to make sure I got all details in there. Thank you so much in advance!

Be us, all nobodies from different parts of the world lumped in with other nobodies

R. Lee Ermy's ancestor currently making us all regret our life choices

Messenger walks up and hands Sgt Johnson a letter

Tfw Big Mean Guy picks us 3 to accompany him

Told to follow him to his tent

Farrhin wants to shoot the shit instead

We start to converse

Drunk fuck walks up and promptly tells us to piss off

Callcious walks up to DS who is currently reading his paper that was given to him

Callcious just stands behind him like fucking predator

Asher stands next to Callcious

Sgt McFuck notices them and begins to speak but realizes something is off

Farrhin is not here

Farrhin is outside playing his flute

Angry Sgt man beelines toward him and chews him out

10 minutes in and Farrhin is already on someone's shit list

Sgt Biggus Dickus explains that we will be working with another guild member in a village called Troche

Children keep dissapearing

Embark on our journey

Troche is about a day's ride by carriage

Callcious and Farrhin hop in the back while Asher drives, wyvern rides shotgun

Callcious attempts conversation

Callcious asks Farhinn what the actual fuck he is

Farhinn is a type of golem called a doll, a living mannequin essentially

Farhinn says "what are you talking about I'm human"

He stares at Callcious with a shit eating grin

Roll for charisma

Farhinn has the highest charisma of our party

Callcious is persuaded

Farhinn plays his flute

Asher spots smoke in the distance

Closer inspection revealed a village had just been ransacked

Carriage comes to a halt and the party dismounts

Man approaches and asks if they're adventurers

Man is wearing all different kinds of gear that doesn't match

Obvious bandit is obvious

Asher tells him to "fuk off mate"

It should be noted that Asher speaks with an incredibly thick Australian accent

Bandit calls for his goons

Farhinn tries to de-escalate the situation

Asher is pissed, Asher is gonna fight

Asher threatens the man to give him all his stuff

Pass intimidation roll

"Now you're clothes"

Bandit is confused

"I said everything"

Bandit objects

Callcious rolls to intimidate

Nat 20

Picture tall ass lizard man who's cut as fuck staring down on puny insignificant man

Sheerterror.scripture

Bandit and goons strip and proceed to flee

Inspect village

One goon left behind

Goon is fucking a naked woman's corps

Sick bastard deserves no mercy

Callcious and Asher sneak up

Callcious makes a cutting motion across his throat

Asher comes up from behind and decapitates him

Executed before the Tribunal

Asher kicks his corpse for good measure

Back to the cart

Party feeling like badasses

Following trail through woods

Hear tapping noise under carriage

The fuck?

Investigate surrounding woods

Dense as hell but nothing suspicious

Tapping sounds again

"Oi Big Red, check that out will ya?"

Asher has affectionately given Callcious this nickname because of the prominent red stripe that runs down his body

Could be paint, or blood of his enemies

Probably blood

Callcious leans over the side

Nothing

Continue onward

More tapping

AllRightMotherFucker.jpg

Asher stops the carriage

Every one disembarks

Asher draws her sword

Callcious decides to investigate under the carriage

Two little elf children

Little shits try to act casual

Callcious threatens them with death if they do not come out

Children stare into the face of fucking godzilla

Promptly shit themselves and nope the fuck out

Back on the road

Farhinn is driving while Asher and Callcious nap

Arrive at Troche

Lady stops the carriage

Asks if we are from the guild

Guild hands out pendants to all parties deployed on a quest

She shows Farhinn her pendant

Farhinn uses magic to conjure up an apparition of our pendant

Lady asks for the real one to see if we're legit

Real pendant is aroumd Callcious's neck

Callcious is asleep

Farhinn, never to miss a moment to be an unsettling fuck, simply stares at her with his trademark shit eating grin

Aaher wakes up due to Callcious's snoring

Tells him to sod off

Lady notices the real pendant on Callcious

Takes party to inn

Asher promptly orders two bottles of rum and proceeds to get shit faced

Callcious goes to ask some bards if they know songs from his home land

Farhinn plays his flute

Lady realizes her back up has the attention span of fruit flies

After some assorted fuckery lady manages to get our attention

Her name is Claire Oathborne

Claire describes the situation with the missing children

Turns out she's a useless fuck who doesn't have any leads

Night falls

Claire and Asher get rooms

Callcious chooses to sleep under a table

Fuckin alligators man

What is our favorite creep Farhinn doing?

Watching Claire undress and go to bed

After getting an eye full he turns to Asher's room

He attempts to do the same thing

Farhinn peers through the key hole

He is met with a blue eye looking back out at him

It is Gungnir, Asher's Wyvern

Farhinn stares at it with his signature grin

Gungnir growls at him

Farhinn continues to stare

It growls again

Farhinn stares more

Suddenly Farhinn is blown back as a bolt of lightning shoots through the keyhole

A half dressed Asher swings the door open

"Wot the BLOODY HELL is..."

She stops when she sees Farhinn slouched against the wall

Guess who's still fucking grinning

"You fuckin wank stain" shouts Asher as she stands him on his feet

Asher goes to punch Farhinn

Asher is the second strongest in the group next to Callcious

Roll for punch

Nat 20

Asher upper cuts the soul out of Farhinn

Farhinn's face shatters as he's launched into the Nth dimension

Asher drags his unconscious body out the back of the inn and tosses him in an alley

She heads back to bed

The first session ends here

WoT Streamer E-Beggin for Heating System in Summer time LOL... I watched Orzanel in the past sometimes but now he asks for Donations (2000$) for a heating system in summer time LOL, yeah yeah!! i know nobody has to give him money and i dont need to watch him Bla bla bla... but still it seems very sketchy to even ask for something like a Heating system while living in Germany on his Stream, he has enough followers and donations already to live decent but now this is kinda Ridiculous to put on his channel, if it was winter and a Streamer said my heating system broke down and i cant really pay for it then yeah sure but in this case it is beyond Pathetic... i made a joke on his channel and he already got very pissed about it and he ordered a Ban... I said something like *lol you dont live in Romania anymore but in Germany* (in Germany the Landlord has to make sure your heating system works and if not you can pay way less Rent) but ofc if people get a taste for easy cash grab techniques then some go overboard out of sheer greed...

Engine numbers (Lycoming IO-360) As I explore YOLTbird, I'm trying to learn as much as I can about all the information I now have in the cockpit (FS-450, EDM-700, etc). Compared to YoloBird's 51-year-old Garwin cluster, I feel like I'm peering into her soul or something.

Sources:

[JPI Pilot's Guide](https://www.jpinstruments.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PG-EDM-800-Rev-W.pdf)

[Lycoming Operator's Manual](https://www.lycoming.com/sites/default/files/O-HO-IO-HIO-AIO%20%26%20TIO-360%20Oper%20Manual%2060297-12.pdf)

* **Oil temperature**. The EDM-700 flashes when it gets above 200°F (only happened during climbs), though the needle is still solidly in the green on the OEM gauge (redline: 245°F). Lycoming says the normal operating range is 180°F; JPI says 200°F (but that manual is not Lycoming IO-360 specific). If I'm seeing temperatures in the 206-208°F range, I'm thinking I should just keep an eye on oil temp, but not worry ... Or should I be actively taking steps to bring the temp down?

* **EGT temperatures**. I'm still getting the hang of properly leaning, especially since it seems like almost every power setting &lt; 10,000' is over 65% power, and even the most common settings at 10,000' (e.g., 2500 rpm at WOT with ram air open could be 20" MP, which is 65.8% power). Lycoming basically just says "*Maximum Power Cruise (approximately 75% power)* – Never lean beyond 150°F on rich side of peak EGT unless aircraft operators manual shows otherwise. Monitor cylinder head temperatures. *Best Economy Cruise (approximately 75% power and below)* – Operate at peak EGT." (p. 3-6) I'm seeing what I thought were high EGTs (&gt;1500), but if I'm reading the JPI information properly (p. 21), 1550°F is normal for a 200HP engine? (Listed as "high performance," but 1350°F is listed as the normal range for "*under* 200HP.) CHTs never got above about 367°F.

So much to learn ... Is [this course](https://www.advancedpilot.com/onlinesignup.html) worth $395?

335i Limp Mode/Long Cranks I'm at a dead end. Hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

Car:

2007 335i N54

JB4

MHD Backend

BMS DCI

Upgraded charge pipe w/ Tial BOV

Upgraded FMIC

Catless DP's

119,000 miles

I've owned the car for about 15,000 miles. Car was bone stock when I purchased it and was well maintained. 2 weeks ago the car unexpectedly went into limp mode while driving. The car started and drove normal the next day for ~20 min. While sitting in a parking lot the car shuddered, nearly stalled and lights came on indicating limp mode. I scanned the car with the Carly app.

Codes

3100: Boost pressure control shutdown

2D56: DME, internal error: Monitoring idling control (Note: this code has not
been recurring)

2A94: Crankshaft sensor signal

The car would now have long cranks when started and would stay in limp mode. After researching I decided to replace the crankshaft sensor signal. I changed the sensor last week and the car immediately started and ran like normal. Drove the car ~5 miles to go on a hike. Car started normal after the hike. On the way home, accelerating from a stop, the car stuttered and lights came on. It jerked the car pretty hard, felt as if i dropped the clutch without giving it power. Re-scanned the car and got the same codes, 3100 and 2A94 (Did not get 2D56). Frustrated, I searched all over again and found someone with a similar issue did not have their new sensor fully seated. I went out to go check and fired up the car but it turned on like nothing happened. Since then the car starts and drives like normal but goes into limp mode after about 20 minutes of driving. The car has no issues with WOT before it goes limp. Nothing particular seems to throw the car into limp mode except time.
My next step is to clean the VANOS solenoids. Research is pointing that it might be the cam bearing ledge, however, most people experiencing that are getting codes related to VANOS solenoids and go into limp mode after an agressive pull.

I'm stuck on where to look next and would appreciate any guidance or feedback. Thanks

[Help with layout]Making a small dIY sofa and can't decide where to put it in my tiny apartment. Hello everyone!

Been lurking (and sometimes contributing where I can) for a long while here, and now I need your help. I live in a small one bedroom apartment, and I have few stuff so everything fits nicely, until now.

I'm currently in the making of a pallet-based little sofa (47 inch wide), but I recently realized I don't know where I'll put it exactly. So I could use some advice about where to put it.

[This is my current layout, without the sofa](https://imgur.com/9loi0JD). Everything was drawn with the real sizes in mind, so what you can see there is what it actually is. And next are the ideas I've come up with, but I can't decide nor feel right with any of them.

- [Layout 1](https://imgur.com/Bu7UI5a). Here I used the fridge as a kind of divider between the dining area and the "living" area. Sometime in the near future I'll be buying a TV and could place it on the wall above the PC. Looks like a good idea, but don't know if the fridge would look good in the middle of the room and next to the sofa.

- [Layout 2](https://imgur.com/xAjhAvK). In this layout I moved the desk with the PC to my bedroom. Thing with this is, I don't feel so comfortable with the idea of having a computer in my bedroom. Don't want it to feel like a college dormroom.

- [Layout 3](https://imgur.com/yzIdrkN). This is what I first thought when started making the DIY pallet sofa. Seems like the best option, but can't yet decide if the fridge is well placed where it is, right at the entrance of the kitchen / living room.

- [Layout 4](https://imgur.com/Ae5pGpu). Here I moved the desk to the opposite wall and place the fridge and the little storage cabinet next to it. I think this is the best layout for the kitchen, using a whole wall to everything kitchen-related and the opposite one for everything else. The sofa was moved to the bedroom, thinking of it as a quiet reading / meditating space. When I buy the TV, I could place it in the wall in front of my bed, although I'm not sure yet if a TV has place in a bedroom anyways.

Considering the wall with the stoves is facing west, the south window is actually a sliding door leading to a balcony. Both south and north windows are a great light source.

Thank you for reading me so far, it's actually hard for me to believe I'm having such a hard time locating a small sofa. Guess so much time lurking here has made me a perfectionist (or wannabe) about home decorating. Any advice will be well received! Thanks in advance and sorry for the WoT.

2009 wrx hatch power loss around 4-5k rpm I noticed the problem a few days ago and tried searching nasoic and other websites but it seems the problem is pretty common and no thread has had a definitive answer.

What basically happens is when im in WOT in 2nd or 3rd my car will lose power at 4\-5k rpm and jolt forward a bit.

I have a Stage 2 tune with a Cobb SS3 Turbo back exhaust, Perrin air intake, gofastbits hybrid bov. the previous owner has a few mods to \(i think headers, up pipe and a external wastegate.\)

I'm going to start by swapping out my Bov with the stock one. Then I'll probably look into resetting the tune, the only thing I'm currently living in a pretty small town with no Tuner shops or anything.

Any help is appreciated

Hunting idle Hey everyone, a few weeks ago I got around to installing the schnitz racing klx needle + accompanying main jet. My carb settings are as follows, just to be clear:

- #140 Main Jet
- #2 Clip Position
- 1 ¾ Turn Mixture Screw
- Stock main jet

The bike runs great in the midrange and at WOT, but my idle seems to hunt a little bit now. occasionally, it will settle to about 1250 RPM, but othertimes rises to 1500 RPM. its not particularly consistent. additionally, it hangs sometimes when I blip the throttle, rather than the RPM declining smoothly. any ideas what insights this should give me regarding my AFR's? is idle circuit too lean or rich? not really sure how to diagnose and want a bit of input before i start turning fuel screw, adjusting clips, swapping jets, etc.

thanks!!

[TT] Three cranky old wizards meet up in the local tavern to complain about the next generation of magic users "Have you seen what those little shits now play with?", Grimalke belched out. He inspected his flask of mead and then laughed, the other two wizards laughing along.

"Oh heard this one, I have!! Sticks!!" shouted Laxut, the short bald man hitting the table. Their laughter increased in volume as the liquid splashed over his flask.

Ama stared into his empty flask incredulously, as if shocked that he had emptied it before guffawing.

"KEEP IT DOWN, YOU THREE!" The barman bellows from behind the counter.

Their laugh reduced in intensity as Grimalke raised a hand in apology. Laxut was still shaking as she tried to control himself. Ama let out a very gentle snore that almost sent Laxut over the edge.

"Sticks!! Sticks I tell you... they call them, get this, 'Wands'" Grimalke said.

"Wot? Wands? Wot th' hell's that?" Laxut asked.

"It's like hands but with the 'w' rune instead." Grimalke replied, taking a swig out of his cup.

"Well, ss' impractical that is... Wizards use staves."

"Aye... Staves are what make us, us. Wands... blagh."

"Bla-" Laxut belches before continuing "-agh indeed. I hear they just be shoutin' names 'nd not scripts like we do"

"Aye... Everything is now a word or a fancy hand wave. Back when we were learning, we had whole parchments to read and memorise..."

"Lazy that is... Lazy..." Laxut replied grumpily as he finished his mead.

"It's going to bite them in the rear, I say... The future of magic is in trouble" Grimalke ended with an angry sigh as he finished drinking. He slammed the cup on the table and got to his feet before looking at Laxut who had joined Ama.

Grimalke grimaced and sat back down.

The new set of mages his tower had gotten from the surrounding the villages were going to be a problem and he knew it. Ever since they got their hands on that scrying ball, they've been hooked to it. Picking up nonsensical tricks and ideas from others in the community.

"If only they spent all that scrying energy on learning some actual magic..." Grimalke grumbled before signalling to the Barman for a refill of his flask.

Tell the ref to throw in the towel as I'm f*"*"*g done. Hi all, :)

So I found out about her emotional affair on the first of April, 28 days ago.

Made my first post 24 days ago.

Made my second post 9 days ago.

Making my final post with regards to my now fully dead relationship today.

The last four months have been a horror story, I thought it was all my fault, turns out she spent over four months whoring about on facebook with a total of thirteen other men, (Hardcore Sexting, Images &amp; Video) there are thirteen other blokes out there who've seen the woman I love nude &amp; who've watched my wife pleasure herself for them, ,,, and I've spent the past 28 days telling her that its OK, telling her that I still love her, telling her that I forgive her, telling her that as long as we have honesty we can remain strong as the truth is the bedrock on which our rebooting relationship will eventually flourish.

She came home tonight &amp; after sitting for over 45:Mins she eventually told me they are closing her current office &amp; we will need to transfer &amp; move to a new location within the next couple of months, ,,, No problem I said.

She steps into the shower &amp; after handing her, her sponge, toothbrush etc I wander back into the living room, I absent mindlessly pick up her phone (I think I was simply checking the battery life &amp; I haven't looked at it for almost a week) anyway I open watsapp &amp; low &amp; behold there's a message from her boss dated the 23'rd April five days earlier informing her of the office closure &amp; asking her to choose a new location, FFS, ,,, is it me or wot?

She wanders into the room &amp; I ask her, (So you went into work this morning &amp; your boss just dropped the office closure bombshell on you?) she says yes &amp; then forges ahead telling me this elaborate story about being invited into the office &amp; offered a chair &amp; a cup of coffee etc &amp; how it was a complete bolt from the blue.

After confronting her she starts ranting that I'm over reacting &amp; this isn't the same thing, she doesn't seem to understand how damaging these lies are, or to put it another way once your discovered to be a liar the onus is on you to stop fucking lying &amp; prove to your partner that the only words out of your mouth are the truth, the absolute truth &amp; nothing but the fucking truth.

There's another big issue, over the years I've occasionally asked her for a BJ but the truth is she's not very good at giving them &amp; I know she's not really into them, ,,, the other night I asked her for one &amp; within sixty seconds I had to pull away as it was excellent, bitch felt like she could suck a golf ball through a garden hose, I'm sorry but in eighteen years its never ever felt like that &amp; I'm having real issues with her explanation of, (I was just trying harder than the past) one thing I've learned as I've been getting older, your either a natural at something or you need sufficient training but you sure as shit don't go from being bad to being good without practice as practice makes perfect &amp; she sure wasn't practicing that shit on me.

I was willing to work through this, I gave her forgiveness, I wanted to trust her again but its not to be, truth is I'm furious with myself as I think I could have done more I hate the fact that I'm to weak to keep trying but the past four months have ripped me apart and every new revelation is more than I can bear, I have nothing left but love for her but at this point its not enough as I know I need to GTF away from her asap, earlier I sat on the kitchen floor with my favorite chefs knife &amp; once I put it back in its sleeve I accepted the fact that I'm considering self harm and this is the red flag in which I have to call it a day.

So on Monday I'm off to sunny Scotland to crash at my friends flat whilst I look at new flats, if all goes smoothly I should be in my new place by the 14'th of May &amp; there will also be at least 500 Miles between us, I'd prefer further but it will do for a start, the day I move out I'm wiping out all of my social media &amp; popping a new sim in my phone as there's no way she's ever contacting me again, when I settle down in my new place I can finally have a good cry &amp; mourn the loss of the woman I loved, roll on three weeks, :)

I wish you all the best &amp; I hope your either happy or your working towards happiness as once you've been cheated on you deserve nothing but happiness, nothing more nothing less, oh and the weak ass morally repugnant cheaters deserve to wallow in the hell &amp; self pity they created for themselves, can I get a (*Fucking A* ,,, ummk rambling but happy thanks to all whov'e read my previous posts &amp; especially to those who reached out &amp; offered advice or PM'd me etc as you people helped me more than words can say, Thank you all.

Hi. 16/M/Europe, east Europe. Hello there. General Ke... oh sorry, my bad. Anyway, looking for friends or just some people to talk this day/night or longer.(from 14-18 male or female, I dont care).  (Beware of grammar mistakes lul).

So about me: I like to play games on PC, mostly strategy,ww2 games, realistic games. I dont play popular games like LoL, overwatch, CS:GO, Fortnite, because Im a noob on these games.


Some games that I play:
CoH2, CK2, HoI4, KSP, SWTOR (eu, english server), ETS2, Victoria2, WoT (eu server)and so on.

If I dont play games, I listen to sad music, because why not.(sometimes I listen to remove kebab song when I play certain games). :)


I like animals. Of course cats and dogs. I have a cat myself.

I speak english. I understand german, a bit of russian as well. When I was younger, I understood spanish as well. Now, not anymore.


I like some good old films: Some WW2 films, War of Worlds, The Martian, Life, Alien:Covenant, Star Wars films and so on.

I like politics (and memes), economics, history (1700-2018 mostly)(and memes).

I like most of the songs. From 1930-2000 (old ones), and some new ones. And like to sing some songs. :D Am weird.

I like Star Wars (memes, films, comics(legends and cannon).And of course some games.

I like to read (sometimes). Now I try to read a book by Winston S. Churchill. Its going vetter than expected. :)

I like to stay at home and dont go anywhere else, because why not, eh. And watch some memes or YT vids.


I like to talk about anything I guess.

I like to listen what people are talking. Because I dont know what topics to talk, so I usually let people speak and I listen to them with pleasure.
So if you can keep the convo going. Thats a bonus.

I like memes. Well not all. Maybe 98% just.

I can talk to people from USA (east coast) time zone to idk maybe Iran time zone. Lul.

But if it is necesary, i could talk to you from US (west coast) time zone to maybe Australians (east coast) time zone.


If you want to chat, PM me.

If we get along well than we could talk later on discord. If you dont want to thats fine for me. I will stay for a while, not sleeping(this day). So ayy.

So have a nice day/evening. If I dont reply, I will later or the next day. Usually I reply very fast, because Im always on the phone, even in school during breaks, sometimes if i can, during the lesson.

83 Volvo 245 sputtering I have an 83 Volvo 245 with an 81 redblock in it. Originally it was a diesel, but that got professionally switched out several years before I touched the car.

Recently, it's started sputtering at what feels like random times. I sprayed some carb cleaner in and used a fuel additive for cleaning that out. Since then, it's started sputtering:

N 2500 no throttle engine not warm warming up before driving

3rd gear 2750ish no throttle engine warm going downhill

2nd gear 4500 WOT engine warm racing off the light

2nd gear 1800ish 1/2 throttle engine not warm leaving an event

3rd gear 2000 1/4 throttle engine warm top of a hill

What should I check next, or what do these have in common for me to tell a mechanic "it happens when..."?

Shell 91 and negative corrections I've been running shell 91 fuel since installing my stratified tune and lately ive been seeing big negative corrections at wot. At first I thought a couple of my plug gaps were off since I was seeing the negative values and cylinders 2 and 4. Plugs were both within .001 of .026.. so I started to worry there was something wrong with my tune or my car. Turns out it was crummy gas. I switched to Chevron and the biggest correction I've seen is -1.5. shell produced a -7 at one point. I am in the SF Bay area. Anybody else have bad luck with shell?

Sam and Sam Roy - Kicking up a Storm ###Full Name(s) **-** Sameer and Samantha Roy

**Preferred Name:** Sam.  Both of them go by Sam.

---
---

**General Information**
-
-
**Age** - 32

-
**DOB** - December 21, GY129

-
**Place of Birth** - Silver city

-
**Appearance**

Which Half | Eyes | Hair | Skin | Height | Weight | Beard?
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
[Sameer](https://i.imgur.com/0vQYX6q.jpg) | Brown | Black  | Brown | 5”10” | 175lbs | A pretty decent one, too
[Samantha](https://i.imgur.com/LrzTtpY.jpg) | Grey | Black | Tanned |5’5” | 125lbs | U wot




Sameer can usually be seen wearing a lab coat over a whatever he feels like wearing at the time, usually a tee shirt and a pair of jeans and some sneakers. When forced to dress up, he wears a dark storm-grey blazer, a wrinkled blue button down and dress pants with a different novelty tie each time.  He doesn’t look particularly athletic, but isn’t exactly fat either.

Samantha usually wears a simple dark blue tactical jumpsuit with a comfy pair of combat boots. Her hair is straight and hangs down to just below her shoulders.  Although the two are actually about 35, Samantha only ages when out of the body and looks to be in her mid 20’s.

-

**Personality** - The two are near-opposites.  Sameer spends most of his time on his computer or working with Caleb on various gadgets. He’s well versed in Biology and Computer Science.  He’s bright and loves solving puzzles, but has ADD so he tends to not focus very well on things when he isn’t already interested in the work.  As a result, he tends to function best when given a problem or puzzle to focus on. He tends to be a bit messy and socially awkward, so he prefers to take a back stage role to things. However, he loves meeting new people and tends to be pretty friendly. He’s not really a man of few words by any means, but the words he speak tend to not be very well thought out. He tends to get kind of excited and ramble when talking about topics he likes, such as his many inventions. He has an almost fanboyish knowledge of pop culture, including videogames and certain comic book related media.   He’s super loyal to his friends and the people of HADOS, and isn’t above fighting anyone that tries to harm the people he loves.  The one thing he does that he could really call a sport is Archery, which he got into after reading about and watching numerous fictional Archers and realized that it didn’t actually involve much running.  His curious nature and general recklessness means that he sometimes needs to be rescued by Samantha.

 Samantha, on the other hand, lives for the fight.  She loves animals and exploring places, but her favorite thing is the thrill of battle.  She shares Sameer’s love for strategy games, but prefers violent games like laser tag or paintball to Sameer’s video games. She is smart and good at analyzing people.  She tends to come up as antisocial and intense, but once you get to know her she’s still pretty intense.  However, she does become a bit more friendly as she warms up to someone. Her sentences tend to be short and to the point, but she has been known to be pretty friendly to people she knows well.  Due to her relative ease with speaking to people, she tends to be the pairs go-to person for interacting with people.  She is easily bored, however, so if she feels like there’s nothing to do she simply merges back with Sameer.  Her fiery personality means that she can and will beat up anyone who gets in her way.  She’s especially protective of Sameer and tends to be fiercely competitive. Despite her general aura of toughness, she has a soft spot for animals.  Like all well-off teenage girls from movies, she once befriended a race horse named Mar.

**Philosophy** - Sameer tends to be pretty pacifistic in general, and prefers to do things with the help of the authorities.  Samantha, on the other hand, likes to do things undercover and generally doesn’t care for authority.  While technically still Lawful, Samantha doesn’t hesitate to beat up her enemies before turning them in.

**Profession:** Sameer works with Caleb as the resident R/D Tech while Samantha is the Reconnaissance Teacher.

-

**Backstory** - It’s not entirely clear what happened that day in Silver City, but the superhero duo Typhusion had been expecting twins. Only one child was born that day. Roughly two years and a flash of light later, a hapless and rather frazzled babysitter suddenly found herself having to charge by the toddler.  Only a few years later, the pair had already established themselves as complete opposites.  Sameer would be regularly picked on for being the skinny Indian kid, only for Samantha to show up and make them regret it.  Samantha developed a love of fighting, while Sameer went more towards STEM. The pair eventually grew tired of their life at home.  With their parents out doing superhero work all day, Sameer grew tired of the monotony of doing the same thing every day and wanted a chance to use his powers to make a difference.  Samantha, meanwhile, wanted more chances to fight and prove herself.  They quickly rose through the ranks at the academy and graduated.  Afterwards, Sameer went to college to a PhD for himself while Samantha honed her fighting skills.  They spent a few more years following the path of their parents, with Sameer as the man in the chair for Samantha, before accepting a job at their Alma Mater as teachers.  Now, they spend their days helping train the next generation of heroes.

-

**Equipment** - Sameer’s equipment tends to consist of various miscellaneous electronics, including his computer. When he fights, he prefers to use his powers and his bow as well as a flat piece of metal for flying.  He has back up arrows just in case.  [His super suit](https://i.imgur.com/SNL0ptp.jpg) consists of a lightly armored dark blue fabric with golden highlights in the shape of lightning bolts.  It is made to provide thermal insulation as well as protection against bullets and melee weapons.  It contains a helmet with a golden visor for the eyes.  Plastic is placed at strategic intervals to keep the suit light and allow conduction of his abilities through the suit.

When Samantha uses weaponry she uses a small taser or, on occasion, a gun that uses sticky foam bullets.  She has a back-up sword just in case.  She has also been known to make use of ball bearings.  Her suit is a dark padded jumpsuit similar to what secret agents might wear.    It contains a tool belt for carrying the various equipment she may use.  She also wears padded gauntlets over her arms and goggles with night-vision functionality.

**Powers**
-

**Major Power** - Fission-induced Element Manipulation

Sameer and Samantha share a body, but they can split apart into separate bodies.  The energy produced by the fission can be harnessed by them to manipulate electricity and wind.  When apart they have the powers of Electrokinesis and Aerokinesis, respectively. Due to their unique link, they are able to communicate mentally from wherever they are, although they cannot see what the other sees unless they are fused. They are still separate people and do not share memories, though. Additionally, Samantha only ages physically when the two are split.

Their power functions almost like a battery.  The longer they stay in one body, the more the power charges up.  After a full charge, or about 8 hours worth of time, their abilities are the greatest.  Their powers start weaken after about an hour, and reach their lowest point after about a day.  The powers drain faster after heavy usage.

Sameer’s electrokinesis allows him to sense the electricity flowing through objects from up to about 50 feet away.  He is able to use this ability to sense nearby electronics and figure out the function based on how the electricity moves inside them.  Additionally, he is able to send out bolts of electricity, which he channels through a bow to increase the range. He is also able to electrify regular arrows to extend the duration of the powers. He is able to charge objects with this electricity, but has to be careful so he doesn’t burn them out or greatly accelerate the rate of his power drainage.  He is able to absorb electricity from other sources to slow the rate of his power drainage.  When his power is at max, he is able to create jets of plasma that can cut through metal.  At max charge, he can also electromagnetically move objects and magnetize metallic objects.  At max charge, he can also use the electricity around him to levitate and fly.  Once he gets weaker, he can only fly by magnetically levitating over metal objects through the aid of a metal platform.  This method of flying only allows him to fly up to 10 feet off the ground, and even then only if he strains himself.  He is also able to short out electronics through sending out electromagnetic pulses or blasts of lightning, but he can only send out pulses while near max.

Samantha’s Aerokinesis allows her to send blasts of wind out that can move or slice objects from a distance.  She can use this power up close to create blades out of air that can more finely manipulate objects. She is able to sense the movement of air around her in a 50 foot radius.  This allows her to detect disturbances such as sudden bursts of wind or fast movement in the area.  She can create gusts of wind that knock back people in all directions.  These can be manipulated at max charge to allow her to fly.  Even at other times, these gusts can be manipulated to allow her to leap long distances, glide and wallrun.  She can create cushions of air to slow her fall or to slow down blunt objects in motion.  She can manipulate pressure more directly when at max charge, allowing her to create small vacuums or areas of high pressure to pull apart or push together weak objects.   This also allows her to propel objects off of the ground.  She can create headwinds or tailwinds, allowing her to slow people down or speed them up.  She can use her powers to lighten footsteps or muffle sounds.

-
**Minor Power** - Increased time perception

As a side effect of the powers, Sameer and Samantha are able to perceive time about 2x as fast as the average human.  For Sameer, this simply means that he is able to think fast.  This essentially translates to being able to learn things a bit faster than others do.  For Samantha, this translates to faster physical reflexes.  This power still functions even when the two are fused.

-

**Weaknesses and Drawbacks** -  Because their powers depend on them being split, they are nearly powerless when fused together.  Sameer retains the passive electricity perception and the movement perception when they are fused, but for obvious reasons only he retains the power. When split, their life forces are still connected.  If one is injured, the other feels it.  Sameer’s Electrokinesis and electricity detection can be blocked by effective insulators, while any sufficiently heavy object renders Samantha’s Aerokinesis useless.  She can only detect movement if there is an uninterrupted path of air between her and the movement.  Any thick object such as a wall may block the power.  While it is useful to gain twice the regular amount of information at any given time, it also means that they perceive events to be twice as slow as normal relative to others.  Between Sameer’s ADHD and Samantha’s short fuse, this means that events perceived as boring by most people would be almost torturous for these two.

-

**Resistances** - The pair’s unique physiology renders mental attacks less effective against them.  Sameer is immune to almost any electricity effect.  His super suit is also resistant to slashing damage such as knives and is known to slow down small arms fire.  Additionally, focusing on blocking metallic weapons allows him to potentially deflect slow bullets and metal weapons.  Samantha is able to deflect or slow down bludgeoning weapons.  Additionally, she is able to easily dodge slower ranged attacks because she is able to sense them ahead of time.

*Sam trudges up the steps to Hados, carrying a large hiking backpack that looks to be more than half his size. He stumbles on one of the steps, prompting Samantha to pipe up from inside his head.*

&lt;”Hey dumbass, you missed a step.  Speaking of which, couldn’t Connor have splurged for a private jet or something? That bus took its sweet time getting here.&gt;

“...You were asleep the entire time.”


----

*As they talk, Sam eventually reaches the top of the steps, out of breath and clearly hating every second of it.  He starts down the hallways to his office, ready to take a nap of his own.*

-2.45 Fine Knock Learn and slight whining noise after timing belt replacement at WOT? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17L8ymckZXF0a8yjIAs3uicKC2Caz_LIyDNwWuqZlYLc/edit?usp=sharing

* '13 impreza wrx
* It seems to only happen at 100% throttle. It didn't use to do any of this w/ the original timing belt (an other original parts)

* I'm using Cobb OTS Stage 2+ tune (w/ associated cobb parts)

* I had the timing belt replaced w/ one by blue gates, and had all the associated parts (bearings, water pump, etc.) replaced w/ OEM parts.

* The DAM value doesn't move from 1.000. I've read that this means I'll be fine, is that true in this case?

Should I flash the ECU w/ the stage 2+ tune again? I'm planning on getting a protune pretty soon, in case you're wondering.

Is my 7970 dead? Some games like siege, WOT would crash after maybe 20\-30 mins and bunch of green pixels would appear and make a really loud buzzing sound, i cant do anything besides turn my computer on and then when i turn it back on the booting screen would appear some artificial green pixels but some games like league would play just fine. Is my graphics card dead?

Breaking up with your Sentient Weapon &gt; Be me, +2 Sentient Battleaxe

&gt; End up in Red Dragon's horde after a series of poor life choices, seemed like a good idea at the time

&gt; Red Dragon growing sick and frail. Not the drake he used to be. Never wants to polish me or marvel at me anymore

&gt; Barely a 'good morning' these days

&gt; MFW adventurers break in

&gt; Big grumpy dragonborn fuck yelling at his friends not to touch anything

&gt; Adventurers NOT stealing anything that isn't nailed down. Must be a dream.

&gt; MRW someone fucking picks me up.

&gt; A week passes, am strapped to the hip of some scrawny half-elf beta

&gt; Bloody Ranger multiclass of some kind.

&gt; Calls me 'Bianca' like I'm a pet or something.

&gt; Wizard knows what I am. Refuse to speak to anyone, anyway.

&gt; Dicking around in some temple complex, barely being used in combat at all.

&gt; Ranger nagging me to talk to him. Finally do so, just to get him to shut up. He smiles a big, stupid smile.

&gt; Stupid Ranger and his stupid goofy smile.

&gt; Fight our way through temple complex, actually getting a little bit of use. Feeling good, getting back into shape.

&gt; Can't believe this shit

&gt; I'm having a good time

&gt; Not always in use, and even then - dragonborn fighter and hafling paladin are doing most of the work.

&gt; Still having a good time with Ranger

&gt; Ranger levels up - turns out he had 2 levels in fighter all this time

&gt; MFW he picks Eldritch Knight

&gt; MFW he starts talking about weapon bond

&gt; Metaphorical heart pounding

&gt; Proverbially sweating

&gt; Oh my god, is he going to ...?

&gt; Another day passes. He hasn't weapon bonded to me.

&gt; Confused

&gt; Why

&gt; He's barely used me since he levelled up

&gt; Hey, what's that fancy-looking longsword on his other hip? Wasn't that the sword he was using ten minutes ago when-

&gt; ...

&gt; Oh god

&gt; Heartbreak

&gt; Confront him

&gt; You've bonded to that Schiavona bitch, haven't you!?

&gt; That Venetian whore!

&gt; What does she have that I don't?

&gt; He tries to defend himself

&gt; Not having any of that shit

&gt; Don't you dare try to deny it! I saw you reaching up that fancy hand-guard!

&gt; I shit you not, he looks directly at me, and says

&gt; "I won't have to reach. My weapon bond means she can can appear right in my hand"

&gt; You fucking pig

&gt; Oh god

&gt; You've been dual wielding this entire time, haven't you!?

&gt; How could I have been so blind!?

&gt; Admit it, I've always been in the off-hand haven't I?

&gt; He tries to backtrack

&gt; Claims he always wielded me in his main hand

&gt; LIAR

&gt; "It's true! The sickle was in my off-hand"

&gt; u wot

&gt; There was a sickle too?

&gt; You stooped to *hookers*?

&gt; How many others were there

&gt; HOW MANY OTHERS, RANGER?

&gt; He starts counting his fingers

&gt; Merciless

&gt; Heartless

&gt; How could he be so cruel?

&gt; Fuck you, ranger

&gt; Have it your way

&gt; I'm going to tell all your other weapons what you've been doing

&gt; Have fun fighting hand-to-hand for the rest of your wretched life

Mercury 402 (1970-ish) won't start Hi, first of all I'd like to apologize for any poor spelling/grammar. English isn't my first language and I'm exceptionally lost when it comes to (boat) engine parts.

I own an old mercury 402 that has been a pain in the ass since I got it. Last summer I got an old fisherman to fix the engine, although a week later when i tried taking it for a ride I got about 500 metres out from the bay and then the engine slowly revved down and finally died. Since then it hasn't started. Now I have brought it up to my lawn and I'm trying to fix the issue. Both of the cylinders have a blue spark that I think should get it running. But, after trying to start the engine with WOT and choke enabled it the plugs still seems to be totally dry. I followed the fuel line in to the carburetor and removed it from the float cover. And fuel was coming through there. I then started removing the carburetor and cleaned it, the put everything back together and still nothing. I repeated this procedure of disassembling and puzzling back together the carburetor for 2 more times. Now it still won't start, although the engine does occasionally "puff" now after the cleaning.

I't shouldn't be the fuel pump either because I tried to squeeze the bladder while trying to start it.

Does anyone know what to try next?

From The Skripals To Douma, The Globalist Pravda Network Reveals Its True Face [_Authored by Rob Slane via TheBlogMire.com,_](http://www.theblogmire.com/from-the-skripals-to-douma-the-globalist-pravda-network-reveals-its-true-face/)

People living in the Soviet Union had a wonderful phrase to describe the two biggest circulation state-controlled newspapers, _Pravda (meaning “truth”) and Izvestia (meaning “news”) **-**_**there’s no truth in Pravda and no news in Izvestia, was the oft-repeated expression.** It is unfortunate that the mainstream media in the Western nations these days don’t have similar sorts of names, since it deprives us of an endless source of amusement in coming up with similarly apposite phrases about them.

[](https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/GPN-1080x548.png?itok=SDil7p4a)

**It is, however, increasingly clear that on the great issues of the day, you are about as likely to find the truth in them as you would have done in Pravda,** although I expect their sports and gardening sections are still relatively reliable. As for the important political and geopolitical issues of the day, I tend to imagine that on the walls next to the desks in the offices of many of these papers and broadcasters are the following instructions:

**Rules for Reporting on Global Affairs**

  1. Repeat Government line unquestioningly.
  2. If Government line is questioned, accuse those doing the questioning of being Bots, Kremlin-trolls and useful idiots.
  3. If the persistent questioning won’t go away and the Government line is seen to be contradictory and full of holes, bury the issue completely and start posing deep questions, such as “What will Meghan wear?” or “Is there a gender pay gap in midwifery?” or “How much sugar is really bad for you?”

**The Skripal and Douma episodes have demonstrated this perhaps more than any others.**

First the Government line has been dutifully **parroted** by the media in a relentless propaganda campaign — no questions asked.

Then there have been attempts to **silence or ridicule** those who didn’t bow to the parrots and who were asking legitimate questions — [including the appalling treatment meted out to distinguished military men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ygdfiL61WU).

And finally, both issues now appear to have **been “disappeared” down the Memory Hole,** apparently to be forgotten forever and ever.

**This last point is so obvious in the Skripal case that it has caused [some to speculate](https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/04/probable-western-responsibility-for-skripal-poisoning/) that the British Government has slapped a D-Notice on the case (this is a formal notice to the media to limit their coverage of the story on grounds of “national security”).** I can hardly help thinking of that without giving a horse laugh. A D-Notice to stop the media reporting on the case on the grounds of national security? What’s funny about it is that all the media has done since day one of the case is to endlessly repeat the Government line on absolutely everything, even when that line became so utterly ludicrous that believing it required one to hold [a number of contradictory and irreconcilable thoughts in one’s head at the same time](http://www.theblogmire.com/the-uk-governments-skripal-conspiracy-theory/).

In other words, if there is indeed a D-Notice on the issue, which seems very likely given the fact that there is now almost zero coverage of the case in the British media, it can have nothing to do with national security, _per se_, since from the get-go it was clear that the media had no interest in investigating any of the claims made by Government. The Government line was perfectly safe from being questioned by those who are apparently not able to report on it now, and so one can only conclude that it is because the Government line is so obviously full of holes that reporting on it needed to be stopped, lest increasing numbers of rational people recognised it to be somewhat barking.

**It’s a shame really. I began to look forward to seeing what each day’s new dose of cock and bull would bring forth.** They were poisoned at the restaurant. No the car. No the cemetery. The flowers. No, it was in the luggage. No, the bench. No, it was porridge. No, no, no! It was on the door handle, and it was liquid, which although tending to be runny, remained there for three weeks, even in all that rain and snow, in highly pure form, and you know the amazing thing is that people without protection stood just feet away from it, and they are fine. Whoda thunk it? But it is military-grade nerve agent “of a type developed by Russia” nonetheless. Seriously guv.

Oh and they’re in a coma. Sergei and Yulia, that is. Likely to die they are. A judge will probably have to take the decision to switch off their life support. **Oh hang on, Yulia’s on the phone. Yes of course she is. She’s fine. Sorry we forgot to mention that before when we were talking about the life support machine. And Sergei’s okay too. Yes we can confirm that. Sorry we didn’t mention that before either.** But he’s unable to talk. So you won’t hear from him. Or her. He’s in the hospital, though. Probably. Don’t know where she is. Not to be disturbed though.

_**Oh and there’s the policeman at the bench. Sorry, we meant the house. The house and the bench. Which one?**_How on earth should we know? Both probably. At the same time. But he can’t talk either.

What is particularly funny is that [according to Mark Sedwell](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/no-suspects-yet-in-skripal-nerve-agent-attack-mps-told), the UK’s National Security Advisor, certain classified information – such as the apparent door handle delivery method – was released in order to “counter Russian disinformation”. Ah so it was Russian disinformation that took us from the restaurant to the car to the cemetery to the flowers to the luggage to the bench via the porridge and finally (finally???) to the door handle (I say “finally???” only because nobody has yet suggested the cat as the conduit for the poison)? So it was Russian disinformation that tried to sell us the idea of a slow-working, lethal yet non-lethal, military-grade nerve agent that enables its victims to go to restaurants, make them hallucinate and then be as right as rain a few weeks later? So it was Russian disinformation that told us that after studying hours of CCTV footage, [British intelligence had a suspect in the case](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/former-spy-codenamed-gordon-identified-12404228) – the dashingly handsome, astonishingly intelligent, and diabolically ruthless former KGB agent, codenamed “Gordon” or was it “Cecil” or “Squiffy” or something, with a penchant for martial arts and (who can doubt) fast cars and loose women – only for Mark Sedwell to tell MPs a week later that there is no suspect, there never has been a suspect, and the investigation has been hampered by lack of CCTV footage?

**Russian disinformation? Alas no. It was the UK media wot did it.** They managed to put about more disinformation, stuff and nonsense, and cock and bull in a month or so than 10,000 “trolls” working 16 hour shifts in a basement in St. Petersburg could have done in a decade. And so you can see why the Government might want to slap a D-Notice on it, can’t you? Except that it should obviously be a C-Notice, the C standing for Comedy.

**As for Douma, the media excelled itself there as well.** There we have three Governments, apparently dropping bombs on chemical weapons depots in response to an unproven chemical weapons attack, and not one journalist in the mainstream media thought to say, “Hang on a minute! You dropped bombs on what you thought was a chemical weapons depot? Isn’t that … em … a tad on the dangerous side? Toxic fumes and people in the surrounding area becoming contaminated and all that?”

And when nobody became contaminated, not one mainstream media journalist thought to ask, “Hang on a minute! Isn’t the fact that there was no release of toxic substances into the atmosphere when you bombed it sort of like evidence that … em … how can we put it … there weren’t any toxic substances there?”

And when one of the little boys and the doctors in the “chemical attack” video that the Western Governments used as a pretext to bomb a sovereign country and spook us into wondering whether WWIII was about to start — when they turned up alive and well in The Hague to testify that there was no chemical attack, did even one mainstream media journalist think to themselves, “Maybe it would be good to hear what they have to say, since they were there?” Alas no. Some moved onto number 2 in the Rules for Reporting on Global Affairs, denouncing with barely concealed fury the testimony of the very people who had appeared in the original video that had once seemed so persuasive to them, whilst others moved onto number 3, and started talking about what Kim Kardashian has been up to lately.

**It is clear that there is a deep sickness at the heart of the media.** The whole point of its existence is to investigate incidents, to go where the facts lead it, and to serve ordinary people by attempting to report and reveal what is true. **And above all that, it is to act as a check on the overweening state, so that it does not feel that it has carte blanche to do whatsoever it wishes.**

But the handling of these two major cases has shown perhaps more than ever before that it has no intention of doing these things. It will not investigate, it has no intention of revealing inconvenient facts, and it cares little for the truth. And above all, instead of acting as a break on the state and on Government recklessness, its chief concern now appears to be doing the bidding of a very powerful group of Globalists, defending and advancing their diabolical agenda, regardless of what is and what isn’t true.

_**What should we call such a media that seems to have little or no regard for the truth, and which collectively serves the interests of the Global elite? Mainstream? Globalist Pravda Network seems to me to be a more accurate description.**_

Nomonhan night! Driving blind! Well yesterday was interesting, bright sunlight coming into my living room, and for the first time I have played Nomonhan NIGHT! Yikes! So dark I could not see anything! I feel most of the battle was luck. My E 50 did though ram a TD (cannot remember what type) flipped him on his side, then continued to flip him on his top (BOOM) and then drove up and over him. That was very entertaining to say the least. I have played Nomonhan many times in snow, but not night. I usually play WOT when it is dark outside so I can actually see where the hell I am driving with night maps. I should have saved that clip of the TD kill.

Almost blew up my engine. A cautionary tale for my fellow ecoboost owners. So last night I was doing a log and noticed at around 5k rpm my fuel pressure drop a 1000psi and my car leaned way out. Came across this thread.

http://www.mustangecoboost.net/threads/ecoboom-info-from-adam-via-facebook.13545/

And as it turns out it appears my low pressure fuel sensor is probably bad. At idle I'm reading 109psi. I'm headed to Ford today to pick up the part and I can report back if my issue is resolved.

This can create very dangerous conditions at WOT and I highly recommend if you have means of data logging to run these tests and if you do not then I would say go ahead and replace the sensor. It's not an expensive part.

Well, the film forum happens on Sunday nights. Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays too! It's pretty relaxed for the most part. I set the room, make the coffee, put out the snack, and then I just hang out until the movie ends.

This of course leaves me with a couple hours where I'm either messing about on reddit, watching YouTube, or play WoT. Tonight I'd like to mix it up a bit and that's where you come in!

What can we chat about? Literally almost anything you'd like. I'm up for getting to know someone new and seeing where it goes. We can definitely talk about movies too. Have you seen anything good lately? Or is there one that feels like you're the only one who's seen it?

Anyway, I have to start getting ready now, so if you're interested just PM your kik and I'll kik you later!

PSA: Check your throttle cable for slack I was binging some EricTheCarGuy last night. One of his videos was about tightening up a loose throttle cable. So I went out and checked my bugeye and it had quite a bit of slack. I used a 12mm wrench and fixed the slack within a few minutes. WOT feels better now. and I like removed play from the gas pedal. I even snugged up the cruise control cable as it also had some slack. Just be careful to not over tighten the throttle cable which could leave your throttle open even when you don't have the gas pedal pressed.

People 'parking' their things on the chairs by the pool/sauna/steam room I got in the whirlpool the other day in my gym and noticed that out of the 4 chairs somebody had 'parked' a large water bottle, and somebody else had 'parked' a towel and bits and bobs, so 2 chairs.

All I can think about as I am sat in the whirlpool is that when I have had a swim and a steam room and a shower will there be anywhere to sit for all of 2 minutes to cool off.

I couldn't relax in the Jacuzzi as I was thinking about that bottle of water, looking around for the person who left it. I'm thoroughly British so the confrontation would have gone thusly

Person returns to pick up water bottle parked on chair \- I stare at them long enough for them to be uncumfortable and then stare at their bottle of water.

If they are British they would

a\) Realise that they had done wrong and adopt the 'I am ashamed of my actions today' look

b\) Said ''Wot U Lookin At'' \- In which case I would have adopted the ''I apologise profusely' look

If they aint British then that's a Spanner in the works and I would

a\) Apologise to myself

Turned out that the Bottle of water was unatached and free,some time later I witnessed the staff enter the pool area to inform that the club would close soon  And then watched bemused as the bottle of water was removed from the chair by the cleaner

Datalog question - 3rd gear WOT pull 2018 WRX - Turbo back, TGV delete, EBCS, Stage 2 etune
I've been trying to study my datalogs to get a better understanding of the data and my cars performance. I know about monitoring Feedback Knock, Fine Knock Learn, MAF Corr.  But what are some ways to monitor speed or power performance/improvements? Like a lot of folks.... i wanna know simply if my car is getting faster.

Because of lack of knowledge of something better to monitor.....I was keeping an eye on my 50-80 times.  But was surprised to see no improvement from Stage 1 to now (staying right around 4.2 seconds). I do the pulls in the same location and has been around the same temps.

Is this a pretty bogus thing to monitor? Anyone have advice?

2008 GTI FSI CEL for Misfire- Hopefully not Cam follower wear? Hi r/GolfGTIJust picked up an '08 GTI after months of searching. Unfortunately on the way home I suffered a flashing CEL going uphill in 2nd gear near WOT. Been able to drive normally around the city since then without any issues. I have an appointment scheduled to throw new spark plugs and R8 coils in soon, and my OBD2 scanner is in the mail to check the codes...the previous owner said they had "no issues" with the cam follower, I am super paranoid, so what's the likelihood that this CEL is due to a worn cam follower? I'm hoping the dealership can expect for me at the appointment I have booked \(I would check myself but don't have the tools or time right now\). Car's got around 150k km on it, Stage 1\` tune and APR intake.

Boost issues/car feels sluggish - bouncing boost in 5th and 6th, car seems to be underboosting...PFA (Stage 2+ UM MK6 R) &lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/VDgeT01"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/VDgeT01"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Stage 2+ UM MK6 R here, I recently hit 80k, and had a bevel box failure, which was replaced. After the replacement of the bevel box I've started to notice that I'm under boosting (should be getting around 22-24psi, getting around 18-21 psi). It may not seem noticeable numbers wise, but the Butt Dyno tells me otherwise. I'm not throwing any lights, it doesn't appear I have a vac leak (seems to hold -22hg under vac, maybe with a small bit of dither). What I do notice is it feels considerably different, and I've also noticed that my boost tends to bounce a lot in 5th and 6th with WOT. Even a touch in 4th this morning. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I have a feeling maybe the wastegate or turbo might be on the fritz? Looking for any sort of input before I drag her out to a shop for the full run down..again. It's almost summer, and I really want to have all the fun I can with my R :)

Ignore this - just a test - will be deleted soon Has Anyone Read ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’?

Apparently there’s a joke book called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’, and I was wondering if anyone here had heard of it, because I seriously want to get my hands on a copy.

I’ve been into dark humour for as long as I can remember. No topic is off-limits. Terrorism. The Holocaust. Dead babies. Whatever. I don’t care about things being offensive; as long as it’s a good joke, I’m up for it.

So when I heard about ‘1000 Dark Jokes’, I knew I wanted to read it. The problem is, it doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. I’ve searched for hours online, I’ve looked on Amazon and Waterstones, I’ve scoured the local bookshops and libraries (Side note – I discovered that libraries are still a thing!). I even contacted some of the biggest libraries in the country and asked them to search through their stock. Nothing. There wasn’t a scrap of evidence that this book had ever been written.

Except for one forum.

It’s one I’ve been lurking in for a long time, but never got around to posting in. A celebration of grim jokes and gross-out humour. It’s where I’ve read some of the best material I’ve ever come across. And some of the most downright awful.

It’s called RapeAndPunnage.org

As I was browsing through it a few weeks ago, I stumbled across this old thread, which is the only mention of ‘1000 Dark Jokes’ that I’ve been able to find anywhere. I thought of trying to summarise it for you lot, but I may as well just copy/paste the whole thread – it’s not that long – and hopefully someone here will be able to give me some pointers. Who knows, you might even recognise a username or two!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I found a book today in the second hand shop at the bottom of my street. It caught my eye because of the title, and straight away I thought of you lot. It’s a jokebook, with a blank front cover, and the title in embossed, silvery-black print down the spine. It’s called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’.

&gt;I’ve read a few now. They don’t seem to be what I’d call ‘jokes’. More like… statements. Or like –

&gt;Okay, I’ll type a few out and show you what I mean.

&gt;*#0001 – A man walks up to his doctor. “Help me,” he screams, “my lungs are burning!”. He collapses to the floor, and begins to cough blood onto the doctor’s new shoes. The doctors spits on him and laughs.*

&gt;That’s it. That’s the first joke in the book. I read it about a dozen times trying to see what I’d missed, whether there was a pun I wasn’t getting or something. But that really does seem to be it. And they’re all like that.

&gt;*#0012 – An old lady sits on a quiet beach. In the distance, she sees a flock of birds gliding past. She weeps, for she knows she will die alone.*

&gt;And #0017 is just *A baby dies in agony*.

&gt;I have to admit, I did actually laugh at some of these. Not because they’re funny, but just from the sheer audacity of someone publishing this as a jokebook. But I’ve found I really enjoy reading through it, a couple dozen jokes at a time, while I’m on the bus or whatever. Do any of you guys own ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? Is there something I’m missing?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;LOL! Nvr heard of it but it sounds lik an absolute MINDFUCK! Got to get me a copy!! XD

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Its bettr thn any jokes uv evr cum up wth u pussy f@g!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;JITO, you’ve been warned before. Contribute to the discussion or not at all.

&gt;FG1988, I was really interested to see this get posted up. My sister had a copy of this, and we used to read it together after mom and dad had gone to bed. We were way too young, looking back. It’s probably what started me liking all of this sick shit come to think of it! Anyway, I’ll see if I can dig it out from somewhere. Out of interest, have you carried on reading it? Got any favourites?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Haha, can’t imagine a little kid reading this stuff! Some of it is proper intense! Do you remember the one about the cat, I think it was thirty-something. Just a really detailed description of it being murdered.

&gt;My favourites are probably the ones that are less gruesome and more bizarre – they sort of leave you stunned for a moment wondering how anyone thought to print it!

&gt;Like *#0143 – A rich man and a poor man are standing on top of a mountain. The poor man says to the rich man, “We only have enough food to get one of us down the mountain”. The rich man says, “Yes, you should take it and go.” The poor man cries with gratitude, and promises to make a shrine to the rich man upon his arrival home. When the poor man is part way down the mountain, he is set upon by savage wolves, and killed. The rich man is among them. He feasts.*

&gt;I’ve just got this really funny mental image of the Monopoly Man covered in wolfskin, calmly cutting into a human arm with a knife and fork!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Huh. I partly remember that one. I thought it ended with something like “the rich man watched from a distance until he starved to death.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;I like number 399. ‘A nun is raped. She screams and screams, but it does not stop. She bleeds onto her robes, and dies. Her god is a lie.’

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Fucking PWNED lol!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;“Her god is a lie.”

&gt;Hey, I take offence to that! ;P

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I’ve got it! Our old copy of 1TDJ. It’s dusty, and it’s definitely seen better days, but it’s just about held it together. I’ve found the joke I was remembering from earlier.

&gt;Number 679: *A dog loved its owner very much. One day, she lay down some food before it. The dog wanted the food very much, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down more food. The dog was very hungry, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down even more food. The dog was in terrible pain, but the owner did not let it eat. The dog watched the food. The dog smelled the food. The dog sat by the food until it starved to death. The dog loved its owner very much.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;poor doggo :( i du lik dese jokes tho so i got tha book tuk me ages 2 find it but its grate so funny!

&gt;i lik the 1s with no animals tho

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I think it gets funnier the more you read. You get past a barrier, remind yourself that no one is actually being hurt, and that sort of lets you laugh at it. Does that make sense?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;You’ve got that backwards. Your “barrier” is stopping you from actually enjoying yourself. The real fun comes after you don’t need the book any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;What do you mean?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;rofl @ no. 582!! a child is asked 2 go 2 bed. they ask 4 mor time up. their parents rip ther skin away!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;That’s really weird. I’ve just read #0852. It’s like a twisted mirror of that joke. *A child stands at the foot of their parents’ bed. The child bleeds. Their skin has been torn away. The parents weep. “Please don’t come to bed,” they cry. The child only smiles. They will always come to bed.*

&gt;Is there come kind of narrative to this book?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What if WE ARE THE NARRATIVE?! MIND = BLOWN!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Not a great medium for a narrative. Most people don’t read the jokes in order. Unless I guess it’s going for a whole “every experience is unique” deal. I don’t really get that vibe from it. I think you’re meant to just dip in and out of it when you want to. It’s more addictive that way, y’know?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;well im lovin it sooooo funny lol! gets bettr the mor u read

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I definitely agree with that. Although, I read the very last joke today. Have any of you guys looked at that one? Not what I expected. It’s a bit… weird.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;lol 2 dark 4 u? get off the forum u f@g

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Nah, like I said above, I don’t read joke books cover to cover. I think I flicked past it once, but it seemed pretty long, and it looked like it repeated itself a lot. Was it good weird or bad weird?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I’m not sure. I’ve read through it a few times now. It’s just a really odd one. I’ll try to copy it out (I’ll skip the middle bit, you’ll see why), but I guess you just have to read your own copy to get the full effect.

&gt;*#1000 – Once upon a time, there was a book of jokes. People read the book. They read jokes about death and rape and suffering, and they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed*

&gt;[It goes on like this for a few pages. I’ll skip to the final bit].

&gt;*The people laughed for a long, long time. They laughed until it hurt. Then they stopped laughing. The jokes in the book weren’t enough. They needed more than the book. They needed new jokes. They needed real jokes. They made their own jokes. And then they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed.*

&gt;I guess it’s a bit funny? In a sort of anti-humour kind of way?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I guess so

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;it kinda creeped me out @ 1st but i read it in the book an its pretty funny. like i get it more on the page if tha makes sence

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;i keep goin bak an readin it an actuly its porbably my favorite now. i read it before bed evry nite

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Definitely! I feel exactly the same! I don’t read any of the other jokes any more. Last one is by far the best. Really grows on you.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;Haha, record it! I want to watch that!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What’s wrong? I just want you to laugh. And laugh and laugh and laugh.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[Thread locked]

&amp;nbsp;

And that’s it. That’s the full thread. As far as I can tell, it’s the only one on the site, or anywhere else for that matter, that mentions ‘1000 Dark Jokes’. No, I don’t know what the deleted posts were, they were removed long before I got there. I can imagine, but I’d rather believe they weren’t what I think they probably were. In any case, of the users above, FG and StabbyPete don’t seem to have posted anywhere else after this. I’m pretty sure they were both banned. So was JewsInTheOven, but he kept posting after this. Nothing about the book, just troll drivel. DontTellMom stuck around for a long time, last active a few months ago, but didn’t reply to any private messages I sent. Neither did any of the others. It’s an old thread, they probably don’t use the forum anymore.

In any case, this is literally everything I know about ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make your Soul Rot’. Please, *please* tell me one of you knows about this book. I *need* to read it!

Edit: So since posting this, the original thread has been deleted. Not sure if that’s a coincidence, but seems pretty odd timing.

Edit2: You’re not going to believe this! The book is real! Someone sent me a copy! Don’t know who, but *thank you!!!* Been reading through a few of them, it’s exactly as described above. Weird, but it’s great knowing it really exists! Must have already read through a hundred or so, it really does get funnier the further in you get! Once I’m finished I’ll share my favourites!

Edit3: Nearly done, now!

Edit4: They weren’t kidding about that last joke. It goes on over seven pages. Very funny though. Maybe the best one.

Edit5: It repeats “and laughed” exactly one thousand times. I counted.

Edit6: Does anyone want to see a video of my baby sister?

I had this dream last night where I Asked a person if they wanted to go to PAX with me because I was going later on in the day and they rejected me as if I asked them out. Wot? Why does my brain do this to me? I don’t even know the person irl and have never seen them before. It was so awkward...

The "Hair on" mark blade So got my buddy into WoT by listening to the Audio books.  He got all the way to ToM and asked me why a hair on a sword marked a blade master.  It took me awhile to understand his confusion and set him straight.

Could a bad VANOS solenoid cause a misfire? I bought my N52 E90 about 6 months ago with 95k kilometers on the clock. Five days after I got it, it started misfiring at WOT and in between gear shifts (automatic), it misfired badly enough once that it caused a CEL. Took it back to the dealer and he replaced a coilpack and called it good. It was still idling slightly rough and making a small knocking sound etc so I took it to my indy bmw mechanic and he said yep it's knocking. Took it to the dealer (he is is own on-site mechanic, conflict of interest? Ha) but he said it was fine. I took it to BMW dealer and they also said it was fine, so I've been driving it for about 10k kilometer now and the CEL came on again, I scanned it and it's a code for the exhaust VANOS solenoid. Since it went into the failsafe mode with the CEL on it hasn't made the knocking sound once!

Should I go back and demand him to replace it for me as I'm 99% sure that's been the issue all along, and it just hasn't been bad enough to pop a code until now?

Gonna discuss this with my indy bmw mechanic on Monday.

Cheers for any input guys!

0-60 mph time for Mk7.5 - normal to be above 7.0s without LC? I've been doing some 0-60 runs in my Mk7.5 recently and I'm getting around an average time of 7.2s. I'm measuring this time with a stopwatch and my eyes, which obviously isn't very accurate, but it's hard to imagine I can be that far off.

The car is DSG, is in sport mode, and ASR is off. No launch control. I'm giving it as much throttle as I feel I can without excessive wheel-spin and wheel-hop in 1st gear, which means I'm not going WOT until 2nd.

The official time is 6.5s for this car, so I feel it should be easy to get under 7.0s without LC, especially with better tires than stock.

What do you guys think? Am I babying the car? Are you supposed to just pedal to the metal and let the wheels spin or what?

As an aside, I've driven the car for a total of 5000km now, but at about 4000km I noticed an audible increase in loudness of the 'air rushing' sound that comes on at approx 2000-3000 rpm. It wasn't big increase in loudness, but definitely enough to notice the sound signature had changed. I've never owned a turbo car before, so I promised myself I wouldn't worry about any 'funny noises' when the boost comes on, but now I'm not so sure. Small boost leak?

Maybe I'm used to the power now (MOAR POWAH syndrome) but the car just feels a bit slow now.

Tooth and Antler *Third Day of the Twelfth Moon, 407*

Ekkill made his way slowly among the group of Icetooths to the Antler Clan camp: they'd abandoned their village after the floods, but established themselves firmly upon the Barkbiter border. *Small achievement, to trample a bug in the mud.* The Antler Clan was far from the strongest even in the Haunted Forest, but it was formidable enough to defend itself. They rode upon short reindeer, perhaps the basis of their name, at the least in part alongside their position near the river. Antler Clan warriors wore large, full iron helms, and mounted the shortened antlers of their mounts upon their helmets after they died.

Other clans, including the Crowkillers, rode harts, though they weren't as effective and often proved rowdier. Domestication proved to be one of the most useful techniques free folk learned in the south, and wargs benefitted particularly from the knowledge.

"Once the Antler clansmen are ready to move, we can finally slaughter those boastful Barkbiters!" Floki was clearly excited by everything that had happened, ecstatic that he finally had the stones to attack a few starving women and children.

"You'll do no such thing, not unless their new chieftain scoffs at the peace I offer. I've no need of more blood in the snow when I can have spears lining my ranks." Ekkill spoke with a slight growl in his voice. Floki dared not go against Ekkill's word, not since he held an axe at the throat of the chieftain only half a man and half a pathetic boy. Floki grumbled, but did not object. Ekkill knew his army would face difficulties, but it mattered little, as long as they kept their composure until they'd taken the north. Still, they had a long way to go.

They met the chieftain of the Antler Clan, Cobb, at the peak of a small hill, in a clearing surrounded by snowy forest. Cobb was an old, scarred man, tall and lanky with piercing blue eyes and a short but bushy beard, white as snow. He appeared yet taller atop his mount, a particularly furry reindeer with long, twisting antlers. He wore a leather coat, probably looted from a crow, with small plates of metal sewn to the ragged surface. A reindeer skull sat atop his steel helm, several sharp antlers protruding from each side.

"Oi! Wot took ye so damn long? Kromm's gone and got stuck, eh? Ne'er liked th' sod, though I didn't expect a boy to fell 'im, that ol' bear." he waved dismissively at Floki. "So, out with it, Crowsbane: wot say ye o' the alliance? Don't s'pose that Kroll whelp'll lay low 'is axe now Kromm's dead." Ekkill shrugged.

"We delivered Kromm's body, a gesture of good will. It ain't too late for you lot to make peace, but it's up to Kroll to choose whether to spare his own people of slaughter." Ekkill looked to the riders beside Cobb.

"I'd like your men to accompany my own to the Barkbiter camp. If you are to join my cause, you ought to show that your people stand alongside their allies."

Englands litter problem. Rubbish. Fucking everywhere.

Its kind of pissing me off. When i say that as an englishman. I mean. Its pissing me off. No 'kind of' involved.

Recently i was lucky enough to go to Tokyo, Japan on holiday (always wanted to go and saved for a while).

One of the most densely populated cities on the planet and it was spotless.

Fucking spotless. Yet, not a bin in sight.

I was walking at a local nature reserve reservoir today and some cunt (probably a night fisherman) has just thrown food packaging, tetra pack, general shit into the lake thing. Meanwhile a goose with its ten chicks are waddling by and i just think, what a fucking bellend.

I honestly feel the general english have a sense of 'ahh well, someone else will deal with it' attitude.

I blame our over timid attitude, our affraid to enter into potential conflict incase we offend somebody bullshit.
I know i am because i can gaurantee what the response would be to; ' you dropped your rubbish, can you put it in the bin?'
'yA wOt DiCk ED?! Ya WaNT glASSIN??'

I therefor am calling upon all individuals to point out and shame those that cannot be fucking arsed to deal with there own rubbish.
If you see someone dropping litter or allowing there wanky little dog to shit all over the pavement, i want you to be verbal, call them out and to be assertive that the bloody country would be alot better if people like those didnt thrown there shit everywhere.

Japan was weird. But fuck was it quiet, clean and peaceful.

Car misfires, but misfires clear when flooring it. Recently my car has been in the shop for a burnt exhaust valve on cylinder 2.

It's a 2005 Mazda 6 Sportbreak 1.8 (Duratec 1.8L engine)

The car sat for a month before getting the valve replaced.

I got the car back yesterday, but it's still acting up. Just after I got it it drove perfectly fine, but near the evening it started hesitating again. If you were to accelerate, it would buckle, chuck and hesitate to accelerate. Flooring the throttle clears it and the car accelerates normally again afterwards.

After driving ~200km/120 miles the CEL went on upon trying to go fast and the car refused to go faster than 160kmh/100mph (German autobahn), misfire cylinder 1 it's saying. I feel like which cylinder is misfiring is a bit random. When the exhaust valve on cylinder 2 went bad and caused 0 compression, it was still complaining that cylinder 4 was misfiring even though cylinder 2 wasn't firing at all.

The plugs are new, the spark plug wires are new, and cylinder 2 has a new exhaust valve.

It only misfires upon slow acceleration and in the lower rev range. Upon revving it past 4k rpm it doesn't misfire, but accelerates smoothly. It's just, for example when taking off from a light it will sometimes buckle and refuse to accelerate, forcing me to go WOT for a second so it will accelerate normally again.

Another hint to problems may be that it starts harder when it's warm. The engine will light off but buckle and sputter for a little bit before revving up to idle. It has always done this though. It misfires both hot and cold.

Can anybody help me where I should start looking for the issue?

1/8 Throttle bog and exhaust pops. Vacuum leak? Motorcycle, Triumph TT600, 2003, 4 cylinder, 600cc, fuel injection, ITBs, everything stock.
There is a very bad throttle response on low throttle openings. The problem has been present for years and two shops didn't find anything.


Symptoms are:

* Idle is very low when cold 20 sec after starting. But fine after 2 min and when hot.
* When moving, opening the throttle from idle to 1/8 there is no response. Nothing at all. Past 1/8 opening engin suddenly pickup and I have to back the throttle a bit if I want cruising.
* When moving, fast throttle openings from idle to anywhere past 1/4 seems not affected.
* When moving, going WOT and then cutting to 1/8 feels like not throttle. After 1-2 sec at 1/8 exhaust will pop. Quite when cold to loud bang when hot. The longer at WOT, the louder the bang when back to 1/8.
* Doing the same thing but going back to idle, and staing there, will not cause pops and bangs.
* When moving, going from 1/2 to 1/8 will not pop as much as WOT, but will make a flame and kind of a woosh sound.
* From 1/4 to WOT there is no problem. Bike run fine and power is there with no bogs.


Bike stood still for four years. Now the problem seems to have worsen while nothing has been done on the bike.
I've cleaned the throttle bodies and butterflies, the airbox, adjusted the throttle cables to 2mm play and generally checked everything that came to my mind.

Worth noting that at one point, years ago, a (professional) mechanic did put at least 1 liter too much oil in it. That shoots lods of oil in the airbox and blow an oil gasket. Ultimately leading to a valves and valve seats job. But throttle problem was there before that.

It seems to me that the insulators between the airbox and the throttle bodies are quite dry and don't make good contact. The MAP sensor is in the airbox, after the filter, and line seems clean. Can this vacuum leak cause that problem?

Any other ideas?

That sadsly be's the point. Oh Gork, Oh Mork... you gave us a new ideas in 'ow to fight so many months ago, but you doesn't give us the tools. The WAAAAAAAGH is strong, but there's no sign of proppa oomph in it. The boyz can barely cut the face offa a twiggy 'ikkle flimsy 'umie, and the poncey pointy 'eads are dancier'n'evah. How can we get to lootin'? Or fighting, or killin' or winnin' when we's ain't had the proper tool to snap together a proppa slugga, let alone a right killy choppa.

None's had a proppa thump in the skull from the likes of youze since ol Thrakka slapped his mob down onta Armageddon.  The Mek Boyz seem to have right run outta ideas for their gadgets and smarty gubbinz, and the boyz are startin' to gamble more than fight.

Brand new genuine Omron switches starts double-clicking after a week - what am I doing wrong? So, long story (kinda) short. First I had a Deathadder with a double-clicking issue so I got some new Omron D2FC-F-7N switches from Ebay and changed both left and right switch. I'm fairly good at soldering and didn't use excessive heat. Worked absolutely fine for a week and then started double-clicking again. Was tired of it and got a new Steelseries Rival 300.

A year later this mouse too started double-clicking on single click. Thinking I may have received fake switches the first time, I ordered some Omron D2F-01F from Mouser. So guaranteed genuine. Soldered them on and again, working fine on this mouse too ... for about a week. Changed it again, held up for six days. Digged in my drawers and got the old Deathadder and put these new switches in it. You guessed it, worked absolutely fine but after **two whole weeks** this time (without a single hiccup), it also started double-clicking again.

If there was a problem with my soldering I would think the problem would manifest itself sooner. But I must be doing something wrong. I've double checked positioning thinking I'm placing the switches skewed or not seated properly but that doesn't seem to be the case. I've double and triple checked that every pin makes perfect contact with a multimeter.

These switches are rated for 1m clicks, they can't wear out in a week. Are they extremely sensitive to heat or something? I'm tempted to just smash both mice with a sledgehammer right now but at the same time I refuse to give up. If anyone has had similar problem or any idea why this could be happening it's greatly appreciated. Sorry for the WoT.

Intermittent power loss with throttle after sitting on hot days; '06 Ninja 250. *Wall of text* ***Long post. Apologies; I know details and circumstance are important to nuanced shit like carbureted engines and old bikes***

Hey gang,

I finally made a dream come true and joined the club. Bought a salvaged '06 Ninja 250 from craigslist. Dude had a shop in a small town, but he posted a walk around video online and had go pro footage of him taking it up to 90 a couple times, so I figured it was sound. And other than scratched up fairings and a front fender that *almost* matches after a previous respray, it is.

Hauled it home and I've been loving it. After the first weekend, realized the battery was reeeeaaaalllly low so I swapped it for a fresh one and haven't had any issues or related symptoms. Drove it to my brother's place during the weekend and cleaned and lubed the chain because it was gross, washed it, managed to realize that tire shine was a terrible idea before I used it, and drove it home. Performed very well.

For the second week I used the bike to commute to work and back, the weather was peaking at about 80F during the day, and after being parked in an open parking lot it was doing fine. That Friday (last Friday), the weather approached 90F during the day. As I left the shop at about 5:30 (bike ran fine at lunch, has been sitting in the sun for about 5 hours), I did my usual start (no choke needed) and let it warm up for about 30 seconds as I put on my gloves. I let out the clutch in first with the RPMs at about 3k (mellow takeoff in a ninja) and it starts to bog down and stall. I engage the clutch and it idles fine. Repeat a few times, and decide to give the engine a couple minutes to warm up or adjust it's fuckin' attitude or whatever, you know how older vehicles get, and it takes off fine. Ride a half mile to a light, turn right onto the highway, and it's great at about 60mph for the next 20 minutes.

Get onto a secondary road, performs fine. Right at a stop sign, goose it a bit to get it up to 50, keep the RPMs at about 8k through some twists, settle down into 6th to cruise at about 6k, and it's doing fine. Try to give it a bit of throttle about 30 seconds later, and the engine starts to bog down.
Let off the gas, and roll on again. Bogs and RPMs drop. I'm starting to slow now, so I downshift and engine brake to avoid stalling it at speed. Get down to first and stop with the clutch in. Give it about 30 seconds to adjust it's attitude again, and I'm fine the whole way home. *Keep in mind, at my house I have it parked in a spot that is usually shady, and it's usually under a cover*

Over the weekend, I changed the oil and filter. The old oil was pretty thin and had some gasoline in it, but was clean of gunk and debris. Used good proper stuff, the correct filter, and it actually went really smoothly. Hell, I even got smart and emptied the airbox overflow hose and got the expected couple of drops. Repaired a couple small things with my fairings, and was really stoked to ride. I rode around for about 15 minutes, and after the first 10 I was really goosin' it. Got it up to 90 on a good straight without much effort, and everything sounded and felt great.

A couple hours later, close to dusk, went out and rode it for about an hour. Wasn't riding it very hard, just enjoying my first ride-to-ride type ride since I've become comfortable enough to enjoy riding rather than being terrified and taking turns like a grandma. Gave it close to WOT a few times because it's a 250 and that's what happens, but I didn't have any issues whatsoever. Very pleased with this whole motorcycling thing at this point, and the "annoying" maintenance you've got to be attentive to as opposed to driving a car is actually pretty fuckin' easy to access and has a lot lower torque values so I'm not stripping bolts and tearing shit up.

Today, Monday, I rode it to work again. It's fuckin' hot, but in the mornings it's about 75 and it started up great, no choke, rode it about 30 seconds later and it was  great the whole 30 minutes to work. Even in stop and go traffic, it has a steady idle and no issues at all. Park it and go in for a few hours. Ask a good ol' boy about Friday and he mentions vapor locking on carbureted bikes and tells me to open the gas tank to relieve pressure and I'll be fine.

Lunch time, about noon, it's hot as a motherfucker. I'd say mid-90s but I wasn't paying attention. Open the gas tank for a few seconds, then lock it back again. Let it idle while I put my gloves on, and it takes off with no issues. Get to the end of the parking lot and it's doing that...THING again. I'm just going about 500 yards up the street, so I wait about 20 seconds, and try again. Takes off fine. Shift into second and it's fine, get it up to 30mph in 3rd at mid-range RPMs, about 7/8k. As I'm cruising, I let off the throttle to start slowing down. Give it a little more as the ending braking in 3rd is pretty strong and I'm slowing sooner than I'd like to, and it bogs down. I'm in the middle lane approaching a left turn, and as I slow I downshift into second. It grips hard, and slows me a bit more. I start my left turn into a parking lot-type area, and I can't get any power out of it. I'm going about 5 mph at this point, so I downshift into first and I'm pumping the throttle, but it dies a few feet away from the parking lot in the street. I freak the fuck out, hop off and push this piece of shit off the road. Try to start it and it won't go. Start it while giving throttle and it won't turn over. Open the choke about 1/3rd way, it starts right up, no problems with the revs or anything, and it drives fine up to 25 mph until I park. Go in for a bit, starts up fine about 30 minutes later, drives fine back to work.

After work, I try the gas tank thing again. Starts up fine this time and pulls off fine. Get onto the highway like last Friday, and get about 20 minutes of flawless 60mph+ riding. Get onto the secondary roads, and I have about  10 minutes of great riding from about 35-50 mph. Slowed to go over some railroad tracks, and at about 30 mph and climbing I had the same issue again. I managed to slow it down without killing it, got into the parking lot of an elementary school, and after waiting about 30 seconds at idle, I did a series of 1st&gt;2nd runs and it seemed fine. Did a couple more up the third, kinda granny shifting though, and had no issues.

Took it back onto the road, and it's doing great. Ride for a mile or so and have to stop at a stop sign. Wait it out, have a long straight ahead of me, so I get on it early. Speed shifting pretty good, get it up to about 75 before the wind noise is annoying and I'm certain my bike is doing fine, so I settle into cruising about 60 (these are 55 mph zones before the hate brigade comes around). As I approach my first turn, I downshift into 5th to get it at about 7.5kRPMs, and as I open the throttle, it starts to bog down. Now I'm real pissed, and the engine braking at 8k rpm is kinda heavy, so I start to slow down real quick. I'm not sure exactly when, but I think as I engaged the clutch to shift into 4th, it died on me. The engine is braking a good bit now, so I engage the clutch and ride it out. Get it off the road and into the grass, and chill for a minute. Start it with a bit of choke, and let it sit for a minute. During my takeoff, I learned that grass is real slick, even in the dry, which was fun. I stabilized it in first and then immediately learned that getting onto the road from a lowered shoulder is bumpier than I thought. Bike is doing fine though; worked up through the gears a bit gently the last 5 minutes of my trip and didn't encounter any problems.

And here I am now. I'm considering taking it out in a couple hours to see if it performs better when it hasn't been in the sun for a few hours, which has been the case so far. I'd consider it being carb junk except that it didn't happen in the first 350 miles of riding, even in some spirited conditions, and after 2 tanks of gas. I haven't used reserve either, so it's not like I've gotten anything from the very bottom of the tank, and I'm not leaning ANYWHERE near enough to stir it up that much. I don't think I fucked anything up during the oil change, since the symptoms were there before and haven't changed. The only thing I can pick out that leads to these issues is sitting in the sun for multiple hours and getting *pretty* damn hot.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. Any ideas?


TL;DR - When my bike sits for a few hours in the sun and hot air, it acts like a bitch and bogs down when I go over 4k RPMs at start up, and sometimes after riding for a bit.

Car didn't want to go into 4th gear WOT redline quick-shifting Got a weird one for y'all:

Last night I attempted a WOT redline shift (regular fast shifting not power-shifting, throttle was lifted) from 3-4 and the car didn't go into gear. Shifter went into the gate for 4th but I floored it again instantly hit redline and the car went nowhere. Slowed down, took it out of gear and re-selected 4th, and everything worked as it should.

So 4th gear is fine but for some reason did not engage when I tried WOT quick shifting at redline. Any other driving condition is fine (drove it to work today no problem), and if I granny shift it at redline it will go into 4th no problem.

Just rowing through the gears with the car off, 4th feels no different than any other gear.

The car is a 2009 bmw 335i with 110k miles making about 690 whp. Aftermarket upgraded clutch was put in with all the usual clutch job items (pivot pin, throwout bearing, etc) about 17k miles ago, and the MTF is fresh.

Where should I even start to look? Thanks

Ford Escape Torque Converter Issue? I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/8gyuut/2015_ford_escape_20l_low_power_turbo_issue/) previously about my issue. Since then, I've purchased an OBD2 to verify my turbocharger is building adequate pressure (Seems to be -- ~16psi at WOT)

Somebody else has suggested I test the torque converter by driving along at a steady speed with foot on gas and then tapping the brake. They said my RPM should jump a couple hundred if the torque converter is working.  I tried it at many different speeds and brake pressures. Never once did the RPM jump in response.

Based on that, does this sound like a torque converter issue to you? If so, and I am able to get it replaced, do I need to worry about it also being a transmission issue or something on top of the torque converter?

Life's going back to normal, but what is normal. [CW: Mention of Suicide] Hello everyone, back when I started transitioning I was in a seemingly safe job as the lead translator of an SME. I lost that job due to transition (or bigotry) and mobbing. So after 4.5 years as a translator with a seemingly safe career I fell into a deep depression, I contemplated suicide so often, I've stopped keeping track. For about 6 months, I was nothing but an empty shell. I had a smooth transition with regards to therapy and name change and even my surgery was approved quickly. But that wasn't enough to keep me going. About a year ago, I decided to take on nursing school and become an nurse, so I started my apprenticeship in September of last year. Let's say it has been bumpy. I've had two breakdowns at work because of a mix of progesterone induced bouts of depression, general depression, a new working environment, a system that is overloaded and forced me to do a lot of the stuff that I wasn't yet comfortable doing because we were (at times heavily) understaffed, colleagues that don't tell me their honest opinions and patients who quickly let me know what it's like to be a woman in this world. It doesn't help that, from a bearded 23-yo, I apparently turned into a 17-looking woman. Nobody takes me seriously and people have repeatedly questioned my state of mind, just because I dare to have and even voice an opinion. I have been gaslighted at my new job and when I was eventually forced to either come out to management or lose my job, I could keep it but, even though I'm employed with a mental health provider, I was met with all the usual stuff that people say and assume who haven't got the first idea.

Anyways, I wonder if this will get better. Coming from a desk job, it took me a couple of months to adjust and also become more stable myself. I had to relearn that everybody doesn't want to throw you under the bus - unless they do. It is so much to take in right now, getting used to this new life and social experience, not knowing what is expected of me as a woman at times, and having to master all the mysoginy out there everyday. I don't want to complain as much as I wonder how others cope with all this. It seems like everything's coming down on me at once and I'm out of ideas how to cope with it, especially since therapy isn't an option right now because I seem to be unable to find a therapist who doesn't see the solution in 'treating this identity disorder'...

I'm thankful for any input and sorry for the wot.

When D&amp;D makes you cry. &gt;One  of the points everyone in my playing group agrees on, is that the best  sessions must involve a massive laughing fit. You know, the kind that  after a while makes your sides hurt and eyes water, while still laughing  uncontrollably.
&gt;
&gt;Sadly,  it doesn't happen every session, but there is one that never fails to  make me smile \-sometimes even snort\- when recalling the scene. This was  AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, so no need to say how long ago, right?
&gt;
&gt;Cue: The Siege of the Emerald Tower.
&gt;
&gt;The campaign had evolved around chasing a renegade and quite powerful warlock for almost two \(game time\) years.
&gt;
&gt;This particular warlock had the best luck I've seen an NPC have. Heck, he wasn't even created as a notable NPC: he *became* one.
&gt;
&gt;Thing  is, every time he had been cornered, he always managed to escape at the  very last moment by sheer/dumb luck rolling natural 20's along with the  party rolling critical misses at the worst times \(for them\). In their  last encounter, the warlock had escaped \-with one HP\- after rolling a  99&amp;#37; followed by a 100&amp;#37; on d100. In. Two. Consecutive. Rolls.
&gt;
&gt;Of  course after his second miraculous escape, he attained a name: Wakko  the Warlock. Yes, we drink while gaming, and making up names on the go  is not one of my strengths. So Wakko it was.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway,  after his fourth \(or fifth?\) escape, the party really, really wanted to  absolutely murder this dude, some players even blaming him for jinxing  their rolls/luck.
&gt;
&gt;Now, up to Wakko's Last Miraculous EscapeTM  , we had been drinking and playing for about six hours straight. We  were all "a bit" drunk quite tired, so after a near TPK I suggested we  should pickup on the next session. The players \(even the ones whose  characters had died\) of course would have none of that: Wakko had  escaped, yes, BUT WITH ONLY ONE EFFIN' HIT POINT. There was no way in  Bourbonland this wouldn't end tonight. Oh well.
&gt;
&gt;Enter final boss scene.

*holdmybeer.jpg*

&gt;The  Warlock is secluded inside a square magical emerald tower. Of course,  as it "sometimes" happens when the DM is coerced into keeping on play at  3 AM, each of the towers' corner was being promptly guarded by a major  demon.
&gt;
&gt;Who  formed the party, you might ask? After the near TPK, only Saddabush the  Master Thief, and Golic the\-most\-stereotypical\-fighter\-the  world\-has\-ever\-seen remained; both kind of in a bad shape, fresh out of  healing potions and clearly outclassed by the demons, let alone Wakko.
&gt;
&gt;It  is worth noting Sadabush's player was the kind of player that rolled  five or six "practice" rolls before his "good" roll. While trying all of  the d20's on the table to find "the one that wasn't jinxed", the  following dialogue takes place:
&gt;
&gt;Golic: "I don't care. Wakko dies tonight."
&gt;
&gt;Saddabush: "Um, you do realize there are four major demons guarding the Tower, yes?"
&gt;
&gt;Golic \-after \(literally\) taking a swig\- replied: "I don't care. Wakko dies tonight, along with his demons. And you will help me"
&gt;
&gt;Saddabush: "We are gonna die."
&gt;
&gt;Golic: "So we will die trying. Wakko dies tonight too."
&gt;
&gt;Saddabush: "But what's the point?"
&gt;
&gt;And so on....
&gt;
&gt;While  Golic and Saddabush kept on arguing \(and drinking\), me and the other  players started scraping bits of chips from empty bowls, picking up cans  and checking empty bottles, one even crashed the couch while we were  all making small talk. "Nice" I thought, "this session might actually  end in less than five min..."
&gt;
&gt;"THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO!" a quite drunk Golic blurted out, Saddabush grinning with glazed eyes.
&gt;
&gt;I blinked.

*saywhat.jpeg*

&gt;Everybody turned to him. Even the guy on the couch sat up.
&gt;
&gt;"I will put on Saddabush's Boots of Speed!"
&gt;
&gt;"I see..."
&gt;
&gt;"And I will sit on Golic's shouldersss while wielding his Vorpal longssshword"
&gt;
&gt;"Okaaaaaay... and?"
&gt;
&gt;The rest of the players started giggling.
&gt;
&gt;"And I'm gonna wear the cape of illusion on top of us to turn ourselves into a beholder"
&gt;
&gt;"Say what?"
&gt;
&gt;Giggling turned to laughter.
&gt;
&gt;"I will run full speed around the tower while Saddabush decapitates the demons"
&gt;
&gt;"Wait, you can't..."
&gt;
&gt;"Yes, yes we will, just watch, and remember: as a gryphon!"
&gt;
&gt;"...beholder"
&gt;
&gt;More laughter.
&gt;
&gt;"You know what I mean".
&gt;
&gt;*Golic throws a d20*

    strength check: 15

&gt;So they are now running at supernatural speed straight into the first demon.
&gt;
&gt;"Dude, the illusion, you forgot to activate it!"
&gt;
&gt;General laughing fits begin.
&gt;
&gt;"Oh shit! I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC!"
&gt;
&gt;As if that would help, but by then I just wanted to see what would happen next. *Threepracticerollslater.png*

    wild magic cape of illusion check: 1.

&gt;Couldn't/wouldn't  let this one slide by. So they are now running at supernatural speed  straight into the first demon. As a midget purple striped giraffe. Full blown  laughter erupts.
&gt;
&gt;Between  gasps for air I let them know their rolls will be penalized in order  for them to kill the demons in that fashion. The rest of the party just  wants to see this most spectacular suicide.
&gt;
&gt;Demon #1. *four\_or\_six\_practice\_rolls\_later.jpg*

    17

&gt;The  sword is \+3, so there goes one demonic head flying. Cheering, clapping  and laughter ensued. Golic makes a tight turn, full speed ahead to...
&gt;
&gt;Demon #2. *a mere two practice rolls.gif*

    18

&gt;MFW
&gt;
&gt;"Wot!?" By now the cheering was seamlessly mixed with laughter.
&gt;
&gt;Golic picked up pace towards Demon 3 who was already painfully aware of the homicidal midget purple striped giraffe.
&gt;
&gt;"Ok, remember this roll will be penalized by a minus..."
&gt;
&gt;Before I could finish the sentence and without "practice" roll,

    Fucking nat 20

&gt;I'm  positive my neighbors must have thought we had just won the world  championship of... weirdos playing a satanic tabletop summoning game or  something.
&gt;
&gt;"SEE??? I told you there's no need for those stupid practice rolls"
&gt;
&gt;"I know, right?! Go, go, go!"
&gt;
&gt;Warp drive engaged towards Demon #4
&gt;
&gt;"Imma cut you up bitch!"

*OMGNoPracticeRoll.png*

    rolls a 1

*multiplayerfacepalm.gif*

&gt;The  astonishment came accompanied by deafening silence. The neighbors must  have been delighted. This demon would most likely kill them both.*farawaysoclose.mov*
&gt;
&gt;That is, untill Sadabush attempted intimidating the last demon.
&gt;
&gt;"Run shuu cowardsssh, run from the mighty shiraffe from sheelestial hell!"
&gt;
&gt;He rolls a 20 on the practice roll. Feels ***empowered***.
&gt;
&gt;"Heeeere it goooeshhh...!"

    Fucking nat 1

&gt;We  all lost it. Again. I couldn't stop laughing for at least 30 minutes  straight. Like everyone else in the room. By the time the hysteria  subdued, we weren't even able to finish the adventure. Good times.
&gt;
&gt;And that was the time when playing D&amp;D made the whole party \(and me\) cry.
&gt;
&gt;I apologize for the "you had to be there" type of story, but I thought it was worth sharing here.

Let me explain why I'm pretty excited about being the weird non-instragramworthy guy in a prius soon! Serious WoT Warning I've only ever lived in my lowtop E150 van since I've been doing this (converted from a casual sleeper to a camper) but I always have been into minimizing as much as possible and going into the van was definitely part of that. Ultralight travel is something that interests me a whole lot. My van is nearly empty and almost everything I use day to day fits well in a nice backpack apart from my bed and actual walls, chair, heaters &amp; fan. This isn't how it always was. My van used to be stuffed with a ton of dumb stuff I bought thinking I'd use ( and trust me I know... what a rookie mistake, the folks on here telling you to watch out for this are dead serious, buy as you go, not before you go).

So why a prius? I really want to be free to be where I want to be no matter what season it is, even in the muggy east coast if I so choose. The hybrid climate control seems like a great solution for not being leashed to an rv park or facing the expense of running a big generator. Your only option is to run with the weather, which is also pretty costly depending, that's not an issue in this car. The prius also has solar option that will run the fan to keep it hospitable inside while the car is off during hot days without burning any gas if it's not a scorcher out. That's a factory option.  Being able to run the heat or a/c (not in an enclosed space) all night for a few bucks of gas on the hybrid seems well worth the tradeoff. From what I've read of it, it can also sleep one person a hair above 6' comfortably on a flat surface.

To be entirely honest I've only ever found myself sleeping in the van. I'm almost always out doing something until it's time to go to bed and that's my style. That's just what I like doing, I don't want to sit in the van all day and I never really have. The prius is also pretty damn lowkey compared my full sized van. I imagine it should open up some opportunities to explore where I wouldn't be able to without being harassed otherwise. My favorite example of this is from a software developer, [Prius Hilton](https://medium.com/@hello.prius.hilton/prius-hilton-4-official-move-in-e45732798892] and his account of waking up next to some [full sized van getting harassed on his first night trying to sleep in the Prius](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xRI9WwWE14Jwj9Xze5lHIg.jpeg) in San Francisco. I haven't been bothered much in the van but it has happened more than I'd like. The truth is I've skeeved enough people and got enough police knocks even with a pretty stealthy setup that I'm kind of growing tired of it. I don't have a record, I'm a good guy and I don't do anything against the law, but this still happens. Don't get me wrong I expect at least some knocks if I go this route, just fewer. I'm sure some ultra all knowing keyboard warrior will tell me I gotta be more low key but, trust me *because I'm a stranger on the internet and I definitely am*.  My favorite experience was probably when I decided to head over to a nice riverfront park for a walk before work (during the day) only to literally be surrounded by not 1 but 3 cruisers with officers asking me questions 5 mins after pulling in. LOL fuck me right.

Keep in mind I'm always close to the civilization so this is probably why I've had some troubles more frequently I'm sure. Getting the knock is going to happen sometimes, that's just life. Really you don't have to be in the middle of a city for access to bathrooms, showers and some healthy food options but being somewhat close to some civilization helps. I definitely had food in my van I never ate (removed), a toilet that was never used (removed), camp stove and cookwear (removed). I even bought a shower bag with one of those pop up shower tents, *never used it*. Of course all of the bigger stuff found a happy home now with other dwellers at the RTR who will actually use that stuff for their style of dwelling. Don't laugh but I even had more water storage than I'd ever use and put that in the free pile as well. Another drawback I've noticed for my style of travel is I like to have downtown access if I'm going to be there for a while for work. I considered renting a monthly garaged spot downtown relatively cheap in at least one city (to be close to work) only to find out my non-hightop van wouldn't even fit in any garage within a 15 mile radius of downtown, not great even for a night of exploring. Probably for the best though because renting is terrible. Parking in that city in particular was atrocious.

I know people think, hell, a Prius? What are you thinking man? You're probably only doing this because you can't take knocks and *I only processed that one thing you typed*. I know how that is. When I was considering vandwelling in the e150 at first the idea of being in a car seemed like something only someone with no other options would ever do. Maybe the most desperate or mentally disturbed people were pushed into it. But isn't that how a lot of people think of people living in their vans? With a little research I found that I was dead wrong and I feel pretty bad for harboring that kind of prejudice for any mobile lifestyle, ever. No one rig is going to be perfect for anyone. There is no one size fits all. Almost everyone I've met since being on the road has switched rigs or adjusted theirs for their needs and rebuilt substantially over the years. That's just how it works. For me the a full size van was and still is overkill I don't need and it doesn't match my needs for where I want to be and where I am. If you think you got into this with the *perfect* setup on your first try 99% chance you're not going to know what's perfect until you're out for a while, anyone who has done this for a while will tell you that.  Of course I'm going to grab a rental for awhile to give it a fair shake before I drop 15k-20k on something low miles and reliable down the road.

Anyways I'm going to post some resources that I found inspiring so other people might find some use in them, or understand why someone might "do this to themselves". [Ruslan Osipov](http://www.rosipov.com/blog/prius-adventures-a-year-later/), a technical lead at Google has a great blog detailing his strategies living out of a Prius. I've seen him post on here in the past and he's been pretty helpful in those few threads, detailing his setup well (very inspired by onebagging and ultralight strategy imo). So far he seems to have the best documented experience in blog format I can find. My favorite setups are probably the most simplistic, [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W86B-6BHrJA) provides a great example of what I want to aim for, but even some of the stuff he's carrying I wouldn't. If you're interested in people that manage this boondocking or whatever, (This video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmT-lmbjfKc] details a much more complicated setup with solar, thule, hauling box etc. [PriusStealthCamper Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/user/timdillen) has pretty much hacked together a small RV into his prius, much more than I'd ever need or want to do, but it exists and that's pretty cool. There is also r/priusdwellers in the sidebar but the community is pretty slow going.

Tomos a35 four stroking (HELP THREAD) Hey relearned a lot of things this week and have formed a better diagnosis I need help with . I have a stock tomos ideling great and over all sounds good , when I ride it starts good but  maxes out at 20 mph and dies on WOT.
If I reduce the throttle too 80-90 percent it starts running again but it fourstrokes then dies at stops.

Spark plug has nice color, what could be causing this? Would a blown seal cause this or am I too rich ? Do I need to reject or is the problem bigger than that? Thanks

[Serious] Is anyone else worried about the increase of hp in cars? Okay before you downvote listen to this. I love fast cars, high horsepower cars and everything performance. I own an e46 and love to drive it but always make sure I'm not doing something dumb. We live in the era of horsepower now with cars coming out from the factory with 400+ horsepower easy and supercars nearing 8-900 horsepower. Even damn dodge's now come with around 900 horsepower. Is it me or is this kinda getting a bit risky? Today, three different cars passed by my street at WOT. It honestly worries me not because of the car but because of the drivers. People think that cars are fast but don't realize how much faster they have gotten. Cars from the factory now can literally beat 10-20 year old full blown racecars. Anyone else share this sentiment?

The Battle Of Rosa Collis, Part 2 Hello there, brave redditors! Today, I return to you with the second part of my For Honor fan fiction. I do hope that you enjoy. If you didn't see the first part, you can find it [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8kapfu/the_battle_of_rosa_collis_part_1_the_approach/). Today, the actions ramping up, as we come across the second 'Hero' of the story, though he *really* doesn't deserve the title, alongside the one person you really can't do a For Honor story without. Without further ado, I present...

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

The Battle Of Rosa Colis

Part 2: The Breach

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Rosa Collis had earned its name. The peacekeeper, exasperated, leaned against the old stone wall of the fortress to pick the thorny stalks from her chainmail. Captain Marius seemed rather uncomfortable, as if a rose had wound its way into a more sensitive area within the inaccessible depths of his great suit of plate, but he stoically attempted to push the sensation from his mind; more for the sake of his pride in the face of the ever\-mouthy assassin than anything else.

She had rather forcefully inserted herself into a mentoring role for the inexperienced commander ever since their first discussion on the topic of leadership, some days ago, and while he loathed her ever\-present mockery, he could hardly say her teachings hadn't borne fruit. Well, that is to say, the Conqueror has decided to start spitting at his feet rather than in his face whenever he passed by, but it was an improvement.

Just about the only person in the whole company who trusted him was the surprisingly spry old woman, and the ever\-cheerful and somewhat sycophantic Warden whom the old peacekeeper had also taken under her wing, who was now marveling at the magnificent architecture of the imposing castle before them. Twirling her dagger around one finger, the peacekeeper sighs.

"This is a terrible idea."

*"This is what you are best at, sister."*

"Why do you simply ASSUME that *'what I am best at'* is infiltrating Chosen fortresses in broad daylight?"

"This daylight is hardly broad, milady. There are many clouds, after all."

*"Well, what ARE you best at, then? Mouthing off to your superiors?"*

"Infiltrating Legion fortresses in the dead of the night, obviously. And the aforementioned, of course."

"I believe in you, Milady!"

"That counts for something, I suppose. You two should head back to the camp, see if our twitchy friend's search for *'sneaky mud\-walker escape tunnels'* has borne any fruit. I'll be up the wall soon, not to worry."

Winding a length of silk rope\- strong and light, a staple of the average Peacekeeper's kit\- around a small but effective grappling hook, the Peacekeeper shakes her head.

"I'm getting too old for this."

*"If it helps, imagine sneaking up on Apollyon from behind and slitting her throat."*

"You're right, that does help. Alley\-oop!"

And up it goes. The towers on both corners of this wall have partially collapsed, meaning that the bandits patrolling the complex's interior have no easy access to it for their patrol routes or sentry posts; a perfect point of insertion. Bracing herself with the thin rope, she puts both feet up on the wall without so much as a grunt.

"See you on the other side. Be careful, the both of you."

"Same for yourself, Milady! *Bonne chance!*"

*"Remember. You are to unlock the main gate for our forces and then plant these time bombs in the main armory. They have a long fuse, so you should have plenty of time to vacate the premises once you light them. We charge when they detonate. Hopefully, their defense will die out quickly without arrows. You are not to engage Makoto, nor any of the Blackstone representatives if they've already arrived. Do I make myself clear?"*

"You've already given me one briefing today dear, I hardly need another."

Adjusting her grip on the rope, the Peacekeeper prepares to climb.

"*Deus Vult*, my dears."

And up she goes.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

"Hmm. Not good. I'd hardly call these bandits."

Closing her spyglass, the peacekeeper shakes her head, staring out worriedly over the rose\-choked military complex. They were practicing drills in the gloom, their gleaming, rain\-soaked steel reflected in the cloud\-choked sunlight as they recited katas. Aside from this one, all walls and all towers of the great compound were fully stationed with archers. If it weren't for the damaged wall and the rainy weather stifling the morning light of dawn, she wouldn't dare approach this place alone.

"In for a penny, in for a florin, I suppose. Show me what you've got, Makoto..."

And down from the wall the peacekeeper stealthily descended. Thankfully, the outskirts of the grounds were overgrown with bushes to hide in, and even more thankfully, the bushes in this area weren't even rose bushes. A thick patch of snowbells, as it were. Luckily for her and any other potential intruders within the mire, most Mireite buildings are elevated slightly off the bare earth, leaving an easily accessible crawlspace between the floor of the building and the ground. As she crawled beneath one of the outlying buildings of the castle grounds, she heard the telltale 'chirping' of the *uguisubari*, or 'nightingale floors', specially built planks that form the flooring of most buildings that are expected to serve a function in the defense of the homeland. These planks are hammered in place with special nails that rub against their mount, creating an unavoidable squeaking noise as one walks on them. One of many reasons that the Peacekeeper really, really hates infiltrating Chosen fortresses. The steps were heavy\- heavy enough to set the wood itself creaking alongside the nails. Could it be...?

The peacekeeper crawled along silently, following below the heavy steps to the center of the building. One last, trembling thump, as the great mass above her came to a seat\- there were no chairs among the Chosen, as it were\- and then several seconds of silence. She could see the light of a lamp through the boards, and a great circle of shadow from the bulk of her object of interest, and a similar square of darkness from what seemed like a short table in front of them.

Then, more footsteps. Their footsteps were different from the other's; whoever it is was smaller than the other set of feet, but just as heavy. As they sat across the table from the other, she heard the sound of something hard hitting wood. That explains the extra weight; they were wearing metal armor. The Chosen didn't have metal armor. Then, the first set of feet speaks in japanese with a chuckle, his voice a deep, booming baritone, filled with mirth.

"At last! I am honored to make your acquaintance in person, *Nanban\-dono*. With how excited I was to receive each of your letters, I don't know if I can focus on our united purpose, having you with me in the flesh! Truly, it is a rare treat, to find a like mind sourced from such far waters! Ahaha!"

He noisily slurps something from the table, and, setting it back down, some spills, leaking between the cracks to meet her nose. Saké. The other set of feet speaks. Her voice was quiet and calm, like the grave, and muffled by a metal visor. She knew that voice all too well. She was speaking Japanese now, perfect Japanese, but she could never fail to recognize it, even if she tried. The tenor of her voice had been seared into her, three years ago, like that scar on her back.

*"Yes, indeed, Koga\-san. So few of us refuse to embrace who we are. To accept our nature. But you... you see what you desire, and you seize it for yourself. This fort attests to that. You understand that the only law that matters is that of nature."*

"Of course! The world only gives you what you *take!* Dogs that do nothing but whimper should just die! Together, you and I can show the rest of the world how man is truly meant to live!"

*"...Teach them to be the Wolves they were always meant to be."*

No. She was already here. Apollyon. Makoto called her *Nanban\-dono*, or Madame Foreigner, probably to keep from embarrassing himself trying to pronounce those double L's, but it could be no one else. She was half\-inclined to worm her way out from under this mud\-soaked hut, crawl back up that wall, and try and call off the attack. The blood of good men would spill by today's end if she didn't.

No. Damn it all, she refused to run away again. If the blood of good soldiers didn't spill today, then that only meant even more blood, innocent blood, the blood of civilians, of 'sheep', in that madwoman's eyes, would be shed in the future. Her senseless reign of terror ended today, along with her Chosen ally. Determined, she continued forward along the sodden, bare dirt, towards the main gate of the compound.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

"...I'm worried about milady, Sir."

*"That's only natural. After all, this is a high\-risk operation, and moreover, a solo mission. She has no backup to speak of, should she be found out. That said, you should rest easy, for now. That one can handle herself. You don't get that old in Ashfeld without skill, even more so as a member of the Peacekeepers."*

"Y've sent her t'her final grave, ye have! They'll tie her down with rough hempen bindin's, I tell ye, over a bamboo shoot! It grow, little by little, wormin' its way through 'er back like a hellion's tongue! And when we find her, she'll be all sun\-dried, I tell ye, like a prune, and ran through by the thing! Like a spear, I tell ye!"

*"Silence! You're hardly helping things, you mad old coot! You didn't even find any on those so called 'sneaking tunnels' of yours!"*

"Milady told me that you learn to ignore him, sir."

*"I find that rather hard to believe."*

"Oh, oh, I know! Let me try something!"

She stands up straight, attempting to peer over a nearby pile of bushes.

"Oh dear! A ninja!"

"WOT NOW?! TE *OCCIDAM!!!*"

And away he goes.

*"He better not try and kill my squire again, soldier."*

"Oh, not to worry, I sent him away from camp, sir."

*"...Well, but what if there ARE ninjas out there?"*

"I should think he can handle a few measly ninjas, sir! You said it yourself; don't get that old in Ashfeld without skill!"

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

She could see them through the walls. Koga Makoto, the *Oni\-shiseiji* himself, and his foreign consort, their silhouettes cast by the lamplight onto the thin paper shōji of the guest house.

But, something unexpected. A shadow crawls out from under the building's foundation, cloaked in dark cloth and mud\-splattered scalemail, two glistening blades, one just shorter than the other, in hand as she pounces upon a lone bandit.

"...Nani?"

Leaning in closer from her perch atop the storehouse roof, she uses her naginata to steady herself, as she observes the foreign shadow slip into the bushes, a guard with a dagger in his heart slung over her shoulder, narrowly avoiding a patrol. Some kind of western *jonin*? She sought the bandit lord's head. She cared little for the enigmatic *Nanban\-dono*. But perhaps the knight cloaked in black metal had a hunter of her own?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

In. Left ear to right ear. Done. The peacekeeper withdraws her dagger, allowing the sentry to slump over into an overgrown rose bush, throat slit. She was almost to the gate now, but the station to unlock the gate was located atop the wall, in one of the two towers girding each side of it. Each tower was filled with guards, and she didn't know which one contained the locking mechanism. This could get messy. One more small building, seemingly a barracks of sorts, laid between her and her destination. The whole crawlspace was choked with rose stalks, a great gnarl of old thorns. There was no way she'd be able to go under it like the one Makoto and Apollyon were in. Cutting a small slit in the paper walls, the Peacekeeper looks through, scouting out the interior.

Aw, damn it. Two of the guards were playing *shogi* within, and four more were betting on the results. She couldn't go around; the building was up against the outer wall, and the other side had a clear line of sight with the central tower, virtually guaranteeing that she would be seen by an archer if she tried going around that side. The only way was through. This was gonna be fast and dirty. She had to think care\-

A muted gasp of surprise sounded from inside the barracks. Looking though her cut, it was immediately apparent why. The two *shogi* players now lacked heads, and there was a bloody slash through the wall closest to them. She had to act now, before the rest screamed. Loading her hand crossbow with one hand and flipping her dagger to a throwing stance with the other, she crashed through the thin paper, sending a bolt through one guard's head as she hurled her dagger into the back of the other. From the other side, from the wall with the bloody gouge, came one of the marsh rangers of the Chosen frontier, the Nobushi. Twirling her naginata over her head artfully, she swings in a wide arc, elegantly opening the throat of one of the remaining two. Hurling herself forward, the peacekeeper draws her shortsword and promptly sheaths it once more, now in the last guard's heart instead of its scabbard. Six dead in the span of less than one breath.

"...Hmm. And you are?"

The Nobushi levels her naginata at her, and she responds in kind, assuming a fencing stance with her shortsword. Speaking in well\-trained japanese, the Peacekeeper attempts to defuse the situation.

"No need for this to get violent. In my experience, two women killing the same people is usually the start of a great friendship."

The nobushi barks angrily at her.

"Silence, *nanban*! Leave this place. You intrude upon our territory."

"Because we hunt one of our own. I have no intention of proceeding into your lands any further than I have to. We both want the same thing."

"You know nothing of what I want, *nanban*."

"Oh?"

She pokes one of the still warm bodies with her foot.

"These are your friends, then? You want Makoto. I want Apollyon. Can't have one without the other right now, dear."

"*Nani*? Apo\-... Apol...."

She looks down at the ground, fuming with shame.

"*…Nanban\-dono?*"

"Yes, dear. If they form an alliance, both of our homelands are in dire peril. Let us work together for now, so that we might save innocent lives. That is what you nobushi do, no? Defend those too far from the heartland for the armies to protect?"

The nobushi looks back up, holding the Peacekeeper's gaze. Finally, she lets the razor edge of her polearm drop.

"...Very well. You may call me Shinobu."

"Very good, very good! I'd tell you my name, but you'd still call me *nanban*, especially with that nasty L in there."

"*N\-nani?!* You tell me you're not even going to introduce yourself?"

Shinobu turns around to face away from her.

"I had been told that westerners are rude beyond compare, but this is too much...!"

"Hey, hey, hey, take it easy, *Shinobu\-chan*, focus upon the task at hand, hm?"

*"CH\-CHAN?!"*

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

*"Should the crazy one be back by now?"*

"Um, probably, sir. Maybe there *were* ninjas out there."

**"AS 'E WERE, THERE WAS, LITT'L LADY!"**

And from the bushes came the Conqueror, dragging a very angry Shinobi into the firelight by the flail chain wound around his neck.

***"野郎!!! 死ね!!!"***

As it were, no one around the campfire spoke Japanese.

**"WE DON'T SPEAK MUDWALKER, YE PAJAMA WEARIN' GIT!"**

Unwinding the chain from around his neck, the Conqueror gives his flail a few whirls above his head, building up brain\-splattering kinetic force in it's flanged end. Just as he was about to swing down, Captain Marius grabs him by the arm, stilling the killing down stroke. Putting a foot on the Shinobi's back and putting his weight down, the Lawbringer pins him to the bogy earth.

*"Do you speak English, Chosen? I have some questions for you."*

***"お前最低だな、人間のクズ!!!!!"***

"I think that means no, sir.

*"So it would seem."*

"Lemme knock 'is brains out, damn ye! You'll kill us all, I tell ye!"

*"SHUT UP, DAMN YOU!"*

"Sir, let me try something! Shinobi are spies, right? They steal intelligence? They need to know what's important, so..."

She crouches down, looking down into the angry, yet unquestionably frightened ninja's desperate eyes, and takes off her helmet. Golden hair falling down her face, she smiles earnestly at the Chosen captive.

And then she speaks. In Latin.

*"You know the tongue we write in, yes? The words of the Holy Book?"*

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

"*Kuso.* Jozu should be back by now."

"Jozu? Who's that, my dear?"

"A *chunin*. My apprentice. We are working together on this mission. He was supposed to plant *bakudan* in the enemy armory, and destroy their store of *ya*, but he forgot them back at camp. He should have returned."

"*Bakudan*, hm? Fortunately, I can do you one better."

"Huh?"

"Ashfeldian bombs. These pack some punch, I tell you!"

She stopped suddenly.

"Wait... *Camp?*"

"Yes. We have a camp on the east side of the *Bara no Oka*."

"Well, we have a camp on the WEST side of Rosa Collis!"

***"Nani?!"***

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

*"A camp on the eastern side?! You mean to tell me we're not the only army trying to get into Rosa Collis?!"*

"It seems not, sir! He says they intended to infiltrate the fortress silently and launch an ambush after destroying their supply of arrows!"

*"Th.... THAT’S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO! WE WERE GONNA HAVE THE GATE UNLOCKED BY HER AND EVERYTHING!!!"*

"But he says that's not how they were going to do it, sir!"

***"What?!***

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

"A secret escape tunnel?! That mad fool was right! Well, if you have a way in, then why did you sneak into camp, asides from destroying their arrow stores?"

"I am to light the war banner atop the central tower aflame. That would signal the archers to begin their opening volley."

"W\-wait a minute! That’s\-"

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

*"Lighting the war banner was going to be our signal to fire the catapults! Two armies, besieging the same fortress, with the SAME plan?! To kill two people who hold the same philosophies and have committed the same crimes in their respective homelands?! This is too much!"*

"And yet, it's the truth, sir!"

**"ME 'EAD 'URTS!!!"**

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

"W.....W\-well. Frankly, I'm aghast. Truly, the Chosen and the Iron Legion are more similar than either one of us would like to admit."

"So... it would seem, *nanban*."

"Well... On to our respective duties, then? You should plant the bombs in his stead, we can't afford to wait around in enemy territory. I'll unlock the gate for my people, then we'll light the war banner to signal yours and start the attack. "

"Very well.  Which Legion do you follow?"

"Iron, *Shinobu\-chan*."

"Good. Should Jozu return, I will tell him that the Ashfeldian's in green and yellow standards are allies, and to deliver that message to the rest of our forces."

"Very good. I just hope they get the message."

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

*"You must tell him something very important, soldier. We are after the bandits, and the Blackstone legion. He must tell his own forces that we mean them no harm. We are the Iron Legion. We wear green and yellow, and for today, we are allies."*

After several seconds of translating, the Warden looks back.

"He says that he understands, sir."

*"I just hope that this 'Shinobu' doesn't mistake our Peacekeeper for an enemy."*

"Or the reverse, sir."

Letting his weight off him, Captain Marius pulls Jozu up and claps him on his shoulders.

*"Tell him I am dearly sorry for his mistreatment, both by myself and our Conqueror friend."*

"I'll kill ye the next time I see ye, ye filthy mudwalker! **KILL YE!**"

The warden turns to Jozu, and speaks once more in Latin.

"The man with the shield says he overreacted, Jozu."

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Sheathing her sword and dagger quietly as the last of the archers collapse to the ground, the Peacekeeper looks around the bottom floor of the watchtower. A great wooden wheel sat on the far side of the room, surely the mechanism to open the gates. Shinobu had told her which tower to infiltrate. Apparently, their forces had the original blueprints for the castle, the same reason they found the secret tunnel so easily. She'd crack it open just slightly, so Marius' company could approach without alerting the enemy, and open it themselves. Now, she just had to reach the main tower, and rendezvous with Shinobu.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jozu sprinted briskly through the underbrush, arms trailing behind him and torso held low to minimize wind drag. Had to tell the general. Maybe he didn't care much if that crazy man died in the attack. He somehow doubted that what he said before he left really meant that he overreacted. And that man in the metal armor wasn't exactly nice either. But that woman... With her golden hair. Those blue, friendly eyes. That kind smile. He couldn't let her die because of some foolish mistake. Shinobu could handle herself in there, especially with the western ninja she had told him about helping her. She would never do something so foolish as mistake a potential comrade as an enemy. As he said, she could handle herself. He had to run.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Shinobu recited a prayer for the fallen at her feet, wicked though they were. Placing the western *bakudan* every few feet along the rows upon rows of bundled *ya*, she couldn't help but shudder at the sight of their lit fuses. A hourglass of flame. A ticking clock, counting down to the chaos ahead. Today, *Bara no Oka* fell. And, with hope, the *Oni\-shiseiji*, the mad berserker Koga Makoto, would fall with it. And, for some reason, maybe the fear on that western *jonin's* voice, she prayed for the *Nanban\-dono* to know justice, too.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

***The weak are meat: the strong eat.***

That was the proverb inscribed upon the banner waving limply above her head. To think that two monsters, both so similar in their shared madness, could be born onto this earth in the same lifetime, terrified the Peacekeeper. Closing her eyes, she prayed herself.

"Our lord and savior, see the good and righteous from this place, and send those who are wicked here to their just punishment, with he who was once your most beloved, the Morning Star."

"I see that I have arrived just in time, *nanban*."

"To see me offer prayer to a god I barely believe in anymore?"

"To light the banner, actually."

"Hmph. You remind me of myself when I was your age."

"And how so?"

"Blunt, disrespectful, and very good at killing people."

"You are different now?"

"Yes. Now I think I'm funny, and act like everyone's scary knife\-grandma."

"Ah. That's what I should call you, *Obāsan no Hōchō*. Now... let's begin. If we start now, the archers may finish their first volley and reach the storehouse to fill their *yebira* as it explodes. It'll save us some time clearing them out."

The peacekeeper removes a flint and steel from her pack.

***'Apollyon...You're not getting away this time.'***

Shaking the thought from her mind, the Peacekeeper smiles behind her mask, and reaches up to grip the great black flag.

"Shall we?"

1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot Apparently there’s a joke book called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’, and I was wondering if anyone here had heard of it, because I seriously want to get my hands on a copy.

I’ve been into dark humour for as long as I can remember. No topic is off-limits. Terrorism. Slavery. Dead babies. Whatever. I don’t care about things being offensive; as long as it’s a good joke, I’m up for it.

So when I heard about ‘1000 Dark Jokes’, I knew I wanted to read it. The problem is, it doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. I’ve searched for hours online, I’ve looked on Amazon and Waterstones, I’ve scoured the local bookshops and libraries (Side note – I discovered that libraries are still a thing!). I even contacted some of the biggest libraries in the country and asked them to search through their stock. Nothing. There wasn’t a scrap of evidence that this book had ever been written.

Except for one forum.

It’s one I’ve been lurking in for a long time, but never got around to posting in. A celebration of grim jokes and gross-out humour. It’s where I’ve read some of the best material I’ve ever come across. And some of the most downright awful.

It’s called RapeAndPunnage.org

As I was browsing through it a few weeks ago, I stumbled across this old thread, which is the only mention of ‘1000 Dark Jokes’ that I’ve been able to find anywhere. I thought of trying to summarise it for you lot, but I may as well just copy/paste the whole thread – it’s not that long – and hopefully someone here will be able to give me some pointers. Who knows, you might even recognise a username or two!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I found a book today in the second hand shop at the bottom of my street. It caught my eye because of the title, and straight away I thought of you lot. It’s a jokebook, with a blank front cover, and a title in embossed, silvery-black print down the spine. It’s called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’.

&gt;I’ve read a few now. They don’t seem to be what I’d call ‘jokes’. More like… statements. Or like –

&gt;Okay, I’ll type a few out and show you what I mean.

&gt;*#0001 – A man walks up to his doctor. “Help me,” he screams, “my lungs are burning!”. He collapses to the floor, and begins to cough blood onto the doctor’s new shoes. The doctors spits on him and laughs.*

&gt;That’s it. That’s the first joke in the book. I read it about a dozen times trying to see what I’d missed, whether there was a pun I wasn’t getting or something. But that really does seem to be it. And they’re all like that.

&gt;*#0012 – An old lady sits on a quiet beach. In the distance, she sees a flock of birds gliding past. She weeps, for she knows she will die alone.*

&gt;What kind of punchline is that? The jokes don’t seem to really set up anything, beyond describing horrible things happening to random people.

&gt;#0017 is just *A baby dies in agony*.

&gt;I have to admit, I did actually laugh at some of these. Not because they’re funny, but just from the sheer audacity of someone publishing this as a jokebook. But I’ve found I really enjoy reading through it, a couple dozen jokes at a time, while I’m on the bus or whatever. Do any of you guys own ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? Is there something I’m missing?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;LOL! Nvr heard of it but it sounds lik an absolute MINDFUCK! Got to get me a copy!! XD

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Its bettr thn any jokes uv evr cum up wth u pussy f@g!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;JITO, you’ve been warned before. Contribute to the discussion or not at all.

&gt;FG1988, I was really interested to see this get posted up. My sister had a copy of this, and we used to read it together after mom and dad had gone to bed. We were way too young, looking back. It’s probably what started me liking all of this sick shit come to think of it! Anyway, I’ll see if I can dig it out from somewhere. Out of interest, have you carried on reading it? Got any favorites?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Haha, can’t imagine a little kid reading this stuff! Some of it is proper intense! Do you remember the one about the cat, I think it was number thirty-something. Just a really detailed description of it being murdered.

&gt;My favourites are probably the ones that are less gruesome and more bizarre – they sort of leave you stunned for a moment wondering how anyone thought to print it!

&gt;Like *#0143 – A rich man and a poor man are standing on top of a mountain. The poor man says to the rich man, “We only have enough food to get one of us down the mountain”. The rich man says, “You should take it and go.” The poor man cries with gratitude, and promises to make a shrine to the rich man upon his arrival home. When the poor man is part way down the mountain, he is set upon by savage wolves, and killed. The rich man is among them. He feasts.*

&gt;I’ve just got this really funny mental image of the Monopoly Man covered in wolfskin, calmly cutting into a human arm with a knife and fork!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Huh. I partly remember that one. I thought it ended with something like “the rich man watched from a distance until he starved to death.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;I like number 399. ‘A nun is raped. She screams and screams, but it does not stop. She bleeds onto her robes, and dies. Her god is a lie.’

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;Fucking PWNED lol!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;“Her god is a lie.”

&gt;Hey, I take offence to that! ;P

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I’ve got it! Our old copy of 1TDJ. It’s dusty, and it’s definitely seen better days, but it’s just about held it together. I’ve found the joke I was remembering from earlier.

&gt;Number 679: *A dog loved its owner very much. One day, she lay down some food before it. The dog wanted the food very much, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down more food. The dog was very hungry, but the owner did not let it eat. The next day, she lay down even more food. The dog was in terrible pain, but the owner did not let it eat. The dog watched the food. The dog smelled the food. The dog sat by the food until it starved to death. The dog loved its owner very much.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;poor doggo :( i du lik dese jokes tho so i got tha book tuk me ages 2 find it but its grate so funny!

&gt;i lik the 1s with no animals tho

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I think it gets funnier the more you read. You get past a barrier, remind yourself that no one is actually being hurt, and that sort of lets you laugh at it. Does that make sense?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;xvxvxvxvxvx

&gt;You’ve got that backwards. Your “barrier” is stopping you from actually enjoying yourself. The real fun comes after you’ve finished reading, when you don’t need the book any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;What do you mean?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;rofl @ no. 582!! a child is asked 2 go 2 bed. they ask 4 mor time up. their parents rip ther skin away!!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;That’s really weird. I’ve just read #0852. It’s like a twisted mirror of that joke. *A child stands at the foot of their parents’ bed. The child bleeds. Their skin has been torn away. The parents weep. “Please don’t come to bed,” they cry. The child only smiles. They will always come to bed.*

&gt;That can’t be a coincidence, right? Is there come kind of narrative to this book?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;What if WE ARE THE NARRATIVE?! MIND = BLOWN!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Not a great medium for a narrative. Most people don’t read the jokes in order. Unless I guess it’s going for a whole “every experience is unique” deal, with each reader getting a different narrative based on the order they read the jokes in. I don’t really get that vibe from it though. I think you’re meant to just dip in and out of it when you want to. It’s more addictive that way, y’know?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;well im lovin it sooooo funny lol! gets bettr the mor u read

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I definitely agree with that. Although, I read the very last joke today. Have any of you guys looked at that one? Not what I expected. It’s a bit… weird.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;JewsInTheOven

&gt;lol 2 dark 4 u? get off the forum u f@g

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Nah, like I said above, I don’t read joke books cover to cover. I think I flicked past it once, but it seemed pretty long, and it looked like it repeated itself a lot. Was it good weird or bad weird?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;I’m not sure. I’ve read through it a few times now. It’s just a really odd one. I’ll try to copy it out (I’ll skip the middle bit, you’ll see why), but I guess you just have to read your own copy to get the full effect.

&gt;*#1000 – Once upon a time, there was a book of jokes. People read the book. They read jokes about death and rape and suffering, and they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed*

&gt;[It goes on like this for a few pages. I’ll skip to the final bit].

&gt;*The people laughed for a long, long time. They laughed until it hurt. Then they stopped laughing. The jokes in the book weren’t enough. They needed more than the book. They needed new jokes. They needed real jokes. They made their own jokes. And then they laughed. They laughed and laughed and laughed.*

&gt;It ends there. There are a couple of pages after it, but no text. I guess it’s a bit funny? In a sort of anti-humour kind of way?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;I guess so. I do always wonder what those blank pages at the back are for. Do they expect you to add your own jokes or something?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;it kinda creeped me out @ 1st but then i read it in the book an its pretty funny. like i get it more on the page if tha makes sence

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt;i keep goin bak an readin it an actuly its porbably my favorite now. i read it before bed evry nite

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Definitely! I feel exactly the same! I don’t read any of the other jokes any more. Last one is by far the best. Really grows on you.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;StabbyPete101

&gt; im gonna burn my cats eyes out tonite haha!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ZombieJeesus

&gt;LOL WTF?! XD

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;Pete, at the risk of being accused of being the responsible adult in the room: don’t do that.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;FG1988

&gt;Haha, record it! I want to watch!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;DontTellMom

&gt;FG, don’t encourage him. You’re better than that, dude.

&gt;What’s wrong? I just want you to laugh. And laugh and laugh and laugh.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

And that’s it. That’s the full thread. As far as I can tell, it’s the only one on the site, or anywhere else for that matter, that mentions ‘1000 Dark Jokes’. No, I don’t know what the deleted posts were, they were removed long before I got there. I can imagine, but I’d rather believe they weren’t what I think they probably were. In any case, of the users above, FG and StabbyPete don’t seem to have posted anywhere else after this. I’m pretty sure they were both banned. So was JewsInTheOven, but he kept posting after this. Nothing about the book, just troll drivel. DontTellMom stuck around for a long time, last active a few months ago, but didn’t reply to any private messages I sent. Neither did any of the others. It’s an old thread, they probably don’t use the forum anymore.

In any case, this is literally everything I know about ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make your Soul Rot’. Please, *please* tell me one of you knows about this book. I *need* to read it!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: So since posting this, the original thread has been deleted. Not sure if that’s a coincidence, but seems pretty odd timing.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit2: You’re not going to believe this! The book is real! Someone sent me a copy! Don’t know who, but *thank you!!!* Been reading through a few of them, it’s exactly as described above. Weird, but it’s great knowing it really exists! Must have already read through a hundred or so, it really does get funnier the further in you get! Once I’m finished I’ll share my favourites!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit3: Nearly done, now!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit4: They weren’t kidding about that last joke. It goes on over seven pages. Very funny though. Maybe the best one.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit5: It repeats “and laughed” exactly one thousand times. I counted.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit6: I’ve started making my own jokes now.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit7: Does anyone want to see a video of my baby sister?

Has Anyone Read ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’? [Apparently there’s a joke book called ‘1000 Dark Jokes to Make Your Soul Rot’](/r/JRHEvilInc), and I was wondering if anyone here had heard of it, because I seriously want to get my hands on a copy.

I’ve been into dark humour for as long as I can remember. No topic is off-limits. Terrorism. Slavery. Dead babies. Whatever. I don’t care about things being offensive; as long as it’s a good joke, I’m up for it.

So when I heard about ‘1000 Dark Jokes’, I knew I wanted to read it. The problem is, it doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. I’ve searched for hours online, I’ve looked on Amazon and Waterstones, I’ve scoured the local bookshops and libraries (Side note – I discovered that libraries are still a thing!). I even contacted some of the biggest libraries in the country and asked them to search through their stock. Nothing. There wasn’t a scrap of evidence that this book had ever been written.

Except for one forum.

It’s one I’ve been lurking in for a long time, but never got around to posting in. A celebration of grim jokes and gross-out humour. It’s where I’ve read some of the best material I’ve ever come across. And some of the most downright awful.

##Darkplace Chapter 2 Episode 6

**Agency HQ, London**

It was the morning after Harrington and Westwood had been dispatched to Darkplace, but in the headquarters of a mysterious United Nations-run international security agency, it was like the night had never ended. Gordon Cole had fielded a call from his two (or rather, one) men (man) in the field in the A.M hours of Monday night, which had bled into Tuesday morning so without remark that only the risen sun outside told the staff that any time at all had passed. Sleep deprived and caffeine-overdosed, the skeleton crew that had been in the building for the night shift soldiered on at the behest of Cole, who was pacing back and forth between the water cooler and the elevator outside his office as if he were a mysterious set of footprints on the Marauder’s Map that Harry Potter and his increasingly post-pubescent friends would have to investigate. Sandy Evans was almost asleep in the corner, while Alberto Cintron, who had only recently arrived, stood drinking a cup of coffee.

**ALBERTO:** So let me get this straight: Harrington and Westwood think that Earl has harnessed the power of some pseudo-historical wizard figure because of a vague and presumably sinister plan that he refuses to elaborate on, but continually alludes to? And he has a white giant as a minion, and all of this information came directly from the town’s local druid?

**COLE:** LOOK, I KNOW YA MIGHT HAVE YOUR RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE KOOKY SCENARIO THAT’S BEEN RELAYED TO US, BUT I BELIEVE ‘EM.

**ALBERTO:** Why? That just sounds, well, it sounds like some bullshit Mac would come up with to justify his far-too-large operational budget.

Alberto took a sip of his coffee, which was as black as the white giant that he was thinking of.

**ALBERTO:** Actually, could be Aquarius Jackson. He’d fit the bill.

**COLE:** DO YA THINK?

It should be noted that Director Cole had no conception of what Aquarius Jackson looked like whatsoever.

**ALBERTO:** I mean...it’d make sense is the issue. Aquarius fits the description, he was bailed by an unknown individual around the time Earl broke out, he’s been missing ever since.

**COLE:** LOOKS LIKE THE FACTS ADD UP, ALBERTO.

**ALBERTO:** I’m confident they actually don’t. I actually entirely expect some deus ex machina to present itself and render the entire conversation about Earl and Aquarius Jackson completely irrelevant. Maybe, I don’t fucking know, maybe Hitler’ll come back from the dead and launch WW3 against Switzerland.

**COLE:** DON’T JOKE ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT, EARL. THE RETURN OF THE FUHRER HAS BEEN A FEAR IN THE BACK OF MY MIND EVER SINCE THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE NAZIS HAD CLONING TECHNOLOGY.

**ALBERTO:** ….Did you just call me “Earl”?

**COLE:** NOPE.

**ALBERTO:** I’m pretty sure you did.

**COLE:** YA MIGHT BE DELUSIONAL, EARL. ER, I MEAN, ALBERTO.

Just then, probably to save him from further questioning, one of Gordon’s many goons came running down the hallway, tripping over the sedate and Snorlax-esque Sandy and banging into the wall headfirst.

**ALBERTO:** Sandy, you bitch, why did you have to trip that guy up? Goddamn, you’re such an obstacle!

**COLE:** SHE CAN’T HELP IT, ALBERTO. IT’S IN HER NATURE TO BE A BIG OLE ROADBLOCK.

Sandy groggily replied, but we don’t care enough to detail that. The agent that had been so rudely tripped up by her slowly picked himself up, probably none too happy about Sandy’s foul deeds.

**COLE:** WHAT’S GOING ON, PAL?

**AGENT:** Director Cole, sir, the top brass is ready to talk to you.

**COLE:** HOLY RAT KING, IT TOOK ‘EM LONG ENOUGH.

It had actually taken the top brass in New York over seven hours to return Cole’s call, a new record for the shadowy group that sat at the head of the Agency. Gordon had even gone through a period where he believed that the entirety of New York might have been hit by a highly advanced Russian or Chinese EMP device as part of a wider attack on the United States of America. Cole took off towards his office, leaving Alberto, Sandy, and all unnamed law enforcement trolls behind. When Cole entered his office, he found that his laptop had already been set up for his conference call with the top brass, so all he had to do was sit down and stare intently at the skype screen. On the other end of the horribly designed client sat the top brass, who were based a continent away from the HQ thanks to an unimaginable bureaucratic fuck-up in the late 90s, when Tony Blair had managed to convince the United Nations to move the headquarters of the Agency to London but Bill Clinton had, simultaneously, convinced them to keep it in New York, leading to the day-to-day operations heading to Britain, while the top dogs stayed stateside. All twelve executive leaders were sitting on a single table in matching robes, heads entirely shaved save for two pigtails on the head of James Forrestal, the spokesperson for the group. Things had not always been like this, but ever since an unfortunate incident twenty years ago, the top brass spoke only one at a time, and always, unwaveringly, in rhyme.

**FORRESTAL:** Director Cole, we found most odd your request, but we have still assembled at your behest.

**COLE:** IT TOOK YA LONG ENOUGH.

**FORRESTAL:** We move not through the constraints of mortal time, but rather through pastures of unwinnowed grass, as if kine.

**COLE:** O.K BUDDY!

**FORRESTAL:** Now that you stand before us, albeit on screen, I ask for what purpose did you this meeting convene?

**COLE:** WELL, YA KNOW, THERE’S A LOT OF REASONS A MAN DOES ANYTHING. MAYBE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT’S BECAUSE WE’RE ALL JUST APES TRYING TO KEEP ON KEEPING ON. I THINK SO, ANYWAY.

**FORRESTAL:** Still, for what specific reason did you call together this meeting? Surely not just for philosophical bleating.

**COLE:** I DON’T DO ANY OF THAT ANYMORE, FELLAS.

This was a lie, as Gordon had recently performed as a goat in his nephew’s school production of the Nativity.

**COLE:** MAYBE A LITTLE BIT, BUT WHO DOESN’T?

**FORRESTAL:** None among us can confess to the deeds you profess.

**COLE:** WELL, ANYWAY, Y’KNOW, THERE’S A KOOKY LIL BIT OF BUSINESS HAPPENING DOWN IN DARKPLACE. IT SEEMS THAT THE MAD EARL WINSTON HAS ESCAPED FROM PRISON AFTER KILLING THAT GUY IN ROME, AND HE NOW HAS WACKY MAGICAL POWERS, FELLAS.

**FORRESTAL:** These words that I hear, they provoke a reaction most severe.

**COLE:** I WAS HOPING THAT YOU’D LIFT THAT ZANY BAN YA’VE GOT ON ME GOING INTO THE FIELD SO I COULD DEAL WITH HIM, MANO TO MANO.

**FORRESTAL:** On the issue which you with your last statement have just spawned, with a “no” I must respond. I fear that should you for Darkplace depart, the agency would indeed soon without you fall apart.

**COLE:** I DON’T AGREE, SIR.

Cole had been expecting the grave threat of Earl Winston’s escape to mobilise the top brass, but it seemed that they had grown more distant from the day to day affairs of the world that he had anticipated.

**COLE:** LOOK, THE FOLKS I’VE GOT NOW JUST AREN’T EQUIPPED TO TACKLE EARL. IF I DON’T DO IT, THINGS ARE GONNA GO FROM BAD TO WORSE THAN BAD: TO BAD SQUARED, SIR.

**FORRESTAL:** To spare this answer becoming trinal, know that my rejection is firmly final.

**COLE:** IF YOU’LL EXCUSE THE LANGUAGE, THIS WHOLE THING IS KINDA VAGINAL.

Gordon Cole had clearly had enough of this big gubment bureaucracy bullbr*own and decided to shut his laptop without so much as saying goodbye to his higher-ups. He then exited his office and walked out in the hall, where he was greeted with a sight which the agency director might regard as “KOOKY.” None other than Phil Farage, the equally odious cousin of Nigel, was standing in the middle of the hallway, wearing an adult diaper and completely lathered in baby oil. Two agents were attempting to capture him, but he easily slid out of their grasp thanks to his slippery nature.

**FARAGE:** You elitists have been conspiring to sabotage brexit in your safe spaces for far too long! It’s time we took back control of this high-rise, and gave it to a good, british businessman, like Roman Abramovich!

Another agent lunged at Farage, grabbing him around the waist, but Phil slid right out from under him and down the hallway, shouting all the while about blue passports. Let’s face it, folks: The man’s just slippery. So slippery, in fact, that he was unable to stop himself with an open elevator shaft presented itself a few moments later and slid right into it, falling to his apparent doom, but we should trust Farage to be able to weasel his way out of death.

**COLE:** WHAT THE HECK.

At this moment, Alberto rounded the corner, holding a large fishing net. When he saw that Farage was nowhere to be seen, he dropped it to the ground and approached his boss.

**ALBERTO:** Just a problem with Phil Farage, Gordon. It turns out that UKIPers have nothing to do after Brexit except join the Folkish Band, and if they don’t like that, they turn to, well…

**COLE:** KIDDY LOTION?

**ALBERTO:** I would never phrase it like that, but sure.

**COLE:** OKAY PAL.

It wasn’t.

**COLE:** ALBERTO, COME INTO MY OFFICE, AND TELL SANDY, IF SHE’S NOT ON HER PERIOD, TO CALL IN AUSTIN CLEMENS.

Alberto resolved to do the first one and not the second, and hoped God would just intervene to prevent him from having to talk to the secretary, still lying in the hallway.

**St. John’s Chapel, Darkplace**

Sheriff Harry Wilson and his brother were currently in the graveyard of St. John’s Church, continuing their ongoing investigation into the mysterious serial rapist known only as the Night Stalker. While yesterday’s questioning of Brad had proved largely unfruitful for the police, investigation of CCTV footage from the parts of the town that hadn’t been impacted by the blackout had shown a figure matching Margaret Hurley’s description of the Night Stalker making his way into the graveyard in the early hours of the morning, after he had attacked Brad and Jenny. A large crowd seemed to have gathered outside the doors of the chapel a few hundred metres away, but Harry and Jimmy paid them no heed, searching through the headstones and weeds for any clues the sex beast might have left behind. The brothers Wilson walked between rows (or, if you wanted to be real pedantic, columns) of gravestones of varying sizes, denoting the deceased person’s social standing, while they talked, occasionally glancing down at them as they passed to see if they recognised any names. The cemetery had seen increased activity in recent months thanks to the epic comeback staged by the plague, and as such, the gravediggers were forced to fill the gaps between adjacent graves with fresh corpses, many of which didn’t even have headstones. As they were walking down the narrow aisles between graves, Harry noticed that his brother’s footsteps had ceased, and turned around to see Jimmy standing in front of a tombstone.

**J. WILSON:** Shoot, Harry, you might wanna come check out this here headstone.

Confused, the sheriff walked back to where Jimmy was currently standing. His brother pointed downwards at the modestly-sized, granite slab, which bore, alongside a date of birth and death, the epitaph: “Here lies Leanne Davies, caring mother, loving wife, and member of her community. An angelic soul gone too soon.”

**H. WILSON:** You don’t reckon that’s the same Leanne Davies that was married to Phil Davies, do ya?

It was. Leanne Davies had, in fact, been one of the first Darkplacers to come down with the Black(er) Death which was especially unlucky considering it had only been a matter of months since the death of her husband and scarcely a year since that of her daughter. These two immense losses, along with that of her niece, Judy, were enough to send Leanne into a spiraling depression, which she tried to alleviate with the help of copious amounts of alcohol. Eventually, there was seldom a time Leanne couldn’t be seen without a glass of *something* in hand, a fact which, coupled with her increasingly reclusive behaviour, made for a dangerous mix. She thought that if she drank enough, she could somehow forget the loss of her daughter and husband and, therefore, forget the pain, but the only thing she found in drink was more sorrow and the dulling of her senses. Leanne was numb alright, but she certainly wasn’t comfortable. Her discomfort would only increase, though, when she caught the plague after coming into contact with one of the rats that had taken to living in the squalor of the neglected Davies residence. Had she picked up on the symptoms she would soon suffer from, she could have taken herself to the Royal Free Hospital and received top-notch treatment for her illness. Yet Leanne Davies could hardly feel her own hands, let alone realise the gravity of her condition, and so it was there, on the bathroom floor amid a pile of discarded bottles, and shite, for some of her pills were laxatives, that she joined her husband and daughter in Heaven, or alternatively, in a dumpster as part of a Chinese bubo-positive corpse smuggling scheme with her actual grave being filled by Clive, one of the law gnomes.

**J. WILSON:** I don’t know, brother, Leanne Davies is a pretty common name ‘round here, innit?

According to the website howmanyofme.com, the name Leanne was the 1,500th most common given name in the Anglish Edfolkness, finishing just behind Æthelwulf and a bit before Cunegonde, while Davies was unsurprisingly one of the more common surnames. As for Leanne Davies, that same website had 500 known people with that name in the Edfolkness, with only five of those being in southeastern Angland. Thanks, howmanyofme.com!

**H. WILSON:** I don’t know, maybe? Either way, I don’t see what relevance a dead Leanne Davies could have to this case.

**J. WILSON:** Could be that the Night Stalker is the secret second child of Philip and Leanne, intent on followin’ the dark deeds of his pa, and this is where he worships ‘em, on account of Phil’s corpse having been turned into manure by Big Ed.

**H. WILSON:** Yeah, I’m still not happy about that -

**J. WILSON:** Was the only way.

**H. WILSON:** And your theory is completely retarded. To begin with, why would Philip and Leanne hide their son from the world?

**J. WILSON:** Maybe he has devil eyes. I reckon both him and Elizabeth got devil parts on account of Phil being some kind of satanic wacko. Couldn’t pass off...Elizer Davies’ demon eyes as quickly as they could pass off Elizabeth’s sin-black skin as her just being an adopted coon child.

**H. WILSON:** What the hell are ya talking about, Jimmy? Elizabeth Davies was in no way black!

**J. WILSON:** Who the heck am I thinking of, then?

Jimmy had actually confused a strange dream of his last night involving the Obama family with the clan Davies, and his mind was on either Sasha or Malia - honestly, who knows which one is which? - when his mouth had been on Elizabeth or the fictitious Eliezer.

**H. WILSON:** I don’t know, and I don’t really care. I just hope Andy’s having more luck than we are.

Deputy Smalls poked his head up from behind a nearby headstone, where had been hiding from the nearby congregation of churchgoers, whose great number made him anxious. Andy seemed to have been surprised to hear his name mentioned, for some likely mind boggling reason.

**ANDY:** No diggity, Sheriff! I hope you’re havin’ a lucky day too!

Andy tried to climb out over the top of the grave that he had been hiding behind, however his act of mild graveyard desecration was halted when he stuck his weight down onto what seemed to be a black sock sitting atop the pebbles. The second Andy stuck his hand down onto the sock, which had been his only natural landing point while trying to clamber over the tombstone, it popped flat, and a large amount of an all-too familiar white liquid squirted out over the grave and, in splashes, onto the grass surrounding it. It was semen. Andy let out a yell of disgust, his hand now covered in the substance, significantly increasing his chances of contracting HIV. Jimmy looked like he was about to vomit, and that was before he saw the name on the grave: Elizabeth Davies, 1971-1989. Wait, no, we mean 2011-2029.

**J. WILSON:** Some faggot left a cum-sock on the darkie’s grave!

**H. WILSON:** Right, again, not black, but...aside from that, you’re right.

**ANDY:** Aw geel, Sheriff, I just wonder who would do something like that to poor Lizzie’s grave!

**H. WILSON:** Well, assuming this isn’t related to the string of rapes we’re currently investigating, I’d guess this was probably the work of one of Lizzie’s lovers. God knows she had a lot of those.

**J. WILSON:** Girl was a real whore, by my reckonin’.

**H. WILSON:** Nice, Jimmy, that’s real nice.

**J. WILSON:** I’m just bein’ honest, brother. You know me, Harry, I like to tell it how it is. I don’t give two hoots about what’s considered pee-cee, I skirt the Overton window, I play fast and loose with the rules, I trigger the heck outta snowflakes!

**H. WILSON:** You could’ve just said, “I’m an asshole,” Jimmy.

**J. WILSON:** That’s just what you libtards call anyone who dares to question the MSM narrative! If’n ya had your way, we’d all be wearin’ the skin of niggers by the end of the year, and I don’t mean as clothin’.

**H. WILSON:** Right, well, if you’re quite finished, we should probably bag that cum-sock as evidence.

**J. WILSON:** Ain’t no way in hell I’m pickin’ that thing up! I don’t want none of that ‘aitch-eye-vee crap!

**H. WILSON:** I was actually thinking Andy should be the one to grab it, since he already touched it. I mean, if he’s already AIDs then what’s he got to lose?

**J. WILSON:** I like the way you think, brother. Alright, Andy, you best get to work then, boy!

**ANDY:** Gee, alright fellas, but my hands is still all cut up!


**J. WILSON:** Looks like you’re gonna have to get creative, son!

Getting “creative with it” to Andy apparently meant using your mouth instead of your hands, as this was precisely what he did with the sock after being commanded to pick it up. With the sock, which was somehow crusty while still dripping in certain places, secure between his two front teeth, Andy stood in front of Harry like a dog which had just fetched a protein-rich, putrid-smelling tennis ball for his master.

**J. WILSON:** Look at this faggot, Harry. Looks almost fucking happy to be standing there with a splurge-rag in his mouth! I betcha do this every day whenever ya clock off!

**H. WILSON:** Now that you mention it...Andy, y’do look overly enthusiastic about having a sock full of stale spunk in your mouth.

Andy made a garbled noise in reply.

**H. WILSON:** What?

Andy dropped the sock out of his mouth and into his unbendable hands, taking great care not to let it fall onto the floor.

**ANDY:** Aw shucks, I just...I like to be useful, is all.

**J. WILSON:** Yeah, I bet you tell that to all them sissy-ass twinks you let pound your shit-covered bunghole!

**ANDY:** Sure do, Jimmy! How’d you know? ‘Cause I was under the impression I was the only guy talked to my food these days.

Despite what you may think, Andy wasn’t actually trying to make some shit “you are what you eat” joke here. In fact, he wasn’t aware of what a twink was, and assumed that Jimmy meant to say “twinkies,” which was his favourite dish, if you’re retarded enough to consider something that comes in plastic wrapping a dish. Andy ate so many of them, in fact, that the only thing keeping him from pulling a Mary and getting morbidly obese was his unnaturally high metabolism, something we haven’t mentioned before because it hasn’t been relevant to our narrative until now. Andy’s proclivity towards the cream-filled snack did present a different kind of problem, however, in that because Hostess, the company behind twinkies, ding-dongs, ho-hos and other suggestively-named junk foods, had stopped its UK operation after the UK stopped existing, he had to specially order shipments of twinkies to his home each month, a very costly undertaking indeed. No cost, however high, though, would keep Andy away from his twinkies, and that was that.

**J. WILSON:** By heck…

**H. WILSON:** Let’s pretend that this conversation never took place and just, y’know, get back to the law bus with our new cum-sock.

**ANDY:** Do ya think Masala will be there, Harry??

Deputy Masala had not been seen since he ran off from the Walker residence yesterday, shouting about Allah and other such pagan deities that, being a Hindu, he didn’t worship.

**J. WILSON:** Maysala’s probably halfway back to Islamabad by now, Andy. Likely gonna join up with them Mujahadeen that just ran Ivan Ruski outta Afghanistan or Ay-Raq or one a’ them places.

**H. WILSON:** No, Andy, I don’t think Masala’s going to be there, but I also doubt he’s in goddamn Afghanistan.

The Sheriff had been served with enough bullshit for one day, and turned to trudge up the graveyard and towards the chapel carpark, where the mighty law bus could be found. Andy and Jimmy followed him, the former not wishing to become lost in the vast field of bones. As they neared St. John’s, they could see that the dozens-strong crowd hadn’t dissipated at all. It seemed that the people of Darkplace had turned out in force to stand, agitated, outside the front doors of the temple, and loudly argue amongst themselves. The usual suspects were among the crowd, as well as the kooky newcomer Drifter Norris, an itinerant hobo who had been blown into town by the winds of fate, only to find that were they to blow him any further, he would end up in the sea. Amid the commotion, one familiar-ish face, that of Rosie Blair (formerly Nance) shoved her way to the front of the crowd, and began to address her fellow Darkplacers.

**ROSIE:** My fellow citizens of Darkplace and followers of Christ, the end is nigh!

A series of gasps erupted from the gathering of prospective worshippers.

**ROSIE:** Yes, you heard me, the end is fast approaching! Our great faith leader, Father Damien, is nowhere to be found! By my estimation, he is probably preparing for the impending apocalypse, which, as the Book of Revelations tells us, shall bring much bloodshed and chaos! But fear not, my friends, for the Rapture draws ever nearer, and when it does arrive, all those of us who truly believe in His word shall be lifted up from this cursed and hellish earth and taken in to the Kingdom of God! Conversely, all those among us who engage in sinful behaviour while still claiming their love of God and his sons, Jesus and Damien, shall be condemned to suffer here through the end times and then in hell for eternity! So, Darkplace, who shall it be, Christ or Corbyn, the Bible or the Communist Manifesto?

The crowd’s reaction to Rosie’s sermon was split, with half wildly applauding while the other half stood there scratching their heads and processing this information. Eventually, one of them decided to make their voice heard. It was Jeremy “Big Stacks” Thatcher, local rapper and someone who we couldn’t fault you for thinking would never appear again in our tale. Believe it not, Big Stacks was also an ardent believer in God, Jesus, burning bushes, and all that mumbo jumbo, and he had some questions for Ms. Blair.

**BIG STACKS:** Oi, dat’s good and all, but wot the ‘eck are ‘sposed to do in da meantime, lady??

**ROSIE:** Very good question, Mr. Stacks. This is something which I think we, as a fellowship, ought to discuss amongst ourselves. Personally, I would suggest hunkering down somewhere secure and waiting out like Father Damien surely is.

**BIG STACKS:** Wot, y’mean like some kinda bunker or wot?

**ROSIE:** It could be that, yes. We should be prepared to defend ourselves against the sinful hordes in these coming months. Thank you, Jeremy, and God bless you. Would anyone else like a chance to speak?

At this stage Margaret Hurley, who had become a passionate follower of Damien since her rape a few days ago, raised her hand and began to speak.

**MARGARET:** Shouldn’t we petition the Pope in Rome to appoint us a new priest, Rosie??

At least one person in the crowd took issue with Margaret’s mention of the Pope, and decided to speak. It was Michael Coleman, head of the local BNP, whose party, like that of Phil and Nigel Farage, had similarly fallen upon hard times due to the Folkish Band practically stealing much of their platform and throwing in some socialist-ish rhetoric and pro-forest themes for good measure.

**COLEMAN:** The Pope lost all of his authority the second he set foot in a Mosque!!!!!

The remark was met with a number of “ayes” from the crowd, despite the fact that the Pope he was most likely referring to here, Pope Francis, had been dead for at least two decades.

**COLEMAN:** And when he washed all those muzzies’ feet, am I right folks?!!  He sucked on their toes!!

Egads.

**ROSIE:** Margaret does raise a good point about who shall lead our flock in the absence of Damien. Does anyone have any ideas they would like to propose?

One churchgoer raised his hand at this.

**ROSIE:** Yes, speak.

**CHURCHGOER:** What if we randomly choose who gets to be priest for that week, like out of a hat or something?

**ROSIE:** This is a very interesting proposal. What does the congregation think?

The congregation agreed, and it was so. After reaching a proper solution to their vicarlessness, the flock finally headed on into the chapel to choose this week’s priest out of a hat.

**Marc Bolan Memorial Retail Park**

After deciding amongst themselves that they must return to the McDonalds which they believed to be serving up Breeder juice to unwitting customers, the East Side jets once again found themselves sitting in the parking lot of the restaurant in question. The gang, which, as a reminder, consisted of Joey Ashebrooke, Dave “Strike Eagle” Lanterman,” Smokey, Bueno Excelente, “Rudeboy” Rudy, and a few as-of-yet-unnamed faces, were all crammed into the minivan that Strike Eagle currently had to drive in lieu of his muscle car. They appeared to be putting their clothes back on after a hot gangbang on wheels. We say appeared because, unlike their rivals, the Junkgoys, the Jets didn’t swing that way. No, they were, in actuality, in the midst of changing into some McDonalds uniforms they had managed to get ahold of by virtue of the fact that the fast-food joint had an abnormally high turnover rate and it was fairly easy to find a handful of disgruntled former employees with no use for their old uniforms. As they all finished slipping into the black, polyester uniforms, Joey decided now might be a good time to talk strategy before they headed into the belly (or ballsack) of the beast.

**JOEY:** Alright, bros, I don’t want any fuck-ups when we’re behind enemy lines, so does anyone have any questions before we head in?

**LANTERMAN:** Man, I still think we shoulda gone with my plan with the balaclavas and shit, having all these civvies around makes me anxious.

**JOEY:** That wasn’t a question, man.

**LANTERMAN:** Okay, well why didn’t we go with my plan?

**JOEY:** Because a) we don’t have any balaclavas or grappling hooks and b) your plan would’ve probably got the cops called on us, and I don’t know about you, bros, but I don’t know if I can go back to the slammer again.


It should be noted here that he hadn’t actually been to the “slammer,” a term typically used in reference to longer prison stays. What Joey was surely referring to here was his overnight stay at the Darkplace Sheriff’s station’s jail in which his only other fellow inmate was Strike Eagle.

**LANTERMAN:** Alright, whatever man, just don’t get mad if I accidentally gun down a few civvies on accident!

**BUENO:** Ay holmes, you didn’t tell me we were supposed to bring our pieces, man.

**JOEY:** Man, we’ve been over this, no one’s bringing their pieces. I don’t know what Strike Eagle’s talking about so let’s just move on, alright? Smokey, you haven’t said a word since we picked you up, what’s going on, big guy?

Smokey, who had indeed been silent the entire five-minute drive, finally turned around from the window to address his bro’s concern.

**SMOKEY:** Nah man, I’m good, I was just thinking about some stuff.

**JOEY:** Like..?

**SMOKEY:** The sauce, man, it’s the fucking sauce again.

**JOEY:** Trust me, bro, the sauce isn’t gonna be a problem after today.

**BUENO:** Are we gonna eat it all, ese?

**JOEY:** Bro, why the fuck would we eat it??! That’s exactly what the Breeder wants! Nah, we’re going to fucking burn it, or well, maybe not burn it since that’ll probably smell awful, but we’re definitely gonna dispose of it.

**LANTERMAN:** Maybe we shouldn't, man? Maybe we just disrupt the flow. Let people eat their spunkburgers for as long as McD’s supply lasts.

**JOEY:** We’ll figure out what to do with it once we actually get it, alright? Now let’s get going, the next shift is about to start.

Joey threw the sliding door of the minivan open and the Jets climbed out in their matching uniforms, looking for all the world like a culinary schutzstaffel. They headed through the carpark, passed the Marc Bolan statue and the entrance of Costa Coffee, the main competitor to Starbucks in the Anglish Edfolkness, before arriving at the McDonalds, which they were able to distinguish from the Burger King opposite it by the gigantic M high up in the sky above the store roof. Although they had originally planned to go in through the front, Joey noticed that the staff entrance was open, and so despite not knowing the passcode, they were able to enter like any other band of working stiffs. Confronted with the busy backstage area of the Grant’s leading fast food operation, shelves, bags of frozen thai chicken, frying fries, barely literate Indian workers and all, the Jets briefly froze, but a manager made his way over to them, apparently thinking that they were some new workers that were meant to start that day. They were parcelled out, with Joey sent to mop the floors, Smokey on chicken duty, Strike Eagle to the drive-thru, and Bueno on the grill, and then, despite their best efforts and intentions, they worked for over two hours before they were able to pretend that they were going on a lunch break, and meet up beside a trashcan in the corner of the kitchen.

**LANTERMAN:** I don’t know about you, bros, but I haven’t worked this hard before in my life! I totally feel for the plight of the working man now!

**BUENO:** I can’t believe all the free food they give you here, holmes!

In fact, McDonalds was notorious for not providing its employees with any free food. Bueno had instead been eating the food he cooked to order, not realising that it wasn’t for him.

**JOEY:** Man, why do you keep eating the Breeder’s jizz? Like, what’s going on up in your head that you keep doing that shit?

**BUENO:** Don’t knock it until you try it, loco.

._.

**SMOKEY:** Just, like, don’t eat that shit, man. Alright gang, we’ve gotta investigate this shit. There’s a big vat of the stuff over by my station, and it looks like it’s getting pumped in from outside.

**LANTERMAN:** I bet the pipes go all the way to breed central!

**JOEY:** You’re probably right, man, but we need to find out for certain before we take any action against these spunk merchants. Smokey, show us the vat, would ya?

Smokey nodded and led the Jets down a crowded bit of corridor which led to the chicken frying room, or chickenry, where he had been assigned to work. The chickenry was one of the core components of every McDonalds establishment, as it was where the nuggets were made from the pink slime that was supposed to be chicken, or at the very least some byproduct of chicken. Consequently, a large portion of the staff were assigned there on any given day, and it was filled with a great many uniformed McChurls when the Jets headed over to it. Amid the great many machines used to turn slime into nuggets was a circular vat, no doubt the one Smokey had spoken of earlier, which did not appear to have any outward purpose other than to take up space. The gang slowly made their way across the room and to the vat, passing rows of machinery and employees as they did so. Finally, they arrived at the raised, circular structure and, after doing a quick scan around them for any potential eavesdroppers, proceeded to peer down into its depths. As expected, the vat contained “the sauce” in all its white, sticky, and probably protein-rich glory.

**LANTERMAN:** This is industrial scale, bros…

Bueno tipped his hand into the liquid, and gave it a good lick.

**BUENO:** This is definitely Big Mac sauce, gringos.

**JOEY:** Why, man? Just...why?

**LANTERMAN:** Ignore that, bro, we’ve gotta get some of this sauce!

Strike Eagle did not mean that in the sense of eating the sauce, but rather that they had to grab some of it for testing purposes. The Jets had brought specially-purchased milk containment bags (Which were popular in Canada, and less so in the civilised world) for this purpose, and quickly began filling them to the brim with large quantities of the Breeder’s suspected love juice. As this was happening, another group of employees rounded the corner, ready to begin their shift at the chicken bar. The sight of their purported coworkers filling their carry-on pockets with special sauce caused much confusion, and eventually a shift manager appeared to find out what was going on.

**MANAGER:** What the hell’s going on here?!

**SMOKEY:** Shit, man, it’s the feds! Grab whatever breed juice you’ve got and bail!

The Jets took off sprinting out of the store, with Joey dropping his bag of sauce, which hit the floor and exploded all over the chicken station. They left behind an irate middle-manager and a horde of befuddled McChurls, who probably believed they’d just been raided by Burger King. The manager turned around to one of his employees, forehead veins bulging.

**MANAGER:** Get me the phone...I’ve got to talk to Hurley about this.

**Darkplace Town Square**

The people of Darkplace had once again turned out in force for a political event based around their fast approaching by-election, to be held on Thursday. Unlike the debate that had been held on Sunday, today’s affair was a strictly partisan rally for the Folkish Band, and candidate Pete Nance. Pete, who had the charisma of a disabled gopher, was kept far away from the limelight, and you could be forgiven for not even realising that he was the one running for parliament, otherwise known as the lawmoot. At present, the Overlord was delivering a speech playing to both the Folkish Band faithful and the voters that had returned the disgraced and dead Philip Davies as the MP at the last election, under a banner that simply read: “Choose Folkish - For The Folk”, with no mention of either Pete or his campaign manager, the radical communist Joan Blair. Up next was supposedly the First Ambighter, but the rumour on the ground was that Corbyn had returned to London in order to push through universal basic income, a policy that was facing much resistance from Brian Eno (in absentia) and Roger Waters, whose wing of the party argued that the churls needed an incentive to work the land and provide food for the folk, while Corbyn and John McDonnell suggested that this could be accomplished by reserving the best housing for government-employed workers.

**MORRISSEY:** - And so I beseech you, Darkplace, do not mourn the loss of your Sawmill, for that which had it befallen was forthspelled by Wyrd. While we can not downspeak the work it gave the meanship, we must also acknowledge the truth that these good upgivings were but short-lived and, in time, there would be no more trees to cut down. It is time we look to the tocome for new ways to harness the might of our land, ways which do not recklessly sap it of its orshafts. But fear not, burghers of Darkplace, you will not be without work. Nay, your work shall be more uplifting than ever, for rather than cut trees down, you shall put new ones up! I say, this is truly the greatest deed of gainstanding one can do against the worldwide geldpushers, those men who for years forthfaringly strongfucked our beloved land and indeed our folk. Now angry that they can no longer do such misdeeds, they lash out at our Folkish Meanship at every opening. They brook their handdolls in the Cow-thieving mootband to forseek to stop the forward march of the folk at each step of the way. This is their goal when they send in men like Jacob Rees-Mogg to beset our own runners, and it is your job by choosing to stop the Cow-thieves in their tracks. For the sake of this land, the geldpushers and their tools must be stopped, and each and every one of you can help in this deal by choosing against the Cow-thieves in this upcoming by-choosing and for the Folkish Band. We m-

Suddenly, the attentive silence that typically accompanied one of the Overlord’s speeches was broken by the sound of clapping somewhere off in the distance. Morrissey donned an annoyed glare as he scanned the crowd for the source of this great disturbance, until finally he saw *him* walking down the aisle. Him, er, he was none other than Gideon Oliver “George” Osborne, former Chancellor of the Exchequer under David Cameron and noted coke fiend. Gideon continued to clap his hands together as he made his way down the aisle, before finally taking a seat in the front row. The Overlord stared the newcomer down for a good thirty seconds before addressing him with an accusatory point of his finger.

**MORRISSEY:** You… What is the meaning of this? Have your lords, the worldwide geldpushers, gotten so hopeless as to send in one of their old tools to beset me?

The crowd let out a chorus of raucous laughter and jeering at their leader’s remarks. After the noise finally subsided, Gideon, who maintained the same smug look he had on while walking down the aisle, cleared his throat.

**GIDEON:** Mr. Morrissey, with all due respect, I’d like to think the people of Darkplace would like some geld pushed onto them, because goodness knows they’d had none of that under five years of this government!

Despite the fact that Gideon was a notorious proponent of austerity and other geldhoarding measures, the pointed nature of his retort sent the assembled groundlings into a wild frenzy of “ohs.” Simply put, their fearless leader had been BTFO’d and many of them weren’t quite sure how to cope with it. This verbal takedown, no matter how unfactual, rendered the Overlord speechless. Gideon, meanwhile, leaned back in his seat with his hands folded in his lap and that same smug look about him. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s reinforcements had arrived in Darkplace, courtesy of the Tribe.

Austin area- cost of ticket for unregistered bike? Basically I've spent the last 30 minutes looking for this and I've found one thing from the DMV, 160 dollar total fine for riding an unregistered bike, but what else is involved? Will they impound? Or can I leave it at ___ and pick it up in a truck? Can my license be revoked?

I'm trying to get a motorcycle home from about 20 miles away, and it has everything to be road legal except registration and plates. I will be taking feeder and back roads, following the speed limit, in full gear, and no wheelies or wot on the way home. How likely am I to get caught/ ticketed/ arrested and impounded?

Thanks guys

Mage General Skill Guide Making this to break up the recent shit posts / complaint threads that we've been riddled with. This comes from my experience leveling Mage to end game in both KR and JP and from the skill guide put together by Carthh and Wizra here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQdITjyFoxT1ALCgkAu_oB5dgEGgGy3dw20M41hFDIz-v1UarrKg7kDjdogJTsd6tRn6_XcAhnFcj2f/pubhtml#

AOE:
Fireball (AOE): Does decent damage over a moderate area
Fiery Meteor: meh damage, use Flamestrike instead
Flamestrike: Typical meteor strike type skill, good initial damage and DoT
Fiery Explosion: This skill is a must have, it is your nuke, it is your God hand. You fire this baby off and watch people melt. You que this skill up and your nads hit the seat of your pants in seconds. You have the lady elves, the thot humans, and the stripper midget mascu's begging for your loins. This skill is the skill that makes all other skills look like they belong in BDO. You put this thing on your hotbar and you're instant 5 stars in Basel Canyon.
Frozen Ground: meh damage but nice movement speed reduction
Icy Wave: Good damage done to a cone in front of you
Chain Lightning: Good initial damage, loses umph as it passes through targets.
Lightning Explosion: Meh
Typhoon: Meh damage but pulls enemies in

Utility:
Incandescence: Does low damage but will [Stun] enemies with [Burn]
Static Charge: When used on an ally: boosts movement speed by 30% for 8secs. When used on an enemy: reduces movement speed by 30% for 8secs.
Gust: Deals moderate damage, knocks foes back
Chilling Wind: low damage, knock back
Freezing: The holy grail of FU. Deals moderate damage for 8secs and slows movement speed by 10% then after the 8secs freezes the target solid for 3secs. This skill is great for setting up some distance to cast Fiery Explosion and melt some face.
Typhoon: Deals mediocre damage but pulls mobs in. good for setting up a group to nuke
Along the WInd: Turns you into a semi truck hauling a whole load of "u foking wot m8?" You teleport ahead of you becoming immune to CC and if you pass through the target do a decent amount of damage while throwing on your pair of sunglasses all smug. Then if used again, you teleport back to whence this FU bomb was originally cast. Have fun trying to channel Snipe, Ranger scum.

DoTs / Channel skills:
Freezing: refer to above
Blizzard: Channels for 7.5secs dealing damage around you periodically. any movement cancels the channel. Please don't use this in pvp
Piercing Wind: Lets hope this baby works like it did in JP because this is the only Atmosphere skill really worth it. Once you let this sucker off it was a golden ray of "hey, heres a good place for you to rest ... forever." You started channeling this thing in 3v3 and your target just stopped moving and accepted their fate. It channels for 6.5 seconds and deals good damage throughout. Pop this thing and watch their health bar do the electric slide straight to zero. You pop this thing on 1 unfortunate fellow and then Fiery Explosion on another and the enemy team just bends over.

Mages are fairly squishy so situational awareness is a must. The first leveling dungeon is easy and can be face tanked but the second one is where you have to start refining your skills and start gettting gud. If you're going to pull large mobs you have to pop a potion BEFORE you really need it to pad your health and let the cd run to when you really need it. Pulling moderate mobs shouldn't be too big of a hassle but the new stance system may make it a bit harder. Remember to use your Magic Absorption combo to regen your mana and be aware of your limitations.

All in all Mage is a very fun class to play and I plan to main it in the Steam version having played Mage, Zerker, Pally, and Guardian to level cap in the other versions.

Have fun and see ya in Basel Canyon!

Vynil's RedViews for EST-SUN Week 1 Most of my rankings held strong, though not all turned out as planned. Side note, if you notice any really harsh seeming statement just know that I know the ones I'm insulting.

# Playoffs

## [Melliflox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxHE_Jfnho&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m13s)

**Current Record: 2-0**

[Famed Lycan player Melliflox](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3080409600) managed to win week 1 2-0. This team is practicing a ton and should continue to do well against any team in the division. 22-10 Game 1 with not a single person on Melliflox's team dying more than 3 times. Minus a few flawed teamfights this team is set to be The Friendship Forgery with actual friendship and practice. Filski and NutR continue to go well together even with being a map apart from each other most of the time. Melliflox himself managed to secure 10LH/min on Luna game 1 before nearly halving that number by picking Lycan game 2. Ironically, the Lycan game lasted longer than the Luna game, but I guess that might be because NutR was feeding his ass off on Disruptor game 2. Longoria continues to impress in the middle lane with a double dose of Zeus this week and a KDA of 27. ShmeeZZy meanwhile gets to play Position 5 Version 2 for the team, not quite clearly fitting into the position 4 role yet but doing well nonetheless. Practice doesn't make perfect but Melliflox is bound to carry until his fur falls off or his [interesting item builds betray him](https://i.imgur.com/YPFAEzZ.jpg).

Red Says: My ferocious friend finds fantastic victory with furry fury dismantling We's team with a total of 65 minutes between both games. What's really scary is this team will only get better, faster than other teams. I have mad respect for any team able to take a game off this lad. #JoinTheCultOfMelliflox

## Mikel

**Current Record: 2-0**

Turns out Mikel is a competent Storm Spirit player. Picking a single stun might have facilitated this pick. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to rape a minor this hard but Mikel had no mercy, going 16-1-8 on Storm against CosmiK's 1-7-3 Shadow Fiend. Habits' Timbersaw didn't even die and secured more gold than the enemy SF by the end of the game. This is just a textbook stomping. Coop somehow managed to tank most important ganks, proving that his true value is in warning others of impending doom. Watz did Doom things in the offlane. Darbax had 69% [nice] kill participation on Night Stalker game 1 before improving to 73% kill participation game 2 on Skywrath. CosmiK won mid on Cancer.hero, proving that Viper can be overcome but not stopped, as Habits managed to end the game 17-5-21. Mikel played Spectre and had his team setup kills for him (notably, an especially good teamfight at 16 min followed by a 3-for-5 trade at 39:30) before Coop multicast Bloodlust on him and the Radiant throne fell. Watz apparently decided that 0 deaths was no fun and went for maximum deaths, dying more than Coop's Ogre on Axe. Though, Axe played his role well, turning fights for his team (especially that one at 16 min, watch that shit) and catching the Tinker.

## RedondO

**Current Record: 2-0**

The wannabe-Filski played his 4 predominantly in the offlane, as if to prove that he could, in fact, surpass an Ancient 4 player. Watch 9:34 to 16:24 for a good perspective of how this game went. While RedondO managed to prove himself worse than Filski in game 1 (/s), dying twice as much as Filski did , he did far more than I expected out of Doom+Sand King offlane. Anyway, this game was pretty much a crushing blow and there's only so many ways to say [x did good]. Game 2 saw Hitagi do insanely well on Morphling, with RedondO developing dementia or some shit on his Sand King while Joel Warlord pwned newbs on his trademark XxX_WitCh.Doctor_XxX. Alicia did well both games but underwhelms me on this Lina game 2. Solid team, doesn't seem to need as much practice as Melliflox to win games.

## TheJohan

**Current Record: 2-0**

Solaris was apparently replaced by NEAR for this series (with NEAR's team games being currently unavailable) with great results. The double captain strat appears to be so overpowering that even Badger succumbs to its power, going 10-10-13 on Terrorblade. Doom continues to plague RD2L drafts, but this was a less than stellar showing of the hero game 1 before pG got it together to play Beastmaster game 2. Maverick lost mid both games according to Dotabuff, which surely shouldn't happen with Sniper and Razor, and also ended the game with Cheese in his backpack. Nevertheless, he did pretty good on Sniper and slightly less so on Razor. Boneless failed to get more farm than my Nugget Nick but did great on his 4 Night Stalker. I'm unsure of this 27min Eul's into a 41min Force Staff on Nyx, but if it works I can't complain.

Red Says: Besides the absolute nut crushing that was game 2 (signature Badger Alch coming through), game 1 looked kinda close at least until Badger Terrorblade burned Maverick's sniper aegis using reflection only. This false sense of security lured Badger's KC's team out of their base where NEAR could kite them around forever while Maverick was able to pump shot after shot into them.

##Nuttypizza

**Current Record: 2-0**

Classic Ring &gt; Phase &gt; Drums &gt; Yasha &gt; BKB &gt; Aghs build on Gyro here. Anyway, after a bloody toplane the Nutters decided to keep it interesting and decided to completely throw a fight in their jungle at 27 min. Nutty, get out of the offlane if you're going to die 10x on Omniknight and 8x on Tidehunter. Subject continues to slay in the name of his beloved ~~Joel Warlord~~ Witch Doctor player, playing excellent on both Dragon Knigh- *yawn* and Gyrocopter. Lil' Duckie supported Nutty well but failed to stop the bleeding and so Nutty ruleplaced him with Mota, who did slightly better at taming the sacred art of offlane dying. boog-god continues to be a better HippO, playing Earth Spirit both games and managing to secure almost 40 cs in a 40 minute game. Era played Medusa which, since you saw the record of the team above this paragraph, tell you about exactly how game 1 went. Game 2 saw the more-mobile and aggressive Void pickup for Era, causing him to melt when Doomed by "stoned brb" (certainly an odd fate).

Red Says: Game 1 was fairly even, with an edge to Nutty's team being able to defend buildings easily with Dusa and and Jakiro and Yeti's team lacking strong building hitters outside Lina. After forcing a lane of racks and a Monkey King buyback using an aegis and Gyro Aghs NuttyPizza was able to defend the resulting re-push and re-repush back in. When it  looked like Yeti's team was just able to defend this re-re-push they ran outside their  base and was picked off one by one. Game two was not ticketed properly. As part of the Admin's harsh punishments redhq will not comment on any improperly ticketed games.

# Upper Tier

## Skkip

**Current Record: 2-0**

Some fucking old-Melliflox shit here. Dying 4x on Monkey King before 6 minutes, Skkip showed that he might have skipped the "How-to-not-feed-in-the-safelane" class. Respect banning JTK's Techies is probably a good idea, but banning Lich over a more impactful hero? I'm not sure on that one. Brightside lost mid but made a larger game-impact after laning ended, so he's golden boy for game 1. Doom again appears, being piloted by RD2L's most renowned 5 player: Vanilla Acoustic. Apparently learning addition taught him how to go from 5 to 3, but he still managed to support his carries from the 3 role by either tanking enemy spells or by taking damage for his team in game 2 on Abaddon. Tazdude99 lived up to Oh Boy and delivered good things on Warlock, but Skkip managed to sneak into detention at this point and play another game of safelane as Spectre. I think the fact that he did 4.2K building damage on Spectre is enough to say how well game 2 well for his team. For the Thrills played staple 4 heroes and trashed the enemy (minus that pre-6 min event with Monkey).

Red Says: Feeding in the early game is a lot better than feeding in the mid game. Don't believe me? Watch game 1. Skipp died on core MK 4 times in the first 7 minutes. But Badawzer died 4 times between 6 and 12 minutes. Skipp was able to take good fight after good fight leveraging Shea Dr out of the game. Game 2 was a similar blood bath  but Skipp was again sharp on deciding what fights to take and which to dodge, ultimately leveraging them our of a 5k deficit from some early game woes into a win.

## Niffum

**Current Record: 2-0**

JBay7 continues to rival Nugget Nick's Clockwerk and SKarfaze is making other captains look like fools for not picking him earlier. 'Nuff said.

PS. Use your actual names

Red Says: Redhq will also refuse to comment on games where names are indecipherable.

## Zypher

**Current Record: 2-0**

My boy Shmurda still partially almost maybe has it. Undying? Really. I know the boy has like 1.5 arms but I'm pretty sure he can Pudge people even with the hero in its current state. Zypher managed to not lose on Meepo in an official game, so that's something (it was mid Meepo too so it's actually something). Another Doom pickup managed to tame Jeff "Can't Be Tamed" Pest with Izumi &lt;3 stopping Cooper's team of Legendary Archons. [This guy](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/117954023) went full CupOfJoe and played Lich both games, dying only 9 times TOTAL. The 10 min fight here looks impressive, but it was only a sign of what was to come as Zypher's team managed to secure the game slowly and with no major upsets to their gameplan (other than a fight at 25:30 where Meepo and Jugg died). Protip: listen to my boy Shmurda, he knows his shit. Melliflox, Divine 5 furry, will also tell you to listen to Shmurda. Make sure you 5 listens to Shmurda so that they can roam around together and acquire currency to disregard females.

Red Says: Ok so first. Let's have a little discussion Zypher. Some heart to heart if you will. If you like traps, ya gay. At least a little bit. Moving past that and your curbstomp of a game 1, your game 2 looks pretty interesting. In that you took 48 minutes and a throw to close a game against a team with multiple archon players and a venge-only mid player (no offense Zeomaster, you're seriously outperforming your badge). It also it looks like you got outdrafted, so I'll give you that.

## dnm9

**Current Record: 2-0**

Holy shit Prohibit went 16-2 on Kunkka against this team. Anyway, CupOfJoe play Jakiro and managed to get a ton of last hits relative to others in his role. Octane underwhelms me on Doom and Axe, but I can't say he did bad, only that I expected more out of him. hish is apparently playing mid for the team over dnm9, which is an interesting choice but maybe the kiddo is worried that getting roamed on too much will harm his puberty or some shit. Anyway, the guys good. Period. No joke. He might be able to fight Melliflox IRL at this point. dnm9 is the only Prohibit rival this season and I honestly think he can do well but worry that he might face some Malakai-esque issues of doing really well or really poorly at the drop of a hat. Anyway hish is currently busy playing Turbo for Cavern Crawl while debruyne manages to continue to use a Super profile pic despite the series end some time ago. As far as the games go, Prohibit.team continues to struggle to do well alongside Prohibit before Prohibit feels an itch to play a hero that is near-impossible to carry on: Batrider. The fact that Prohibit played Batrider into his biggest "rival" this season should say something: Prohibit is fucking crazy. Now hish did fucking awful laning here (with Prohibit almost doubling his NW at 10 min) yet his team held together and crossed the finish line much faster than Econ's patched-together raft could.

## NEAR

**Current Record: FF-0**

Won via forfeit, gratz kids.

## Xccepted

**Current Record: 1-1**

Dear RedondO, does Timbersaw need a buff?

Jokes aside, Xccepted played Timbersaw and managed to win with it safelane against Tidehunter (unsurprisingly). Xccepted then played an in-meta hero and died [Dark-v-Nugget](https://i.imgur.com/BogHKXo.jpg) style to a roaming Clockwerk. RNGG played only 1 RNG-based hero, so that might be why they los- wait they lost the game he was on the RNG-hero with... hmmmm.... no easy way to explain that. NewbWantBewbsToo role played an Orbital Canon on AA with Y-O-D-A never once dying on Viper, before being ruleplaced by Irissia game 2 (who also played AA). 1/3rd the CS in a longer game isn't too good, maybe take some tips from your Divines on when you can farm so that you can really take over games and have a larger impact than an almost-complete Eul's at 45 min. Akiri played some odd 4 heroes and did okay on Nyx before being served on a plate game 2 as Mirana. I really don't get how they lost game 2, the draft looks okay to me but maybe Clinkz got too big too fast for them to handle.

Red Says: Timbersaw beats strength heroes? Amazing draft in game 1 by Xccepted accompanied by a perfect 16-0-6  game on Y-O-D-A's Viper makes for a rough looking networth graph. In game 2 it looks like Xccepted got the town bicycle treatment, everyone had their turn to kill him at least once, and 4 of Killer Karate's teammates were able to do it at least twice. Getting bodied by McFatSauce's clockwerk looks painful. The game stretched out to the 45 minute mark but it looked totally over at 25 minutes.

# Contender Tier

## Gotard

**Current Record: BYE-BYE**

Holy shit they had the bye. I was worried my team would get it again.

## Vynil

**Current Record: 1-1**

[The game was great as soon as the lobby was made](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442873734009847818/447921102552039424/unknown.png) as this match was the first time I got to face DaywalkeR since being partnered with him last season. The boy whined I'm sure of that, but I have to wonder: did he laugh? Anyway, we ran away with game 1 by taking advantage of the fact that many know of Hotshot's Doom and putting A Flying Monkey on Doom with Hotshot on Clockwerk. The early game went great with my team aggroing into theirs and coming out on top, after which we just partied up with Zeus, took a tower with Shaman wards, then farmed until wards were up again. The game was rather textbook. If you want to see how my team can possibly sometimes maybe function watch our teamfight game 1 at 33:17. Nugget Nick returned to his ~~first pick Sven~~ true role as position 1 with me right there beside him. My boy played an okay Luna before playing a flawed Lifestealer pick (my bad, I'm drafting this season for the first time. The beauty of this is that game 1 had 45 kills in the first 20 minutes. Game 2 was much less exciting. We got rekt. Turns out it's hard to help all 3 lanes with my dated draft of Naga + Disruptor. Oh well, team is going strong. Rubity is a great guy and solid player all around.

Red Says: How you lose to DaywalkeR is beyond me. This series is proof that Axe is a terrible hero. Look at how the Axes did in both games, don't pick Axe.

## Fspoon

**Current Record: 1-1**

Deal with your early game better. Work together instead of these weird fucking dual lanes that struggle to roam well. Also, make sure your players can play the heroes before you pick them. Anyway, DaywalkeR managed to win a game after I did a lackluster draft with poor execution. DaywalkeR remains a top-tier mid on his good days, but he did manage to only tie mid both games despite Rubity being a safelaner. SonOfFiery failed to impress me game 1, playing a mediocre Spectre while [DaywalkeR also went for Physical Ember](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442123060326432768/448019970178154497/unknown.png), which is too slow to slow down the push of Doom, Luna, and Shaman. Son redeemed himself game 2 with an impressive Gyrocopter performance that gave me near-PTSD of the hero. I also learned that DaywalkeR could play Kunkka. Guns4Hands did his job both games, though he did much better on Underlord than on Axe, so that's of note. Fspoon plays Witch Doctor pretty well when he doesn't ban it first phase. Might want to ban The_Punisher's Clockwerk, as he himself stopped Nugget many times game 2. Good job kiddos.

## Colin

**Current Record: 1-1**

Zamolxes. You tried my friend. Sadly Medusa Io is too much for one man to handle. However, I'm not sure mid Omniknight is the way to go? Did Jakou draft this? What happened to cause this pick? Anway, Pingu is a good PL so that's great. Colin did the cancer that is Skywrath in a dual-offlane, dying the least of anyone in game 2. Anyway, fangay himself did okay when put against ruffneck's Axe, but his item timings were slowed heavily by... something. Astroty got respectable timings on items and actually farmed well on Dazzle, showing some good potential for growth and the ability to find good times to farm. Sidenote, get Yerbad out of the offlane and onto the support role. Colin wants to rival Joel Warlord with this Witch Doctor game 1, but fails to follow it up game 2 with a *shocker* second Witch Doctor pick (instead playing Skywrath). Nothing too special here, just two good teams facing each other.

## Killerkarate

**Current Record: 1-1**

Master is DaywalkeR 2.0 confirmed. OH wait he played Safelane game 2? Fuck. I needed a good draft for next season. Anyway, Master's Windranger shows the weakness of the hero after laning phase and low farming potential until she gets a Maelstrom. 14 min Maelstrom into a 21 minute Blink? Something's wrong there. Bottle? Wot. Mate get with the times, Stick + Consumables. Karate did his best Yerbad impression on this Tidehunter, attempting to embody his fellow internet-video-speaker. Guardian_MSSB did fine but I really feel like Rubick + Sand King is a tad too greedy, despite the CK pick. Game 2 saw less draft issues and more absolute destruction in favour of karate's team. Guardian played a mean Lion with a fearsome roar that blew Irissia's AA out of the water, Master toppled Xccepted and Karate got Yergood at Elder Titan.

Red Says: Game 1 looks like Killer Karate got out drafted pretty hard. Additionally it looked they had troubles in even attempting to shut down either Y-O-D-A or Xccepted, the net worth looks pretty sad as a result. Identifying their mistakes from game 1 Killer Karate's team was able to prioritize ganks on the hero that needed to be shut down. Huge clock plays by McFatSauce put's nail after nail into Xccepted's coffin. Eventually the advantage was too large  to surmount and Killer Karate was able to bludgeon out a win.

# Middle Tier

## Nullagon

**Current Record: 1-1**

Role Swap! Nullagon carry failed so now Wise will carry. Scrub Spirit probably did the best he could in the offlane as Windranger (wtf a 44 min Blink) but was outclassed by Pacer's Doom in the enemy offlane. I'm not entirely sure Treads &gt; Hood &gt; Diffusal &gt; Linken's &gt; Manta is the right build here on PL, might be lacking a bit of raw HP and damage. CC-1004 went for the despised Veil build on Death Prophet, which I will never understand as most of DP's damage is physical from her ult and Solar Crest exists in this game (only plausible benefit being the easier-to-stomach buildup). Sylvyr did okay on offlane Axe (for being dual laned with fucking Windranger). Overall... I'm not sure how to fix this. Game 2 was more even. Nullagon supported on Shadow Demon but still lost lane to Sand King + Underlord with his Luna getting some subpar farm by the end of the game but still managing to win the game. I do think that Zeus is a better mid than Lesh right now, as Zeus can spam his spells far more than Lesh before having to clarity it up. CC-1004 does deserve praise here, going 14-0-14 with Sylvyr doing much better with Brewmaster + Windranger.

Red Says: Originally this team name reminded me vaguely of my favorite album (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyYluSPBbc&amp;t=342s) until I realized it was a weak-ass Marble Vigilantes: Forever Fight reference.  Looking at game 1's kill feed, it unsurprisingly looks like axe made unprofitable trade after unprofitable trade (no offence to you Sylvyr, I just think Axe is about as effective as a single mega creep). If they pick literally any other offlaner I think they have a much better matchup and would be able to head out into the mid game without a 10k deficit. Nullagon showed in this game they were able to take profitable fights from behind  but it wasn't enough for only drafting 4 Dota heroes. Game 2 showcased what Nullagon's team looks like on paper to me. Capable of dishing out some convincing 30 minute  stomps.  Beautiful Zeus game, with CC-1004 going 14-0-14 in a sub 30 minute game.

## DARERFANGAY

**Current Record: 1-1**

Good draft game 1 followed up by a less-good draft game 2. They lost to Axe and then won a game from someone forgetting that Ravage doesn't pierce BKB. Anyway, these replays are cancer and showcase some of the most hilarious Dota I've seen in a while (been a while since I spectated Oh Boy's games). Trixcterlad appears to play fine with Poggey, but not quite with the carries. Both supports are dying a ton but not really to the point where I'd say it's particularly bad; they're just playing heroes that HAVE to die or be killed (Venge swaps into death to save and Io is a goal post for Boundless Strikes). Tempest played offlane Veno about 10 patches too late, so that happened. Team's weird yo.

## Dark Smoke

**Current Record: 1-1**

What do I say here other than to know your tempo. Phantom Lancer is not very good early game and is only okay at a VERY specific part of the mid game. Game 2 showcases 5 heroes with little to show for an actual strategy. Mid Nature's is maybe not the most potent thing ever either and it's pretty clear what type of hero Zimimon should be given when you compare his game 1 performance to game 2. SupermaN! failed to overcome the current Axe curse but did do markedly better game 2 than game 1 on Legion Commander into Timbersaw Gyro. Guam lost his citizenship I guess game 2 as he was evicted from any lane and spent wayyy too much time traversing from lane to lane on Vengeful Spirit, likely due to the pressure applied by the other team having a clear tempo. PULLBACKTHEBOLY might not be ready to play Willow yet, but he can certainly play Warlock. I do think that hero is slightly underrated in the current meta. Soul Ring Legion is gross, GTFO (if this is actually common in higher-level Dota, sorry).

Red Says: Losing g1 to a team that both doesn't have a standin for their first pick ancient 5 and contains loves is something is a yikes from me.  But maybe, that's why we're in the below average section of the bracket. In game 2, Loves racked up 12 deaths in a 37 minute game on T I M B E R S A W in bad fight after bad fight, he has literally changed his steam name to "I threw g2" after that series. I'm sorry Dark Smoke, we can't all be winners.

## USSGuam (Alaska or Iwo Jima class?)

**Current Record: 1-1**

I hope you have some PMA Gaming after that first game. 0 minute Wind Lace on Shaman is kinda disgusting to me, as I think Pudge should probably be starting with either Wind Lace or Boots with Shaman playing the poverty-support. 38 minutes with only 21 cs on Shaman? Mate buy some clarities or some shit Christ. Losing mid on Wind to OD. :thinking: Loves appears to be unable to make progress towards victory on Timbersaw, but on Viper safelane? Ohhh boy. Dark taught him nothing but this boy plays mid in the safelane. 30 min Blademail to follow the 16 minute Hurricane Pike. :thinking: This is truly baffling. Anyway, Guam repeatedly sent kiddos to the Embassy on Venge, hopefully not fucking up his Kunkka's combos. I  Want Wind to Blow played an okay Sand King this game alongside... ANOTHER FUCKING WINDRANGER OFFLANE? wtf. I'm done.

Red Says: If any man can tame Loves into a wholesome non-throwy PMA lad, it's the man that raised me from a 2k shitter into a 3k shitter, LS.ibeleive. Unfortunately he's been pretty inactive on dota due to work so we won't be able to see him in action until later in the season. I think that if he can dedicate more time to pubbing with loves both players can make it to divine 0 or 1 by the end of the season and carry their team to playoffs. Until then we're probably going to see middling performances like this one.  Loves going apeshit followed by some Loves™ shotcalling.

## Pacer

**Current Record: 1-1**

Mertank is too good for this league. Going 1-4-28 on Rubick and then making a fantasy league? GTFO. Go help PST-SUN not be a wild west. Potent mid laner aside, this team seems to struggle from a simple lack of cohesion. I do think you field Mertank both games, not just for one. Don't draft Leshrac mid unless you can back it up. GoodVibes appears to of struggle to kill anyone on Troll Warlord, could be that maybe Zeus is too Bursty for him until BKB is up and by then the enemy Luna is an item or two ahead of you due to being unable to kill. 22 min BF? WTF. You're a ranged/melee hero, Underlord shouldn't be THAT oppressive against you. Anyway, Jakiro is a fine pick but did only 73 tower damage, so that's an issue. This team might crumble to gatekeeper teams and make it just shy of playoffs.

# Lower Tier

## Raul

**Current Record: 0-2**

Red Says: Oof, ouch, owie, curbstomp hurting juice. Game 1 looks painful, the dotabuff kill feed paints a picture of failed rotations and lost team fights on the side of Raul. Eventually they lost by being unable to kill more than bane in teamfights as their base crumbled  around them. Game 2 was much more exciting as they were able to win a pivotal fight around the rosh pit with some insane plays by both Kongo Schlong's Shadow Shaman and their tusk player. Unfortunately they weren't able to capitalize  on it well enough even though they got the tier 2 tower mid. They retreated back into rosh and logical's QoP snatched the Aegis out  from under them enabled  by some absolutely fantastic shot calling on the side of logical. This unfortunately was the last hope Raul's team had in this series.

## Shea Dr.

**Current Record: 0-2**

After a rocky start to his safelane shenanigans, Shea has returned to the offlane. His first game put him in a rouch Gyrocopter game. Lord Muffin played a mean Invoker but it wasn't enough to save JTK from the banning of Techies. Now I'm no expert, but maybe safelane Kunkka carry isn't the most effective draft around, especially for a man of JTK's skillset. Poxie did fine on Witch Doctor game 2, especially when you factor in the fact that Skkip is Melliflox-tier and played Spectre. Arok did interesting things on Spirit Breaker but nothing anyone did in either of these games appears to of gone as planned. Anyway, 25 min glimmer on poverty-Witch is a good timing to me.

## PaprikaCC

**Current Record: 0-2**

Call the fucking cops. There's been a murder. This team got fcuking slaughtered game 1. CosmiK, as brilliant as that boy is, wasn't enough to prevent Mikel from rampaging all over. Game 2 is more crushing, because they had it. They fucking had it. But they blew it. 3 five man wipes will disintegrate any 12K gold lead, but continuing to trade poorly after that? That's just the sign that you have 100% fucked. up.

Red Says: Paprika, I know you weren't there for your team as a battle brother but I know you were there in spirit. But it's okay. There is no shame in losing to Mikel. ~~Vynil won't let me put you higher in the rankings even though you gave one of the best teams in the league a run for their money.~~ [REDACTED] Game 1 was rough, but european overlords are hard to kill.  Game 2  was closer but it looks like you overcommitted to mikel woo many times

HullCity07 got played like an absolute violin game 1, though Omni Zeus makes taking any duel rather risky. derp appears to of played a bit too safe on Lion, making near 0 impact despite his Blink Dagger pickup. B.O.D.M.A.S had a rough Viper game into Longoria (who I'm surprised isn't Divine yet). W33333333 even struggled against Filski's Brew on Morphling, going a 1-3-3 build that didn't quite pan out after he was near-abandoned in the bottom lane. Game 2 shows that Melliflox knows that Lycan isn't dead yet, picking up his infamous hero into W33333333's Medusa and Kuro's PL. HullCity attempted to become Subject with this Pango pickup but it was to no avail, as Melliflox is a potent offlaner with supports that can listen to his wise council of "go now, go now."

## Cloudy

**Current Record: 0-2**

Shoutout to Iceyeti for this Monkey King performance. The team did solidly, they just ran out of time. Medusa + Omni is a good way to halt a Monkey King from doing anything in a large teamfight. The best I can say here is that game 1 was back and forth, and that's a good thing here. They made a real effort and almost made it work. Good job all of you, keep going. Work up the rankings.

# Teams? Or A Group of Players?

Prohibit, what are these heroes? If this team can figure out how to work together they might just win something, but as long as they continue to bleed their morale dry they'll continue to lose. Good players with bad teamwork.

## Cooper

Ask for coaching, watch replays. Play safe heroes. Don't disband. It'll be good for each of you to grow from this. I rose 5 badges after last season, I'm sure each of you can do the same if you work hard enough. I believe you can do better than Divine 5 Malakai's team last season.

## Phase

**Current Record: 0-2**

You gotta stop Hitagi. I also don't think you given Donger Razor. Ever. This guy plays better lane-winners than fucking Razor. Phase did an okay Wind game 2? not much to say here. No flame to give out as they lost to one of the best teams and no one person even really did THAT poorly. Sucks but you have to move on and win next week.

# Starboy's Dumpster

**Current Record: DISBAND WEEK 1**

You're in here for the whole season, not even sure if it's your fault but what ever happened in this team is unacceptable.

The beginning of an autistic homebrew epic Long time lurker first time poster.
Let me start by saying.

When I say homebrew, I mean homebrew, like really really really homebrew. Like I don't even have the game, I just know the rules and we roll the dice and play in an online chat room. Best think about this tho is that no spell preparation is required, just cast and roll a chance dice to see if you succeed. Still fun tho, and I don't care what you say but this is the best story ever.

&gt; Be me, first time Dm

&gt;Be not me, Setra the Skelly Wizard, Kazriel the Black Half Elf, and Darius the Warlock

&gt; Midgard is under siege by the Demon King
&gt; Demon King kidnapped Kings daughter
&gt; All the magor heroes are dead
&gt; Resort to drafting fugitives
&gt; Setra, accused of treason, Kazriel accused of  stealing, and Darius, accused of witchcraft, are all set free and summoned by the King

&gt; King tells them the situation and the fact that they are midgards last defence
&gt; King, a former wizard, gives each of the fugitives a blessing of their choosing
&gt; Skelly asks for immortality
&gt; King can't do that but he can lock his soul in a little blue orb that will function as a heart for him. He can't die unless the orb is destroyed
&gt; Assassin asked for the ability to call upon any weapon of his choosing and materialize it in his hand
&gt; Warlock just wants his invitations to do more damage

&gt; Embark on the mission

&gt; Kazriel decides to go to his hometown in the Violet Grove Mountains for clothes and money, also to see his family
&gt; Others think it's a good idea and join

&gt; Group gets hungry
&gt; Warlock can't take the hunger
&gt; Eats some shroomies off the side if the path

&gt; Gets poisoned and falls prone for the next whole day
&gt; Ground starts shaking
&gt; Sound of stones grinding

&gt; It's a golem

&gt; Setra casts tremor
&gt; Golem loses footing
&gt; Starts falling in the direction of the prone warlock
&gt; Assassin rushes in and saves him
&gt; Summons daggers and attacks
&gt; Minimal damage
&gt; Wizard casts tremor again
&gt; Golem is prone
&gt; Assassin summons great hammer
&gt; Nat 20
&gt; Smashes his head clean off

&gt; Assassin wants too see dad
&gt; "Where is dad?'
&gt; Mother starts crying
&gt; Assassin starts crying
&gt; Setra and Darius take the money and go to a nearby tavern
&gt; They spot a mission for the eradication or the golem
&gt; 500 gold reward
&gt; The death list as a result of the golems rampage includes the assassins dad

&gt; Down to 500 gold
&gt; He waits for the drunks to wake

&gt; Assassins player looks at me and says "You're an evil Dm"
&gt; You have no idea
&gt; I will kill my players off in the blink of an eye

&gt; Drunk duo awakens
&gt; Wizard player hands me a note
&gt; Give him my nod if approval
&gt; Assassin: We need weapons, armour, and more money
&gt; Wizard: I have a palace

Advancing past F40/42 I feel ready and am at this very moment about to hit "X" and advance to the next area.

Running dual RE DBBS's, RE Clayhead, WOT NR Chest and WS legs with a 1 day pass allowing me to take a invincshroom and return to waiting room shroom.

I've been skimming through as little info as possible as to not ruin the experience, however I'm aware it isn't anything new so to speak, just another 10+ floors reshuffled with the addition of screamers being replaced by hunters so on.

I will no doubt be reading a bunch of info after my first run to help me prepare for the coming 50+ floors, anyone able give advice on what might help me better prepare or faster ready myself for those coming floors would be greatly appreciated.

Will update on how my first run goes as soon as I'm safely in the waiting room...it begins!

Kohler M8 governor and springs - anyone have this engine? Hi all. I have an old Kohler M8 on a BCS walk behind tractor. Got it running great now with the exception of RPM being too low at WOT. I think I may be missing some springs or something else is off (this machine has had multiple owners and has been messed with in past). It was missing at least one spring and the throttle linkages would not return when throttle lever was let off. I added a spring I had lying around (could be too much tension or not enough but it does return throttle linkages now)

This is what it looks like: https://imgur.com/a/VAF2zBL

Behind the governor arm is a round plate with different holes in it. Appears that you can make adjustments by moving the lower throttle linkage rod to different holes. Havent tried that yet (because it does not seem straight forward to do, have to remove a lot of things)

Any help greatly appreciated

1980 Honda CM200T Carb Adjustment Rabbit Hole--left cylinder no longer firing I decided to finally take the carb off of my 1980 Honda CM200T Twinstar today because of bogging/sputtering when 3/4 - WOT.

I managed to get the bike running pretty good after replacing the main jet, but it wasn’t 100% so I lowered the needle clip and adjusted the float level and then things got bad…

The left cylinder stopped firing, but the right side fired perfectly fine. I took out the plugs and the LEFT PLUG - BLACK and WET with gas and RIGHT PLUG - BROWN/WHITE and DRY.

I switched the plug wires and the misfiring did not transfer

I removed the left plug and plugged the left plug hole with my thumb while turning it over and there was significant pressure against my thumb.

A farmer named paddy A farmer named Paddy had a car accident. He was hit by a truck owned by the Eversweet Company.

In court, the Eversweet Company's hot-shot solicitor was questioning Paddy.  “'Didn't you say to the
police at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine?'” asked the solicitor.

Paddy responded, “Well, I'll tell you what happened.  I'd just loaded my fav'rit cow, Bessie, into da... “

“I didn't ask for any details”, the solicitor interrupted.  “Just answer the question.  Did you not say,
at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?'”

Paddy said, “Well, I'd just got Bessie into da trailer and I was drivin' down da road.... “

The solicitor interrupted again and said, ”Your Honour, I am trying to establish the fact that at the scene
of the accident this man told the police that he was fine.  Now several weeks after the accident, he is
trying to sue my client.  I believe he is a fraud.  Please tell him to simply answer the question. “

By this time, the judge was fairly interested in Paddy's answer and said to the solicitor, “I'd like to hear what
he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie.”

Paddy thanked the judge and proceeded.  “Well, as I was sayin’, I had just loaded Bessie, my fav'rit cow, into
de trailer and was drivin' her down de road when this huge Eversweet truck and trailer came tundering tru a stop
sign and hit me trailer right in da side.  I was trown into one ditch and Bessie was trown into da udder.  By Jaysus,
I was hurt, very bad like, and didn't want to move.  However, I could hear old Bessie moanin' and groanin’.  I knew
she was in terrible pain just by her groans.”

“Shortly after da accident, a policeman on a motorbike turned up.  He could hear Bessie moanin' and groanin' too,
so he went over to her.  After he looked at her and saw her condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.”

“Den da policeman came across de road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, 'How are you feelin'?'  Now, wot
da fock would you say?”

how much oil can the cas leak? So I had both an oil and coolant leak a while back but no signs of head gasket failure. I changed my timing belt and did every seal and part while in there, so now my coolant has been rock solid for the past 5 weeks or so but my oil is still dissapearing somewhere quickly.

I'm going through about 0.5L/0.44 quarts each week, doing like 200 miles max.

I know my cas o ring is leaking, if I run my finger under it is coated in oil. I didn't want to do it at the same time as timing belt incase I messed up the timing through the cas.

My question Is, how much oil can leak out the cas?

There's a bit of black smoke (not blue) on the overrun after WOT.

FA50 kit trouble shooting. I recently put the 45mm K-star kit on my 1980 FA50. I followed the break-in guide from moped army sans doing plug chops (I don’t have access to my garage for a few weeks because of sewer work and such).

Last night was my first longer ride post break-in.  I’m still babying it and not trying to push to WOT. After about 3 miles at 30mph, I had a soft seize. Let it sit for about 5 min, fired back up and rode the last 5 miles home doing various RPMs (throttle, coast, etc. have some stop lights) with no problem.

I’ve upjetted stock carb from 77.5 to 82.5. I have a MLM side bleed, malossi red springs, boysen power reeds, hi pass airfilter.

Just looking for recommendations and such.

Thanks!

Single-pull (non-push) throttle? I just reinstalled my FCR39 MX (pro-tip: shit  was way harder than it should have been), and when I put my throttle cable in, I noticed that the throttle did two weird things:

1) It returned very, very slowly... which would result in death on the street...

2) I turned it once to WOT and the throttle tube sort of clicked and just at there and didn't return at all. Which would result in death on the street...

#2 was really the more confusing one, as the FCR39's throttle is spring-loaded, and it's a powerful spring at that. How it didn't pull the throttle tube back to zero is beyond me, but I assumed that the cables at the throttle body needed their screws adjusted a bit and that would fix it.

It's a push/pull Motion Pro, and I have an identical replacement, so I was going to replace it and I thought, you know what? Fuck this push/pull setup. The push cable literally doesn't do anything but get in the way, and I could run with just the pull cable - the carb itself should pull the throttle back to zero with just it's spring by nature of design.

Is anyone out there running a single pull setup? I did some googling and a lot of the information is outdated and points you to places that are now considered ill-advised like SSW. I figure if I can find the proper single-pull throttle, I may even just be able to use my old (or the new) pull cable, so I won't have to find or make one.

Any ideas?

Replaced battery but phone not charging now So i had the usual issue with the battery coming to the end of its life in the phone, dieing 30 secs off charge, and it was spending its whole time wired up to an external battery pack!

So i decided it was time to attempt a battery replacement myself, coupled with a screen replacement, as i had cracked the screen and figured it would need replacing anyway when i got it unsealed from the phone.

I ordered the parts of ebay, from shops that seemed to have good reviews. and after some fuff with them sending me the wrong items, i eventually got what i ordered....

_______________

First concern i came across was that the new replacement battery wasn't quite the same as the one i took out of the phone. The tape was slightly different, and had been applied in a slightly different way, dispute all the stickers on the replacement indicating that this was indeed a HTC10 battery. I decided to proceed anyway and put the variance down to different batches or something, Put the phone back together again, carefully re-inserting all the ribbon cables, and applying new electrical tape in the same way it was before.

The Phone powered back on, new screen was great, and all seemed hunky-dory!

Issues arrised though when i attempted to recharge the phone. I plugged in my HTC10 official wall plug, and HTC10 official usb cable, and the phone started to rapidly charge for about 2 mins... It then stopped charging, got incredibly hot and all of a sudden started to give off that burnt electrical smell...

After a brief panic, where i put the phone in fire place, as i expected imminent destruction, i disassembled my phone again where everything inside looked fine, no burn marks, no nothing, except the burnt electrical smell coming from the USB port inside the phone.

Phone doesn't charge now. Not quite sure if i call it quits here and get a new phone, or order a new battery and USB board for the inside of the phone and hope that cues my phone.

Also, when i took the original battery out, it got badly bent due too the adhesive they use inside, so i dont want to put that back in to test which component really is kak.

______________________

**TL:DR** - Replaced battery and screen. Burnt smell from phone on recharge attempt, and phone wont charge now. On disassembly pt2, phone internals look fine, but smell of burnt present on internal USB port. Wot do?

Not so fun fuel issue. any ideas? Hi all, we've got a fuel delivery issue going on that we would love some extra brain power on, maybe someone with a fresh mind to this will think of something we haven't. The car is a 1990 s5 na fc. We had issues with the car fuel starving when the throttle was depressed to more than about 30-40%. We did a lot of searching, and figured out that the relay/resistor combo that keeps the fuel pump at 9V during low load, and lets the pump receive full battery voltage under high load wasn't working. The system was only getting 9V no matter how much you were in the throttle. So we replaced the whole relay/resistor assembly, and unplugged the ecu to reset everything, then plugged it in and tried it out. At a standstill, revving the car got the fuel pump up to 14V like its supposed to. HOWEVER (because of course that cant be the end of it), after driving about 500 feet, (through first gear @ WOT, and halfway through second), the problem starts to happen again. fuel pump only gets 9V, car throws about 4 CEL codes. Most codes are nothing major, o2 sensor, some intake solenoid that isnt necessary, most notably it throws a CAS code, but I imagine thats because the computer knows that its fuel starving like crazy.

So we limp it back around the block, and swap over to the spare ecu for the car to be 100% sure its not the computer messing up, and the issue repeats itself. Car runs fine in neutral, at a standstill. It can make it down the driveway, all the way through first gear, and halfway through second and the same problems start.

Anyone on here ever experienced anything like this? this weekend i'm going to be going back and triple checking all grounds and wiring (reading up on the whole wiring diagram right now), but I'm really at a loss as to what could be the problem at this point. Obviously the computer tells the relay when the throttle passes a certain point so that it can bypass the resistor and give the fuel pump full voltage, but i'm not sure what tells the computer. Surely the ecu would be making that judgment from the reading its receiving from the tps, and thats been calibrated, replaced, calibrated again and looked over a dozen times without finding any abnormalities.

Any and all help or advice in figuring this issue out is greatly appreciated

Car runs fine in neutral, at a standstill. It can make it down the driveway, all the way through first gear, and halfway through second and the same problems start.

Anyone on here ever experienced anything like this? this weekend i'm going to be going back and triple checking all grounds and wiring (reading up on the whole wiring diagram right now), but I'm really at a loss as to what could be the problem at this point. Obviously the computer tells the relay when the throttle passes a certain point so that it can bypass the resistor and give the fuel pump full voltage, but i'm not sure what tells the computer. Surely the ecu would be making that judgment from the reading its receiving from the tps, and thats been calibrated, replaced, calibrated again and looked over a dozen times without finding any abnormalities.

Any and all help or advice in figuring this issue out is greatly appreciated

'Twas the Night before PT Dominaria 'Twas the night before PTDom and all through each House
Not a team could practice ‘cause Mit-Go was down
Chainwhirlers were sleeved up in red decks with care
While Lyras awaited to attack through the air

Coverage began with a BenS draft featured
He crafted an A+ with 17 creatures
He slammed down a “Dub” and proudly proclaimed
“I’m so glad I woke up, though start times are lame”

As 3-0s were building towards this year’s Draft Master
Twitch chat kept demanding rounds should go faster
It was finally time for a new format, Standard
Cause Wot-cee must sell packs and Brawl must be pandered

We listened to Marshall and admired Riley’s hair
As they both kept on saying, “let’s go down to the feature match area”
"It’s Teferi control, what a surprise!”
As +1s and tucks kept winning all ties

On Sunday we’re graced with LSV’s banter
Cause he’s "unlucky", and lost round 15 with a no-lander
Those comments so awesome, so classic, like vinyl
From Top 8 to Top 2 and then a 5-game Final

On the back of an unsung, Squee UR Wizards, no less!
A winner emerges past Mono Black stress
The victor holds their trophy up to the light
Bolas Clutches for all, and to all a good night!

Not detecting ethernet cords/missing drives Hey everyone!

So I've been using my desktop for a while now using a USB wireless dongle (don't have a PCIe card) or a ethernet cable to connect to the wifi. I bought a kitten yesterday so I turned off everything at the wall. Upon restarting my PC my connections (having to describe as it won't let me post pictures) is not showing any available networks. Instead a computer with the connection and a red cross.

I have tried restarting, hard reset, draining CMOS bsttery, uninstalling Intel ethernet driver and restarting to reinstall, changing some Plex thing in the driver properties, made sure everything was enabled in device manager, reset TCP/IP and in network connections&gt;properties it says they are working fine.

I finally tried reinstalling windows overnight and it didn't fix it, now I'm missing my HDD and it's not showing in disk management. I'm a student and can't afford to take it to a shop. Wot do

Thanks guys :)

(Not a issue with the ethernet cord either)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;During Matlovich's September 1975 administrative discharge hearing, an Air Force attorney asked him if he would sign a document pledging to "never practice homosexuality again" in exchange for being allowed to remain in the Air Force. Matlovich refused.
&gt;
&gt;I'm surprised he didn't accept to it to make it all go away.
&gt;
&gt;If he would have accepted it, he may not have had to deal with this :
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In 1986, Matlovich felt fatigued, then contracted a prolonged chest cold he seemed unable to shake. When he finally saw a physician in September of that year, he was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.
&gt;
&gt;I know it's commendable to stand up for what you think is right at the time, but there is a slimmer of a chance that he wouldn't have had HIV if he would have simply agreed to the document.

&gt;King is a left wing shill unfortunately. So many of his stories are liberal propaganda it takes away from his gifts as a writer.
&gt;
&gt;His entire Under The Dome book reads like an infomercial for the theory of global warming. It's pseudoscience mixed with a clear radical agenda
&gt;
&gt;His books were better before he became so political
&gt;
&gt;Edit - what's with the downvotes? King rallies for Democrats and does fundraising for them. He is exactly as I portray him. Please stop ruining my karma just because the Reddit hivemind is aligned with the radical left

[Breeds] first dog, living in San Francisco \*\*Introduction\*\*

1\)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No, both my partner and I had dogs growing up but this will be our first adult dog that we have been solely responsible for. My partner has no experience with dog training. I attended a few training sessions as a child and teen and I feel fairly comfortable 'communicating' with dogs but would say I'm far from an expert.

2\)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]\( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying\-reputable\-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)\)?

\* I think I've been scared away from rescuing. I've just had bad experiences. My sister has a dog she rescued and it has quite a bit of behavioral issues, which I attribute to early trauma. Growing up, we adopted a young dog that seemed mellow and sweet and turned into a totally different personality shortly after getting home. We're attracted to a reputable breeder but we place the emphasis on reputable and responsible.

3\)  Describe your ideal dog.

\* Friendly, calm, cuddly, and capable of being sporty but not hyper. We'd want a dog to cuddle up with as we read or watch a movie. We also want to be able to go hiking and camping with our dog. We live in an apartment so the dog would need to be on the smaller size.

4\)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* We're looking at the Portuguese Water Dog. I've heard good things about poodles, however, we're not entirely attracted to the esthetic. Maybe our minds could be changed but the poodles I've known just don't seem cuddly enough. Neither of us are allergic but my girlfriend/partner sheds enough herself and I'm not sure we want too much more hair around the apartment. I've seen so much negativity around doodles here so I say this with caution, we're also attracted to the Bernadoodle \(mini\), in particular, from the breeder Swissridge who appears to be reputable and responsible. Has anyone had any experience with this breeder?

5\)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* We would like the dog to be able to be certified to go on an airplane with us as a service animal. We want the dog to be obedient and responsive to basic commands. When a new visitor comes, we want to be able to say "sit, stay" and have the dog stay until we release. Ideally we can walk without leash but that's not a must \(given laws in our area\).

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

  6\) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Aside from walks we could easily spend an hour or two a week on training, etc. Usually spend the evenings at home during the week.

7\) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* We look forward to having the commitment to come home to. We both work but we could easily do a 15\-30 min walk morning and evening during the week. We can also work from home one to two days per week. On the weekends we look forward to an hour or two of play in the park or a trip out of the city.

8\)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* We're open to some maintenance but don't want a particularly high maintenance dog. We would probably pay for professional grooming and in between do more minor stuff ourselves. I don't look forward to brushing. Thankfully, my partner looks forward to it quite a bit. I think two brushings per week is very doable. Not sure how long the weekly tasks take TBH.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

9\)  What size dog are you looking for?

\* We're looking for a dog on the smaller end of medium. Maybe around 24 inches and 50 lbs would be on the high end as far as weight.

10\) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* A little shedding is fine but we don't want a ton. We can deal with a little barking, say when someone comes to the door but we don't want an incessant yapper. Finally, we really want to minimize slobber. My mom's male golden is always ruining my T\-shirts and pants with his affection.

11\) How important is being able to let your dog off\-leash in an unfenced area?

\* It would be nice but is not essential.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

12\) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* We'd like a snuggly dog.

13\) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager\-to\-please?

\* We don't need a dog that is desperate for love but eager\-to\-please sounds right. We want a pet that is looking for direction. I suppose a dog somewhere in the middle between the two.

14\) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* We want the dog to be friendly with strangers and other dogs but not jumping all over them. As I mentioned, a bit of barking is fine but we don't want the dog to forget all about us when there is a visitor. Possibly a little more reserved than a lab or golden.

15\) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No.

16\) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Neurotic. We had an Australian shepherd growing up who had a lot of the traits that I like but she was just so protective of food and often gave off the impression she was worried about something.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

17\) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* We work during the day. So 9 hours of alone\-time for the dog would be fairly common. Since we can work from home part of the week and sometimes bring the dog wot work, it wouldn't be every day but realistically, the dog would have some days alone.

18\) What are the dog\-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* We have one roommate who is excited about the prospect. We have a number of friends who have offered to take care of the dog when we're out of town.

19\) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* We're not planning to have any other pets anytime soon. We will bring the dog down to my parents where there are two Golden Retrievers and sometimes my sister's Pitbull. The other dogs are sometimes a bit on the less well behaved side but still manageable.

20\) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* Not for the next couple years. However, in the dog's lifetime we will likely have children.

21\) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* We rent an apartment. It's about 1,100 sqft but hope to move into a home with a small yard in the next few years. The apartment allows pets. There might be a large dog restriction but I can't recall.

22\) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* We live in San Francisco. We may move to Southern California at some point.

23\) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* It's very moderate. I'd say the hottest it gets is about 85 deg in the city or 100 deg outside the city. The coldest it gets is about 38 deg here in the city. We do hope to be able to take the dog up to the mountains. We both love skiing and some compatibility with snow would be wonderful.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

24\) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* We're so excited to be getting our first adult dog! We are a bit fearful, though, of purebred health concerns.

25\) Feel free to ask any questions below.

\* If we were to go through a rescue, what's the best way to minimize the likelihood of trauma or health issues? If you recommend a certain breed could you help recommend a breeder, if you know one?

Decided on Thermal exhaust, incredibly pleased Finally got around to my first real upgrade with a Thermal R&amp;D catback, purchased from Ron @ Whoosh who got my order out incredibly quickly. I was on the fence whether to get the MBRP, CP-E, or Thermal catback, and I couldn't be happier with the quality and sound of the Thermal. There is virtually no drone whatsoever, except for around 2200-2400 rpm, but even that is a very low hum that you don't have to raise your voice over. Cruising at 70-80 sounds similar to stock, and WOT sounds absolutely glorious. I was also happily surprised by the burbles and seldom pops while off throttle, even with my stock downpipe. The pops aren't frequent, but I seem to get 1-2 per 100 miles in mixed city/highway. Stock intake, stock intercooler, stock intercooler piping, stock downpipe, no accessport/tune, and a WC Lathe Werks shift knob (also super satisfied with).

[Letter] U FACKIN WOT M8 "Please, ser, you must calm yourself!" the Maester insisted, holding tightly against his chest a bundle of parchments which had arrived earlier that morning and he hadn't yet had time to put away before 'Wild' Wyl Waynwood came barging into the rookery shouting for this and that.

"The fuckin' letters, Maester!" he roared, looking back at the letter clutched tightly in his hand with rage, "Corbray and Redfort- KIN!" he bellowed, shaking with fury, unable to do anything in the moment but stare bullets through the thin, yellow parchment before bursting into another torrent of curses and profanity.

The Maester nodded and toddled humbly and hustled to and fro to exact from the rookery the required affects, setting aside the bundle of new parchment and drawing one crisp sheet from the stack.  *Nothing like fresh parchment,* he reminded himself with a satisfied smile, setting the sheet in place and dipping the quill in the inkfont.  "Ser, when you are ready..."

Wyl nodded twice, firstly to assure the Maester and the second for his own good self.  *Right, right,* he nodded, organizing his thoughts, thinking of how to start off the letter.  "How's it been, ye old bag o' bones?"

*Lord Qyle Corbray,*

"I 'eard from Terry there was trouble abound.  I'll be seeing you soon."

*I have heard only rumors of recent troubles.  I shall ride at haste to meet you at Heart's Home, that there may be some light shed on the topic.*

"And...?" the Maester trailed, waiting for whatever profane signing-off the Knight intended.

"An' fook off," Wyl gave the Maester a heady smile which disappeared as soon as he turned, slamming the door behind him with a frightening boom.

The Maester hummed a bit, looking at the letter and tapping the top of the quill to his lower lip as he thought how to resolve it.

*Sincerely,*

*Ser Wyl Waynwood*

---

The letter would read, in full:

&gt; Lord Qyle Corbray,
&gt;
&gt; I have heard only rumors of recent troubles.  I shall ride at haste to meet you at Heart's Home, that there may be some light shed on the topic.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;

How many days did you give yourself for testing out a technique until you realized that the technique was bullshit and you need a new technique? I've tried MILD-doesn't work, WILD-of course it never worked, SSILD-never worked, simple intention-that's just rubbing salt to the wound now, WBTB-doesn't work, Sigil-wot?, Forgetting about it and coming back again-this is a technique?, counting fingers-I still see 10, Reality checks and dream journaling-was this supposed to work?, self hypnosis- tried that six years ago, don't even know if I'm a beginner or a whiner. DILD/DEILD-you need to be already useful enough for that, law of attraction- yes I went that far, meditation-you already know the answer. I feel like I'm becoming one of those people who will 6 months from now, post about how lucid dreaming is simply not working for them. This month was supposed to be it. This month I had 30 days off for vacation, most sleep the entire year. I just wasted those 30 days not being lucid. I just wasted those days sleeping trying everything and achieving absolutely nothing. I will give myself just 2 more months of trying, if I'm successful then bless you and if it doesn't...I'll just forget that lucid dreaming even exists and go back to real life.

Which technique honestly worked for you and what made you realize that you need to spend more days on this promising technique?

I want to make Kratom chew. Wot u think m8? I have a dream of making some kind of palatable Kratom chew from the powder I bought.
I wonder if I can mix the powder with like molasses or oil or something or cook it into some kind of paste.

Then instead of swallowing down disgusting powder I can just enjoy a slow chew.

I've never chewed tobbaco before but I imagine they put a bunch of crap in there in order to make it more delicious and "resin like". That's what I'm going for.

I wonder what would be some good binding agents so that I'm not chewing on powder which gets all over the mouth and makes you want to drink bleach.

Anyways it's a well known fact that absorbing the Kratom chemicals through the walls of your mouth is much more effective than through the stomach and intestines.

I think the Kratom itself doesn't taste that bad.. it's more just the fact that your eating this dry powder, like the cinnamon challenge, it just kills me especially when I try to down it quick then my tongue rises up when I swallow and the shit goes in my nasal cavity.

So yeah Kratom chew. Discuss.

Update: JNFMIL and the carseat fiasco Holy shit you guys! This literally just happened so I apologise in advance of I ramble but my nerves are shot to hell right now, on mobile too yadda yadda.

Our good friend, BB, can fill you in on the backstory from my first post here, I'm sure.

So, OH has been VLC while I've been NC with his mother for a few weeks now, simply loving the peace and focusing on our bub who is due in 4 weeks. Until tonight.

We knew that SIL was due to come round but we made it clear a few days ago for her to not bring their mother with her. Who should be at the door when OH answered but his mother?!

First words out of her mouth were "I know I'm not welcome so I'm not staying long."
Then why show up at all?!
OH slammed the door in her face.
God, I wish he hadn't opened it again but it's cold out and God forbid we give her another excuse to play woe is me so, he let her in.

It was my eldest birthday yesterday and she'd brought a present along for her and asked me if she could give it to her.

Me: "that'd be great since she didn't even get a phone call from any of you yesterday."

Her: "But my phone wasn't working and I wasn't feeling well and last time I called you, you yelled at me!"
...all said in one breath with the last part being an outright lie. Our last phone call ended with her deludedly (?) saying "oh I'm so glad we're talking again." Wot?!

This was the start of 2 hours of her literally stomping her feet, screaming at me, twisting mine and OHs words and crying. It annoyed her to no end that the more childish she became the more calm yet snarky my remarks became. I told her she was being petulant...cue more crying and telling me to get off my high horse.

From her end it was all "I didn't intend for you to feel that way"
It seemed to escape her that intentions dont count for shit when your resulting actions contradict them.

I repeated multiple times "I dont care about what your intentions were, simply what actually happened and how to solve it! So, you're either here to offer a solution or you're just here to argue. Which is it?!"


Amongst all her screaming like a banshee she almost apologised for upsetting me...
"I'm sorry I upset you but you're wrong too!"
umm that's not an apology in my books

When these tactics didn't work and she realised I wasn't pandering to her tantrums about current issues she decided it'd be smart to not only bring up an argument from xmas 3 years ago (another story for another time) but to attack my family, who are very just yes and have zero to do with her, in the process. Not a smart idea.

Before long, she was in tears over me telling her to grow up. She had asked for a mature conversation and that certainly wasn't happening. I have more mature arguments with my 5yr old ffs.

Everytime logic defeated her or she was called on her contradictions, the tears would start again and it was the constant same....

Her: storms out of the house and grabs her chest.
Me: "calm down and just take a breath. You keep getting yourself all worked up when you're the one who asked for a 'nice' talk."
Her: "DONT TELL ME HOW TO CALM DOWN! IM CRYING BECAUSE IT IS STRESS RELIEF!"
Ok...stress relief till you put yourself in hospital and blame me for it, right?

Now, my OH is completely over this mess. Hes been victim to his mothers pettiness his whole life and is at the end of his tether with it. To his credit, he had my back and more than once told his mum to leave rather than scream at his heavily pregnant girlfriend. She also totally disregarded the fact I had just put my sick 5yr old to bed but that's neither here nor there.

By this time I had tried to remove myself from the situation but of course that meant her target HAD to be followed.

It ended with me telling her it wasn't just about the car seat issue, it was a plethora of issues, the main one being that she got herself involved in something that had zero to do with her. Her children are all adults and dont need mummy fighting their fights for them.

Her: "But they're my faaamily and MY children so I'll handle them how I want. I was just defending my daughter!"
Me: "Well OH is my family now and I wont have you disrespecting him! Your whole argument is sick, lady! You were defending your daughter at the expense of your son when you had no place getting involved at all! Absolutely sick! I, for one, have zero obligation to tell you anything about myself or baby when shes born so dont expect updates after this bullshit."

And with that we shut the door on her crazy arse crying that we had won (doesnt feel like a win to me) and I can finally let the frustrated tears fall.

I dont know what I hope to achieve from this or where this leaves us except on further NC and I'm sure I've left out details but I'm grateful you're all here for me to vent to so, thank you. It's nice to know I'm not alone in the crazy Inlaw department.

It's that time of year where all your windows are open &amp; you overhear everything people shout in the street...! I just arrived back at my flat after a week away, so went rushing round to open the windows to get some air flowing though it. First thing I hear when I open the living room window??

"Oi! Guess wot I ain't dun in ages?? Whacked me fanny on that!!!"

She never elaborated on what 'that' actually was...! Anyone else heard anything ridiculous when people don't realise you're listening through your windows?

[OR IZ DER?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN25ghkfgQA)

DA HUMIEZ ONCE USED WOT THEY CALL "SPEERZ", DEY'RE POINTY CHOPPAHS THAT YOU FRAST GITZ WITH EM AND KRUMP 'EM. WOT MAKEZ EM GUD (FOR THEM) IZ DAT DA RANGE OF THE CHOPPAHS ARE PRETTY LONG DAT YOU CAN SAFELY KRUMP GITZ FROM A GOOD DISTANCE BUT DAT MAKES YE A COWARD. INTERESTIN' CONCEPT OF A CHOPPAH DOE.

FROM ME TEST RESULTZ, AN AVERAGE ELDAR EAR CAN CUT THROUGH GARDSMAN FLAK ARMOR LIKE PAYPER, IT CAN CUT DEEP ENOUGH IN A SPOICE MARINE ARMOR AND IT CAN CUT THROUGH A TERMINATAH ARMOR THO IT STRUGGLEZ A BIT WIT DAT. ANOTHER GREAT RESULT IS DAT DA BANSHEES HAVE DERY POINTY 'EADS AND SEEMZ TO 'AVE MORE PUNKTURE POTENTIAL. DEY MAY BE GREAT POINTY CHOPPAHS, BUT IT'Z RISKY TO GET A BANSHEE SINCE DEY QUITE GOOD AT KRUMPIN' BUT IF YA DO, YOU MIGHT HAVE A PRETTY NIFTY CHOPPAH.

I am Socrates and this is the story of how I outsmarted a melon salesman  \&gt;be Socrates

\&gt;Just got done reading v for vendetta, ready to lay some new quips down on dumb peasants

\&gt;Put on my red and black plaid fedora and dress shoes. Goes well with my potato sack where you can see the outline of my chode

\&gt;Head to the market where dirty peasants are bartering with each other

 \&gt;me (looking and making faces at a camera that I imagine is taping this interaction) : Hmm, Yes... hello I would like to buy one watermelon... for every shilling in my pocket, but I will not tell you how many shillings I have I my pocket (smiles with disgusting teeth and clearly needs to floss)

\&gt;dirty salesman: ??? Wtf You playin games with me m8? Err.. ok... How many shillings are in your pocket?

\&gt; Me: I will only tell you if you tell me the structure of time's atomic wheels!!!! (Cackles in awkward silence)

\&gt;dirty salesman: Wot the hell u talking about? U want a damn melon?

\&gt;Me: HAHAA! Fine then! I have no shillings in my pocket !! I do not WANT to buy a watermelon !!!!! You have been tricked!!!

2016 WRX - Extreme Fuel Trims Sorry this isn't a cool picture.  I tried over at NASOIC, but no response.  I have 2016 WRX with Cobb Big SF Intake and Cobb J\-pipe and protune.  Lately, my car really has trouble when idling, so I have been monitoring fuel trims.  Troubleshooting so far:  I recently checked the air filter 1" spacing recommended by Cobb and I also had a smoke test this morning that revealed no leaks.

The car generally is running well during normal driving, but as soon as I stop and idle I get AF Learning 1 @ \-45 and AF Correction @ \+34.  Also, AF Learning Idle stays at \-44.  I am driving very conservatively now to be safe, but my tuner and Cobb asked for WOT numbers and I noticed by boost tops out at about 15 PSI in lieu of the 20\+ it used too be at.

Any ideas of where to go from here?

Is this dangerous to drive?

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I am stuck.

At school some kid really wanted to be retarded So, he's allways been a bit weird. After the boston bombings he said, he'd build a bomb out of a pressure cooker, nails and a phone to blow up the school up and his history presentations are wot trailers. So he was an selfmade outsider. Today the guy, that he sometimes has beef with, told him, that he isN'T retarded and weird guy answered like: how do you know? Maybe I am? Everybody told him that isn't. than he started screaming about himself how retarded he is because he isn't good with people and that he's treated like a retard so he's allowed to act like one, while everybody told him he isn't. Literally got angry because we told him that he isn't retarded.

Fucking idiot

As promised, a review of the actually very nice COBI Tiger 131 kit As the title states, the COBI Tiger 131 kit is actually a pretty sweet bitch of a model. And it's a very nice size, [here it is beside a regular Xbox controller.](https://i.imgur.com/UCa6hcs.jpg) COBI is a Polish company, and humorously enough this model exemplifies the mix of East and West that pervades the Polish character. The brilliantly simple solutions to some complex geometric issues mirrors the Germanic approach to ruthlessly effective engineering, the packaging displays the baffling Soviet tendency to sometimes completely miss the entire fucking point, [and the instructions don't hold your hand in any way, shape or form.](https://i.imgur.com/PkdEY1P.jpg)

That picture is the core of the tank, and the instructions up to that point. If this were LEGO, that core would be made of many different colors, and the instructions would be full color the whole way through. LEGO is really easy because of that. There are also some other basic construction design philosophies that LEGO has to make things easier on people that COBI doesn't follow. That being said, the COBI stuff can be constructed by any reasonably capable person, which statistically almost has to include some WoT players.

If you're going to get a COBI set like this, make sure you have a large, non-black surface to spread shit out. LEGO kits come in numbered bags and sub-bags, this kit has two bags numbered 1 and 2, with a bunch of sub-bags in each. Here's where they miss the whole fucking point, because while bag 1 is the body and bag 2 is the tracks and turret, the sub bags aren't divided in any operational way. You have to open literally every little bag virtually immediately, because you have to take pieces from all of them as you go. That's why you're going to need some space.

Anyway, this tank is solid, as you can't really see in the picture of the core, because it's monochrome black. It's not just a shell set on some tracks, this thing is a brick of bricks, and is very satisfyingly hefty. The fit quality of the COBI bricks is almost indistinguishable from LEGO, but the plastic makes a higher, more brittle sound than LEGO when bounced from a hard surface.

[Here is the finished bag 1, which makes up the body brick.](https://i.imgur.com/VocGhwp.jpg)

[Front of the tank. Gun has articulated elevation, but no depression.](https://i.imgur.com/rYsgd2Q.jpg)

[Rear of tank. Obviously, the turret swivels.](https://i.imgur.com/nHo3w0h.jpg)

[Some extra pieces of track.](https://i.imgur.com/Gm4neQY.jpg) The track is composed of hard plastic pieces which snap together. The pieces move very freely with each other, and all of the bogies also turn freely. So if you push the tank forward, the tracks roll exactly like you would expect them to. This is probably my favorite part of this whole model.

A man walks into a bar, takes a look around, and asks the bartender "...where's the punchline?"

"This is a bar you stupid oaf, not some kid's 5th birthday party," replied a bystander.

"u fookin wot m8?" said the man.

They exchanged insults, ranging from calling the other a "wizard" to putting their phalluses in owls. Eventually the argument got physical.

Other people, the bartender included, started to watch as they started to exchange punches instead of GMod Harry Potter references.

Now, there was *indeed* a punchline. No, more of a punch-crowd, really.

As the events unveiled at the bar, a car slammed into a bus right outside. The accident sent wheels crashing in.

The bartender, the bystander, and most of the crowd was injured by the wheels. At least a few people are dead.

But what's this? The man gets up unharmed, and announces to the crowd, "Attention everyone. I have a confession to make. I lied about the wheels. You see, my name is Bus Driver. I was the Albert Einstein."

"There's something I just don't get," said the bystander from earlier. "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

"Grass," replied the man.

(This is my first time writing something like this. Hoped you liked it. :)

Garelli won't idle (PHBG / 70CC) Hey /r/moped,

I can't get my Garelli to idle with the parts I've recently replaced, most notably the carb. Everything was running fine with the stock carb. Here's my setup:

[Dellorto PHBG 19mm DS race carb](https://www.treatland.tv/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=dellorto-19-race-2695-party) .
[70cc NOI kit](http://www.treatland.tv/garelli-NOI-polini-kit-p/garelli-polini-noi-115.0068.htm) .
[46mm head](https://www.treatland.tv/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=garelli-custom-cut-head-46mm) .
[Exhaust pipe](https://www.treatland.tv/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MLM-noi-pipe-358)

---

I've cleaned out the carb completely with carb cleaner and an air compressor. I've tried every jetting in the 40s range. I've followed these guides with no success:  https://www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/How_To_Tune_PHBG_Carburetors . https://www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/PHBG_tuning_made_easy_(a_step_by_step_guide)

Here's a video demonstrating the failure to idle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k1LDJA-Rio

(I just noticed some air turbulence in front of the carb at WOT, gonna check that out)

And here are some pics: https://imgur.com/a/mzCzwwj

I can follow up with videos or pictures to help with diagnosis. Appreciate your help!

[M4a]ple's Sweet Sounds, Vol. 1, No. 8: Toronto to Texas; Vancouver to Amsterdam [A Two Tartes Musical Joint] As ever: I'm always looking for new sounds, so please comment below, or PM me, if there's anything you'd like me to feature in weeks to come. (Scroll down for the previouslies).

***

This week: a band with moxy (but not Fruvous); and a band wot knows its blues (water and ponies, that is).

(And special thanks again this week to [Zen_Chaos](https://www.reddit.com/u/Zen_Chaos), a man wot [knows](https://www.reddit.com/r/GonewildAudible/comments/86yb5g/m4f_script_fill_morning_wood_public_fucking_in/) his [driftwood](https://www.reddit.com/r/GonewildAudible/comments/84zh63/m4f_script_fill_the_storm_before_the_calm_mastlib/)).

[Moxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxy_(band\)), who originally formed in 1974, were bracketed in their day with "hard rock" or "heavy metals" bands, but brought a lighter, defter touch to the music than most contemporaries. ["Sail On, Sail Away"](https://youtu.be/8oHquY-y4Es), from their debut LP, gives a good idea of their sound. (Yes: that's a wink at Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song" at 2:19, in the second chorus. And you can take it from me that those are some of the most 70's album covers that ever 70'd). ["Can't You See I'm A Star"](https://youtu.be/vnz24V_EEIc), performed live here by a latter-day edition of the band, was another of their hits, but check out also ["Take It Or Leave It,"](https://youtu.be/jZ-AX62zXw4), on which they proved they could swing too. And from the You Never Know Who's Listening Dep't: early on, they established a loyal following in south Texas which continues to this day.

[Hey Ocean!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Ocean!) are from Vancouver, started playing together in 2004, and have done my heart good in many ways. (Not the least of which is playing on the same bill as [Said The Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Said_the_Whale), whom I'll future in a future MSS). ["Amsterdam"](https://youtu.be/k4QE2ik1KRg) is from their fourth and latest LP, ["The Hurt of Happiness"](https://exclaim.ca/music/article/2018-04-02-hey_ocean_-the_hurt_of_happiness) (and I very much doubt the length, 4:20 exactly, is a coincidence). But check out also ["Can't Let Go"](https://youtu.be/BbKBFMHvY3Y), and from 2012, ["Big Blue Wave"](https://youtu.be/yTk6eY9EY5g). Ashleigh Ball, the lead singer, is also a voice actor who has worked on such productions as *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*, and is the main subject of the documentary [A Brony Tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brony_Tale).

One warehouse at a time *[Liberty](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447838534578077696/448231835093172226/Liberty3.png) arrived just as the briefing ended. Envious looks from everyone in the room for getting to skip out of the snooze fest.*

"...Warrant was approved weeks ago." *[Agent O'Brien](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420629181106487296/420633295064268812/image.jpg) informed.* "we've sat on it long enough that they've forgotten about it. Get out there and knock them dead."

*[The](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441360234066214922/image.jpg) [Guards](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447838534578077696/448231835093172226/Liberty3.png) [Themselves](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441330869597241354/image.jpg) nodded and turned to head out. They were about to dish out one of the largest drug busts stellarim had seen in a long while. Meth, Cocaine, and a place that had picked up something related to what the hero slayer from a month ago had taken, now going as agent Lucy or something.*

*It was time for criminals to pay their dues.*

-----

*[toxiclash](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/298161010504761345/425110920306360320/image.png), [allbombbai](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/298161010504761345/425110967589011478/image.jpg), [bastion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403210749716987904/403260653298515968/image.jpg), [burden of beasthood](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403212710549913601/421582025967796225/image.jpg), [kallen](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403212191807045633/405183106144796672/image.jpg), [Jaaku](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403212245212987393/403260715525341184/image.jpg), and [Houel the Butcher](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/403212499303792650/403251449477464064/image.jpg) watched over their warehouse from the loft office as the chemists worked on the new drug they'd hired to be snatched from some company who stole and perfected it from some other armature drug lords with the conscience to trash their stash. The group of seven had set aside their differences to pull together as a sort of pseudo gang following the increase in hero activity.*

"Lucy's one hell of a drug. Took some reengineering, but with this? We can bring in the big dough." *toxiclash chuckled, rapping her fingers along the table as her eye twitched behind her goggles looking at Houel's men work.* "city'll be in disrepair when our supply starts hitting the streets.

"The idea of bomb threats on the other side of the city has worked wonders!" *Allbombbai (ABB) cackled, sighing as he deflated.* "I just wish you'd let me blow shit up again."

"You complain about dumb shit like that when my fighting ring has been strung up and neutered." *Burden of Beasthood (BoB) huffed from across the table.* "what about *My* bottom line? Huh?"

"You mean your dogfighting ring?" *ABB hissed.*

"Shut the fuck up." *Bastion crossed his arms.* "we're here to celebrate, not throw all this in the garbage."

"Knock off." *ABB huffed at bastion.*

"Bastion saved your ass ABB," *Jaaku chuckled.* "you're just too proud to admit it."

"Using plagiarized bombs!" *ABB accused.* "besides, you're supposed to be the bank robber desperado with a team to match? How did you like getting your ass handed to you by a white fucking knight."

"Easy." *Kallen held her hands out to keep Bastion and Jaaku from standing.* "this isn't worth ruining everything, at least none of you have a significant other detained in a sarcophagus for a job gone wrong."

"You can all can it." *Houel chuckled, standing from his seat.* "as long as we stand united, we can outwit even the Walkers-"

*Houel noticed a lookout rushing in, panicked.*

"We have trouble." *Houel grabbed his axe and strode out the door to the catwalk. He looked down with grit teeth behind his helmet and called out.* "what's the situation?"

"Someth-" *The man didn't get to finish as a large disk of asphalt smashed through the side of the warehouse. It was a raid by TGT.*

*Houel thought he'd had their bases covered! Even made sure to move out for a month when his informant told him the government were looking for a warrant to search the place, drop suspicion by making a hiding location and laying low. This had to have been something regarding it.*

"To arms." *Houel rushed to roof access. He needed to get behind the heroes to have the biggest impact and knock them off their feet.*

-----

*Toxiclash leapt into action; specifically, the running kind, out through several side rooms to try to find a window out of this place. She wasn't a fighter, she was a support. Nothing she could do here-*

**bonk**

*Toxiclash hit her head on something and fell on her ass. It was strange she thought she'd checked clearance on that step-*

"Hey, how's it going? This your first time being caught by heroes?" *A voice emanated from a point near where she'd hit her head on.*

"Fuck!" *She swept her Toxic whip to try to hit the invisible guy.*

**Tink** *went the [Shade Drone](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/448523235420798976/image.png) as it was hit by the whip... rather pointlessly.*

"Thaaat's what I expected." *[Hiron](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441330924584435743/image.jpg) sighed with a soft smile as he swung in on his hover board and fired off three shots, [music playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Gg9CqhbP8) from his speakers.*

*the three shots missed, but the first electrified the door ahead as Toxiclash scrambled to find another out.*

"Aw come back!" *Hiron fired off another three rounds. The first whizzed by, the second caught Toxiclash's backpack and the third hit her square in the back of the head, ending up frosting up her body her body as she tumbled to the ground on her back.*

*Hiron swapped elements and pumped two more shots into her, setting off an explosion that threw her against the wall.*

"There we go." *Hiron hopped off his hover board and swapped elements again.* "you ready to cooperate and stop running?"

-----

*BoB vaulted into the police officers in the back room like a gorilla and chucked the officer as far as he could. That's when she hit him.*

*Three gashes in his left arm, severing the connection to the apparatus, a streak of purple. He knew who it was.*

"COME OUT AND FACE ME!" *BoB howled.* "***NIO!!!***"

*[Nio](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441360234066214922/image.jpg) giggled as her [theme](https://youtu.be/G9VSGPmkUc0) played through headphones in her Jacket.* "it's funny you act like an animal and have no respect for them."

*BoB grinned and swung his arm to catch her, launching it on its wire. There was no way she could dodge it-*

*Nio ducked under and slashed at the wire, leaving it flying off, then suddenly, Her talons impaled his shoulders. He yelped in pain as she kicked him off and to the ground.*

-----

*Jaaku hid behind the pillar in the second loading dock and peeked the corner faster than most could register. But not to Jaaku. He saw the one guy, red suit, big brawler gloves. Big slit where his eyes shoulda been. It was so easy.*

*Jaaku whipped around the corner and unloaded his pistol into the poor soul as [music played](https://youtu.be/4DQ-2tDzJxw)-*

*The man, [Buster](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441330946675834891/image.jpg) had rolled into a ball and bounced unpredictably, his bullets only increasing his velocity as he suddenly bounced within range and fired out two black orbs. The orbs stuck on the end of his gun and his shoulder and began inflating. Desperately, Jaaku tried to pull the shoulder one off, only to get his hand stuck. He raised his pistol and fired, causing it to splinter open and have shrapnel tear up his arm.*

"FUCK!" *Jaaku howled as he tripped backwards.*

"Wot in Tarnation d'ya think was gone happ'n partner?" *Buster chortled as he approached, firing a few more black orbs at Jaaku's feet to pin him down.*

-----

*Kallen swung through the rafters and down to run towards the exit. She had to make it out. She didn't want Peter to see her in jail. Not like thi-*

*A fist shimmered into existence at head level and clotheslined her into falling to the ground.*

"I must ask thee to pardon mine physical trauma applied to your Lady-ness." *[Lancelot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441331008638550017/image.jpg) spun his staff as he paced in front of her, his [theme](https://youtu.be/Nw5AMCEiZms) playing through his suit.*

*Kallen scrambled back. Jaaku had mentioned something about this guy. Some quip about being a knight in shining armor? Fuck. Jaaku talked a lot. She drew her bow and fired into his shoulder, but the arrow bounced off and plunged into her knee, forcing her to scream.*

"Milady, I must ask that you cease." *He tapped his staff, a blinding light obscuring her vision entirely.* "now I recommend thee turn over thine bow to avoid further altercations."

-----

*Bastion had to make it to his stash of stolen and reverse engineered tech. Damnit if only he hadn't gone out tonight. It was his daughter's birthday. He should have been there for her. He threw open the door and rushed over to the chest, tugging the latch.*

*It wouldn't budge.*

*He tugged again.*

*nothing.*

"What makes you think I'd give you a chance?" *A voice asked as the door squeaked shut with a thunk.*

*[the music](https://youtu.be/LU1S8dui_5c) from the damn interview started playing. Bastion felt his hairs stand on end as he turned to see [Respire](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441330935367991318/image.jpg).*

"And if I surrender?" *Bastion asked.* "If I out the rest, will you make sure they reduce my sentence?"

*Respite popped his neck.*

"No, but that won't change what's happening next." *Respite chuckled.*

*The chest lurched into Bastion's legs, breaking them as it flew across the room and slammed against the door. He fell flat on his back and held up his arms to protect himself as sheets of paper shot down from the ceiling, impaling his arms and setting off the small explosives, ripping the armor off his now burned arms.*

*Bastion wept for mercy.*

-----

*Houel finally reached the roof and rushed towards the hero's entry point. If he could fall from this height, he would create just the right impact to cause casualties that were unsustainable. He just needed to calculate... he just....*

*Houel suddenly couldn't calculate. Why the hell couldnt he calculate?*

"It's time to stand down." *[Liberty](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447838534578077696/448231860192018432/Liberty4.png) floated down behind him as her [theme](https://youtu.be/pisxxUpS7o8) played.*

*Houel spun to try to slash at her, and went too slow for some reason, liberty floating back as his blade flew helplessly. He panicked and failed calculation again as she soared at him, thirty meters per second and slammed her fist into his helmet, knocking him down and breaking his shoulder blade through his armor.*

"The fuck is with you Heroes?" *Houel barked as he dragged himself away best he could.* "we're just trying to make a damn living!"

*Liberty gave no answer.*

-----

*The police officers had ABB holed up in the office, his deadman switch at the ready. He'd killed five officers already. This was starting to get fun for him!*

"Right now, I've got a bajillion megatons of material ready to blow this place so kingdom come that it'll take hopesdagger up too!" *He threatened as a short figure walked into the room as her [theme](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O7MwJ5WGA_A&amp;feature=youtu.be) played.* "and don't think I won't kill you too kiddo! No funny business! This is a deadman's switch!"

*[Outlook](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441330836151992324/441330993337466902/image.jpg) let out a scowl and made two quick motions with her hand. In an instant the dead man's switch vanished from his hand and the world went dark. Then, he exploded.*

-----

*Outlook sighed as Pandora's box contained the explosion.*

"My guy punched his ticket." *She informed Liberty.*

-----

"Toxic's behaving... finally. Took a few more shots, but things are going much better." *Hiron spoke as he cuffed the woman.*

-----

"This asshole's taken care of." *Nio looked on as EMT treated the damn fool.*

-----

"Guy's got 'im self a few scratches here and there, but he'll live." *Buster chuckled as the black blobs stuck to Jaaku.*

-----

"Thine objective hath been completed." *Lancelot's bravado rang out.*

-----

"My guy's got broken legs." *Respite sighed.*

-----

"Broken shoulder on this guy." *Liberty informed the paramedics on the roof.* "a bunch of other stuff too. Good work, we'll head on back and take tomorrow off."

"...in a turn of events, the rising gang, new londo, was decimated by a hero team making a pointed assault with warrant for all of their actions. They seized three tons of drugs and halted production of more than twelve more tons of drug material. They also managed to seize an armory and stop a bombing-" *Jen turned off the TV, satisfied as CT walked in the apartment main room.*

"Hey sis!" *Jen rushed over to help CT bring in groceries.* "how's work?"

"It's work. What do you want from me?" *CT huffed.*

"CT, you know dad likes me to check on you." *Jen smiled.*

"Why? Cause I'm adopted?" *CT asked bluntly.*

"I mean duh, but also because you're a weirdo." *Jen snorted.* "oh, did you see what TGT did?"

"No, can't say I did." *CT went to put away food.*

"They took on New Londo and decimated them. One of the dudes even blew himself up!" *Jen smiled.* "but now, things are gonna be safer!"

"Oh gee, good for them." *CT checked her phone with a frown. Almost a week and no call from the guy at the club. Oh well.*

"Oh! And the face on that Toxiclash girl? Who woulda thunk supermodel? Right?"

"Right." *CT had already stopped paying attention. Why was Jen so into heroes?*

-----

*CT and Jen stayed in.*

*Annie and Jackson went out to dinner with Ryan and Eleanor.*

*Lance, Todd, John, Harry, Tristan and Hunter stopped into a sports bar.*

*Petra and Heather went to volunteer at an animal shelter a little out of town.*

MF 135 losing prime and/or excessive fuel pressure Hey guys, I have a MF135 w/ the Perkins 3cyl diesel. My dad has had it for ~12-13 years, but never really took care of it. He recently bought a brand new JD 5035, and I inherited the 135 to replace my 130 (I still have the 130, but finding parts is a pain).

When I got it I replaced all the fuel filters, changed the oil &amp; oil filter, changed hydraulic fluid (but not filter, i still have to find one), put in a new battery, battery cables, and had the alternator and starter rebuilt. He had trouble starting it for a little while, now it starts right up, cold or hot, no problem.

When I brought it home after doing all of that, my wife bush hogged our pasture. I was at work, so she was unsupervised. Apparently she ran it at WOT for 3-4 hours while mowing, and she said it ran out of fuel. Great, I brought home some fuel, and went to put it in so I could prime everything back up, but it was almost full of fuel. The glass bowl on the primer pump was full. The glass bowl under the fuel filter on the injector pump was full. I cracked the wing nut under the glass bowl on the injector pump side (I'm assuming that's the legitimate water separator), and it spewed diesel under pressure out of the bowl.

I primed the pump up to the injectors, and it started, and I finished mowing, maybe an hour or two.

I have used it several times to scrape my driveway, always low RPM, barely any load, and it will run fine for that, usually an hour to an hour and a half.

However, if I use it for bush hogging under any sort of a load, it will cut off after 15-20 minutes, like it has run out of fuel. About half the time when I crack the wing nut on the water separator, it will spray fuel out under pressure, and the other half of the time it will suck air in like it was under a vacuum.

It will not start until I start to prime the injector pump, and more often than not it will start before I make it to an injector while bleeding it, usually when I get to the top bleed valve towards the front of the pump.

The prime lever on the glass bowl on the starter side doesn't seem to do anything, I think i may have to get a new diaphragm to go in it.

Do you guys think maybe I have a clogged filter somewhere? Would the prime diaphragm fail and cause any of these symptoms? My pasture is starting to get out of hand with all the rain we have had, and I can barely find my horses through all the dog fennel, and kind of need to get this fixed sooner rather than later.

TYIA for your help.

The driving physics are not that bad, and the problem with the spinning out while driving lies somewhere else. First of all I don't have any official credentials other than I am going to school for engineering and I am focusing specifically on the automotive industry. I did some experimenting yesterday with different gear ratios on the Mustang Fastback w/supercharger that was fully tuned to acheive maximum power; I don't remember the exact numbers, but both torque and HP were 750+ for sure. The tests helped me figure out how the inability to control high powered vehicles could be fixed. Some things I took into consideration while testing was at what RPM was torque the highest and what RPM was HP was highest. For the car I was working with, the max torque was achieved at around 2850 rpm and max HP was around 4000 rpm. The test that helped the most was having a transmission with only one gear with a ratio of around 2:1 and a final drive ratio of .5:1. I did this to make sure that the engine was at a severe mechanical disadvantage over the weight of the vehicle. When I drove it, the vehicle was totally controllable until about 2400 rpms which is where the torque curve begins to spike for this engine, at around 2400 RPMs, the RPMs skyrocketed to redline because the wheels began spinning. This happens for a few reasons but I don't want to delve too deep into that for the sake of time. Basically there are 4 things at play here in the simplest of settings with no outside variables - The amount of rotational force the engine is producing (torque), The speed at which the torque is being put out (horsepower), the weight of the vehicle, and the friction between the tires and the ground. Now here is where the issue lies in the game; when you push down the "W" key to accelerate, the game recognizes that as wide open throttle (WOT). When you take a car as powerful as the ones made in the game, then go wide open throttle (in the default gearing of the game), the amount of rotational force created by the engine will over come the frictional force created by the weight of the vehicle and the contact between the rubber tires and pavement. I realize it is hard to do with a keyboard, but the solution that I think could fix the issue would be to implement some way to have a gradual increase in throttle instead of having either WOT or no throttle at all. The best way I found to accelerate in a controlled manner is to not hold down "W", but to press it then release and repeat this until the transmission reaches the highest gear and the engine RPM has moved past the torque peak of the engine, at this point holding down "W" won't cause the car to spin out.

\&gt;Head to the market where dirty peasants are bartering with each other

\&gt;me  (looking and making faces at a camera that I imagine is taping this  interaction) : Hmm, Yes... hello I would like to buy one watermelon...  for every shilling in my pocket, but I will not tell you how many  shillings I have I my pocket (smiles with disgusting teeth and clearly  needs to floss)

\&gt;dirty salesman: ??? Wtf You playin games with me m8? Err.. ok... How many shillings are in your pocket?

\&gt; Me: I will only tell you if you tell me the structure of time's atomic wheels!!!! (Cackles in awkward silence)

\&gt;dirty salesman: Wot the hell u talking about? U want a damn melon?

\&gt;Me: HAHAA! Fine then! I have no shillings in my pocket !! I do not WANT to buy a watermelon !!!!! You have been tricked!!!

A life of gaming, A life wasted. I’m sitting here, it’s 00:01 12/06/2018 when I’m starting this and I’m thinking to myself ‘how on earth have I got to this point in my life’. Over a decade living my life on games. It’s actually Almost two decades if we count the days of Playstation 1 and 2. I’ll be 25 years old coming on January 6th and very little to show for it.

My name is David and I come from Ireland, North of. I wish to share my story of how gaming has destroyed my life and has left me in a mess both physically and mentally. If when you read this you are a young teen, a parent or a person going down my road I urge you in all of these cases to examine my story and ask yourself is this what you want for yourself or your loved one?

We start back in the good old days of being a kid, early 2000s I got a Playstation 1. I spent hours on that thing, my dear father and mother couldn’t afford much but they scraped money together and so it came to be. It was innocent enough, get home from school and straight in to play from my last save point. I’d go to bed very late for a young kid sitting up in the dark when my parents were asleep just to make progress. I would be sooo tired at school each day looking back.

Playstation 2 came out, same thing parents scraped together and got me that – this time a few years had passed and I had actually improved with playing, I would go out to play with friends after school. By 2006/2007 I was in secondary school and had got a very basic PC which then was followed closely by a thing called the Internet.
Before I dive into the MMOs I wish to say that I do not blame my parents for this, my mother isn’t a well person and my father has had to manage her health (mental) with trying to give me the best life he could. Was it a mistake to get the consoles? Maybe and did was I allowed to play too much? probably that answer is yes but again things at our house were never normal because of the way life was and probably my father thought having the games would distract me from noticing my mother’s mental illness and it did. I love them both dearly and always will.

Seafight was the first game I got into online, a browser game made by the company Bigpoint – most people will not know of it. In essence an MMO p2w browser game (for the less informed folks, a game that you could win easily in with loads of money). From 2006 to 2010 the next 4 years would be dominated by the game, summers spent totally obsessed and as a young kid I got recognition and feelings that I never experienced in the real world. I was respected and well known in the community, loved by many and developed some really good friendships online with folks there. Looking back perhaps they saw someone who was deeply trouble and I will never forget the love shown although I wasn’t so aware of it then.

Around this point we should probably go back to the real world and look at how I was as a kid. As long as my memory goes back I had weight issues, the biggest kid in the class .. couldn’t get proper school trousers to fit so I worse black tracksuit bottoms instead of grey trousers. (I think to myself now I was always the odd one out come to think of it and probably is why today I see it as me vs all of you) I wasn’t bullied or anything like that, I had good friends and was well liked. I actually had more issues with some idiots in primary school than high school which was good. People took pitty on me I think and I learned what I now call ‘The art of getting by’ (Maybe I should write a piece on that for a method to counter bullying :P) to manoeuvre my way through those years.

Ok so we have my character and we have the history to this point, enter 2 games which would take me to this very day. World of Tanks and World of Warcraft. I moved between them over the years but spent hundreds of hours in each game.

World of Warcraft was a big thing during the high school years which took me right up to 16, I let literally everything go to the dogs.. my father fought me every day to get me to school and I would find every reason in the book as to why I couldn’t go. WoW was my everything, the obesity just carried on getting worse and worse and I became more locked away from people. The gap widened between me and society so much, at this point all friends were online and I went off the radar for the most part.

I left school at the earliest point, it was a special kind of hell to me. I found comfort, respect and recognition again in both WoW and WoT that I missed from my earlier browser game. In my mind people couldn’t judge me for my looks, only my ability in the games. I lived for them and would of died (might yet) for them.

My reward system was food and gaming. Gaming allowed things like my obesity, the outlook I had in life to fall away.. nothing mattered. I came away from school with few GCSEs. (not sure outside of the UK what you have but when you leave high school you get these) I then enrolled with a training provider to do ICT, it was a stupid idea because it was not worth the paper it was written on. Over the two years I would be put on placements with companies to gain work experience, it was just failure after failure for me. Each failure would just make me eat the feelings away and game hard into the night.

We now get to the scary part, 18-24 years old…. almost 25. This has been the fastest period of my life, it has disappeared and still I battle obesity and now depression which was a given when you see what I have done. I’ve been on social security, a burden on the system designed to help people in tough times out of work. Slowly but surely I’ve become more and more damaged mentally, less interested in people and less interested in life. I couldn’t care if I died tomorrow but I worry about my parents and family so I hope I don’t for their sake. (They’ve done what they could)

For probably the 10th time today I gave up gaming this time I've uninstalled everything and I've sent a few messages to the remaining friends telling them why I had to disappear and why I will never look back. If I tried to speak with them on discord or wait for their response they probably would convince me to keep in contact which would no doubt end in me joining them again. I’ll tell myself that anyways because thinking any other way hurts, yes …. pathetic.

I’ve been off bad foods for 1 week, started the gym going on 1 week and come to the conclusion that this is my 1 final chance.. (lots of 1s ^^). At 25 I have foolishly cost myself so many life experiences, If I'd addressed these problems earlier then I might have had a much different life but I’m very much of the view that you sleep in the bed that you make for yourself and so I will.

My goals for the time I have left? Never game again, half my body weight (368lb currently), get a job and to keep addressing the underlying issues which caused all of this. I focused so much on IRL things as well as the gaming part of this because I want to stress that to stop the gaming addiction you must first be willing to address what caused and what continues to cause it.

For me that is obesity, my lazy attitude to life and now also depression which I’m managing quite well myself. I don’t want sympathy, I want someone to see this and change course long before I did. Do not walk the line that I walked and I have a final 1 for you.

**You get 1 life, I often think .. well duh unless you believe otherwise. Think on that - every hour you spend mining/raiding/battling you will never get back, it is gone. There is no respawn, there is no boss reset and there is no save feature. It’s hard mode on diablo, when you die you die.**

(I’m not good at this writing stuff but I felt compelled to put my story out there, yes it was a wall of text and I rambled but I hope the message got across) For the record, it’s now 1 hour later 01:01 ^^.

TL;DR Yea.. I wouldn't of read it either haha ;)

*Phew, now that I got that off my chest I can move forward just that little bit easier :) *

Huge difference in MPG when using Shell 93 vs. Costco 93. Anyone else notice a difference? Recently went on a long trip (about 350 miles) and averaged 26 MPG on relatively flat land, shifting before the shit light, super light throttle, cruse control, and keeping it around 75-80 MPH on Costco 93 gas. Second leg (Knoxville, TN to Asheville, NC) I stopped to get gas at Shell as Costco was out of the way. Hard pulls in 3rd, 4th, and 5th with plenty of WOT, no babying, I don't even think I put it into 6th, lot's of city driving with no effort of fuel savings, and I saw just over 26 MPG with 1/2 city and 1/2 highway. On the trip home with all highway I saw 31.xx MPG with plenty of WOT pulls and minimal 6th gear in the mountains and no effort for fuel savings. Second tank on the way back got me home and through my work week and I saw 26 MPG with 85% city. Filled up again today at shell and in 20ish miles of driving, the read out is saying 26.xx MPG with all city and I'm not trying.

Costco gas never came close even when I baby the car 100%. Am I crazy? My average thank from Costco saw 21 MPG with 66% city and 33% highway, all easy commuting. Is there really that much difference? Both are Top Tier.

FYI, I always calculate the MPG on fill up and the readout is usually reading to many MPG on Costco gas and when using Shell the readout is showing lower MPG then what it actually is.

Brian's War - narrative campaign fluff story continues . . . I'm participating in a local gaming group's narrative escalation campaign. This is the story of Brian, my tech-priest dominus - if anyone's interested, I can post parts 1-3 of his story so far below.

Brian fought the greenskins this month, and lost. This is what happened next . . .

------------------------------

Brian woke up in a dungeon. Someone had gone to very great lengths to ensure that people waking up here didn’t waste time with stupid questions like “Where am I?” and “Is this a dungeon?”. It was definitely a dungeon, and you were definitely in it. It had flickering candles and walls covered in slime. It was fetid, it was clammy, it was shadowy, stinky and filthy. The walls groaned beneath the weight of adjectives.

“Wakey wakey mister clickety-clack! It’s time youz and I got ta work!”.

The voice was rough and dark, words falling strangely from an alien mouth. From the gloom at Brian’s side came a mechanical whirring as something bulky stomped through the darkness towards him. Candles blinked and a sharp tang like roasted manure filtered through Brian’s mask.

A huge, hulking creature emerged. An ork. It was obviously an ork. It looked like the type of orks that children drew in the Imperial nursery pens; a walking mass of warts, muscles and bad attitude. It was green and scarred and smelled like a compost heap. One eye, slitted and bulbous, stared out malevolently from beneath a jutting brow, while the other skittered unnervingly from side to side. Its tusks were worn and jagged, and the creature’s thick jaw chewed restlessly.

Orks accumulate armor like hermit crabs, and if you know what to look for you can trace their life history from spore to toadstool to hulking green bastard. On this beast, old bits of wood and tattered cloth were buried incongruously beneath rusted scrap metal and rubber tyres. Piled onto this were more recent additions, clearly regarded as fine battledress for an ork warrior; tank treads, manhole covers, and what looked suspiciously augmetic kneecaps from one of Brian’s skitarii troopers. The ork lumbered over, clanking and rattling, until it towered over the hapless tech-priest.

“Now den, mister clickety-clack! We knows wot you are - yer a mek, ain’t ya? Like wot I am, only a bit runty an’ dim”. The hulking monstrosity leaned in closer. “Mind you, your lot are always makin’ dat big stuff, da real interestin’ kit. You’ve got dem big stompy lads dat shout all da time, an’ dem little squishy fellers dat do all da screamin’, and da real ‘uge gits dat take days and *days* of choppin’. Not proper *engineerin’*, not like what us orks make, but pretty in-jee-nee-us all da same.”

It leaned in even closer. A thin pink worm peered out from inside the great green nostrils, inching further and further into the air in search of food. Brian was about to speak up when the ork’s tongue snapped up and dragged the wriggling, writhing worm down into its gullet.

“But most of ALL, humie, your lot makes GREAT BIG GUNZ! Now DAT’S what we need - shootas, blasters, burnaz, sluggaz, smashaz, krushaz - DA LOT!”

Brian kept quiet. He didn’t like where this was heading.

“YOU’RE gonna build us da best kit around, humie! We’re gonna shoot ‘em and blast ‘em, and blast ‘em some more if we feel like it, ‘cos you’re gonna make us some right nasty shootas”. The mek slammed a huge box down on the workbench, filled to the brim with brightly coloured pieces of wire, lengths of tubing, metal plates, plugs, sockets, bolts and vaguely shiny objects. Brian stared across at the ork. It stared back with one eye, while the other spun gently in its socket.

This was too much; it was bad enough that he’d been abducted by this pack of pea-green psychopaths, but asking him to defile the machine spirit by *building something* out of *scrap?*

“Are you mad? I can’t do that!”, Brian wailed, “This is nothing but . . .* junk!* You can’t make weapons out of this, you need templates, tried and tested designs! Guidance, benediction, blessings and sacred oils! You can’t just . . . *make it up!* That’s heresy!”

“Don’t play DUMB with me, humie!” the ork roared “this here is PRIME gubbinz, and you’re gonna build us some big bloody shootas! Keep muckin’ about and I’ll lop yer feet off, understand?”

Brian shook with nervous energy. The ork’s eye spun ferociously now, and what looked like a thin jet of steam was escaping from its ear; it looked absolutely unhinged. Not that an eight-foot sentient fungus ever looked particularly hinged.

The funny thing was, thought Brian, that life often seemed like it really couldn’t get any worse. He’d been beaten up and beaten down, abducted and betrayed until he was sure that nothing more could possibly go wrong. But then life surprised you by having a grotesque green maniac hack your feet off with an axe.

Cursing under his breath, he got to work. Back home on the forgeworld he’d never actually made anything himself - that was beneath the dignity of a tech-priest, even one as lowly as Brian. He grasped the basic idea, though; you began with useless bits and fiddled with them until you had something you wanted. All it came down to, really, was the right sort of fiddling.

Brian grabbed a metal tube out of the box and glued some colourful bits of plastic on top. A few bolts here, a little frayed wiring there, and some vaguely electrical-looking things positioned strategically. He took some tinfoil and wrapped it carefully along the “barrel” of the “gun”. His ork counterpart watched him intensely, like a teacher examining a star pupil. Every so often it would grunt softly and nod as Brian attached a particularly gaudy piece of rubbish. Brian kept on gluing, weaving and hammering until the tube was entirely covered in worthless, shiny junk, then set the finished piece aside.

It looked like something a particularly slow, mutated hive child might build to play a game of Marines and Traitors in the sludgy underlevels of Metalica. It was not impressive.

“Very IM-PRESS-IVE, human. Dis is what we like - real good shootas, real blasty!”  The ork picked up the “shoota” and pointed it at the wall. It grasped the trigger and grinned. “Duck an’ cover, lads! ‘Ere it comes!” The mek pulled the trigger back expectantly. Nothing happened. In the silence Brian hopped from foot to foot, making use of them while he still could.

“Ha! Stoopid humie! You left da *safety catch* on! Us orks don’t need safety catches - we only blast what we wanna blast!” Brian had no idea what the beast was talking about. There was no safety catch. The trigger mechanism was a rusty bike handle - it wasn’t even connected to anything. This didn’t seem to deter the mek, who sighted along the tube once more and pulled the trigger.

ZZZAP! BLANG-BLANG-BLANG!

The gun spat fire, blasting orange-hot craters across the dungeon wall. Rock blistered and crumbled, stone chips scattered across the room. Behind his mask, Brian’s jaw hung slackly open.

“YEEES! DAT’S WHAT WE LIKE! GET THE LADS IN ‘ERE - WE’RE GONNA HAVE DA SHOOTIEST KIT AROUND!”

The next few hours were the strangest, and perhaps the happiest, of Brian’s life. Green-skinned monstrosities piled into the room, clamouring and shouting for him to make their gun “da blastiest”, “da killiest” or “da shootiest”. Brian was only too happy to oblige, and quickly discovered that a little imagination went a long way with orks.

His clients slammed their ramshackle, oversized guns down on the bench in front of him and stared in fascination as Brian wired a bent antenna onto the barrel, or painstakingly attached a leaky car battery. He would then solemnly inform the owner that the gun was now capable of unleashing an electrical storm or propelling a slug through the side of a battle tank. Invariably, no matter how outlandish Brian’s claims, the weapon would oblige with a spectacular display of firepower.

Crackling bolts of electricity and hyper-velocity slugs flew through the air as delighted orks showed off their new, extra-blasty weapons. The fancier the gun and the bigger the ork, the more extravagant the effects would be; particularly large or angry specimens would find their weapons generating anything from a searing blast of pure energy to a highly compressed gravitational singularity that crumpled reality like a wet blanket.

Brian’s technical expertise, such as it was, made a perfect match for orkish imagination. He had no real knowledge or understanding of what he was doing, but that didn’t seem to matter: the greenskins were convinced he was an engineering genius, so that’s what he was. “The intra-dental manipulator here, Goresnak” he would say, pointing to a bundle of frayed wires or a wad of foil, “is utterly crucial; without it, the elastic illuminator and neural clamp won’t focus”. Goresnak would then nod wisely and promptly discharge the weapon into the wall, ceiling, or a neighbour, who would inevitably have their neurons clamped and dentals manipulated. It wasn’t pretty.

For the first time in his life, Brian was respected. He might be in the company of what were essentially angry mushrooms, but no-one was trying to kill him. They thought he was a genius. They *valued* him. Deep inside, Brian felt something he hadn’t felt in a long time. Could this be home? Bizarre though it sounded, he already felt happier amongst these greenskins than he ever had amongst his fellow priests; the arrogant, patronising *gits* who had always disdained him.

Perhaps, finally, he had found somewhere he could be happy.

BLAM! The dungeon wall blasted inwards with an almighty crash and an enormous robot thundered through the breach. With fists the size of engine blocks it waded into the crowded orks, while a second machine behind it spewed incandescent flames. Before the orks had time to move the machines had smashed them to pieces; what had been a room full of excited green ladz was now a heap of seared meat, metal and bone. The robots lurched heavily past Brian and out through the door, where hoarse shouting and the *thud-thud-thud* of small arms fire announced the continuing battle.

“Are you the one they call . . . Brian?” called a voice from the newly-excavated hole. A spindly-looking enginseer, all dangling tubes and strange appendages, was looking at him with eager interest. “We’re here to rescue you!”

Brian gazed in shock at the carnage around him. Here and there amongst the bodies he could make out the smashed, blackened remnants of rifles wrapped with extravagantly-coloured wiring, and half-melted lightbulbs stuck to oversized pistols. At his feet lay the childish weapon he’d first assembled out of nothing but junk, burned and twisted beyond repair. He grasped it with one shaking mechadendrite and held it up to his mask.

With the orks dead it was once more a useless, pointless thing, made from nothing but unwanted scrap. The creatures that valued it, that had valued *him*, were gone, smashed into nothingness in the blink of an eye.

His voxcaster held his voice steady when he answered, but behind his bronze mask the tech-priest could feel hot tears running down his face.

“That’s me. I’m Brian.”

Boat runs 5mph slower, doesn't reach max rpm, and hesitates at WoT when adding 1 passenger Hello,

I've been having issues this season with my 1996 75HP TLPTO 3cylinder Mercury 2-stroke in freshwater.  This has been occurring consistently on numerous trips on the lake for the past 4-6 weeks since it first touched the water for this year.  It reaches max RPM and top speed if it's only me in the boat, but adding a passenger (170lbs) with no extra gear creates the following issues:

 - boat runs 5-7mph slower (usually 37-40mph, now 30-32mph)
 - motor doesn't reach max rpm at wide open throttle
 - motor randomly hesitates while cruising at wide open throttle (me &amp; passenger will be going 30mph at WoT and without touching the throttle or hitting any waves, the motor will drop RPMs and slow down to 27mph and eventually go back up to 30mph)

Some previous troubleshooting and information:

 - STORAGE: carbs are fogged with fogging oil prior to winter storage
 - STORAGE: fuel stabilizer is added to the gas tank prior to winter storage
 - PROP: running the same prop for the entire time I've had the boat (6 years) and ive never had passenger running issues in the past
 - FUEL: all winterized gas is long through the system, i'm running on fresh gas (ethanol free)
 - FUEL: added seafoam to the gas tank (this fixed the issue when it first arose last fall, but has not made a difference yet this year after using 3 cans about 2-3 weeks ago)
 - FUEL: drained, inspected, reinstalled fuel filter
 - PLUGS: new spark plugs
 - TRIM: when it's only me in the boat and it's running max rpm at 37mph, i can trim the motor up to its max trim height before cavitation and the boat runs straight with no porpoising; BUT when i add a passenger, the boat porpoises when it reaches its (slower) top speed at 30mph when attempting to trim it up to its usual max trim height

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  my local contact has been swamped all year and isn't even responding to texts and i'm not sure where to look next.

Running rich; pilot screw adjustment ? So my friend says my KLR runs rich (some smoke clouds when WOT, almost never needs choke to cold start, apparently the exhaust smell) and I am the second owner of this bike. The previous owner put in a jet kit and a full exhaust system. So the pilot screw has already been drilled out. My question is:

Which way is which? Google says all kind of conflicting answers. For a first generation stock carb KLR650, does turning the pilot screw clockwise richen, or lean it out ? I just did about 3 turns clockwise before I read somewhere else that clockwise is more rich. This is very confusing.  Is a "fully seated" screw fully clockwise tight or fully counterclockwise tight ?

New to me ALH is a flop. Advice needed. I bought a 2002 Jetta GL TDI yesterday with 209k on it. I didn't pay much for it because the engine is misfiring and smoking. And I was prepared to swap the motor if that's the route this will go. Here are the symptoms.


No power, uphills on the highway dragged  me to 35-45mph on my way home from the purchase.

The boost gauge indicates 4-5psi of boost at WOT.

Misfiring pretty badly on cylinder #1.

At 1800-2000rpm the engine runs smooth (highway) but anything lower than that it misfires badly.

Tons of blue smoke out the tail while driving.

Compression test results show cylinder #1 very low compression.

CEL on for - P0301 Cyl #1 misfire, P1556 , and P1562. (my scantool will not define the last 2 codes)

The background story on this car was that the car ran great until the girls brother tried to do an egr delete. Killed the battery and the car sat for months. They charged the battery and had it running. Starts right back up after shutting off.


I'm assuming that Cylinder #1 is dead. OR the timing belt popped and they put a new one on hoping the valves weren't bent. But maybe they are. Tomorrow after I'm done working I was going to try out a leakdown test and see if any air is escaping out of the valve. If not, is there any reason to yank the head or should I just be spending my time looking for a motor due to bent rod or bad piston rings? I'm new to TDI's so i'm just looking for some expert advice before I start tearing everything apart.

Thanks for any advice you may be able to offer!

Turbosmart BOV issue Installed a Turbosmart BOV last night. Since then the oil pressure guage has been acting almost like my boost guage, on Wot it jumps up to about 55 psi and on release it goes back down to 20.  I don't remember it ever fluctuating so intensely before. I did set my turbosmart on the hardest setting. Is this normal, or do I have an issue? My car seems to be boosting just fine, and the BOV sounds fantastic

The Oath Of Mars, Part 2: Caravan Hello, brave redditors! Today, I bring you the second part of my latest story. A mystery awaits the Rose Legion in the Skyrakers; of course, the Commander and his old mentor need to get there without killing one another first. The [Fanfiction.net link for the story,  and the rest of the chapters, can be found here.](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12970260/2/The-Oath-Of-Mars) As always, constructive criticism is greatly appreciated, and I hope you enjoy...

 \----------------------------------------------

**The Oath Of Mars, Part 2: Caravan**

 \----------------------------------------------

Asteria stood before Mars Gradivus, high priest of the god of war, her armor- what little of it was afforded to a pit fighter- banged and ripped, wounds freshly plugged by dried blood.

The sun pounded down, and, caught by the gilded *Lorica* of the warrior saint, seemed to make him glow before his subjects. Rising from his seat in the private booth, he throws his arms wide.

"A valorous display, Asteria of Afri! Mars the Father smiles upon you!"

She stayed silent, even as the people roared. All the dark-skinned woman did was spread her arms wide, calmly accepting the praise lavished unto her by the bloodthirsty crowds. A lion, a hippo, and a half dozen slaves lay around her.

As he looked down, a smile came to his lips. More glorious a fighter this land has never known. She exceeded even her father in sheer might.

A warrior without equal. A champion.

A suitable offering for his lord.

**~~----------------------------------------------~~**

"Auggghh! What did you feed me, poison?! My head!"

The warden sat, head in hand, groaning. They were in a rickety little carriage, heading south for the Skyrakers.

"Remind me never to drink anything you give me again!"

"Never drink anythin' I give ye again."

"Quit shouting!"

They hit a bump on the dirt path and she shouts as if shot.

"Dammit! I'm walking!"

"Y'sure ye can?"

"O-of course I can!"

She rises, immediately stumbles to her side as the wagon shifts into a pothole, and falls out.

"Hah!"

"SHUT UP!"

After a few seconds of struggling in the mud, someone offers her a hand.

"Got you."

Taking it blindly, she's pulled up to her feet by the woman.

"...Th-thank you kindly."

"Don't tell me Garth's converted you, my dear? It's the devil's drink, you know."

"What-!"

Her head snaps up! Elizabeth!

"M-milady! It's you!"

"It's me. Never expected to see *you* stumbling out the back of a cart with a hangover."

The warden chuckles nervously, suddenly feeling much younger.

"This is a one time thing, I swear. *Never again,* I tell you. And, well... A lot's changed."

"Yes. It has. Come, walk with me. It's a ways to the battleground yet."

**~~----------------------------------------------~~**

Marius looks over his shoulder, eyes on the two women. Sighing and looking forwards once more, he strokes his colossal warhorse's flank affectionately.

"At least *you're* still on my team, Lamri."

The thing was an almost fantastically big slab of white muscle, cloaked in layers upon layers of silver-gilt barding and pink heraldry. He was convinced the lawbringer's warhorses had rhinos somewhere down the family tree, with how large and tough they were. Of course, they had to be to haul a Lawbringer in full plate up and down the frontier without going swaybacked.

Lashed to her side was the equally impressive length of pink and red metal he brought to bear in battle, the Rose. The Grand Master of the Lawbringers had awarded it to him personally, along with his title of Legion Commander, for his role in the battle of Rosa Collis. Why he decided to make it, and in turn, his legion's standards, mostly ***pink*** when roses are wholly ***red,*** is beyond him.

Rosa Collis. That distant memory. The siege where, just for one night, Chosen and Legion fought as one.

The battle that started his career.

He can't help but think back to their... well, 'conversation' last night.

*'What was I to do?! Tell me that!'*

*'Do you not remember why yours is the ROSE legion?!'*

'*I didn't have a choice!*'

*'OF COURSE YOU DID!*'

How dare she? She didn't have a damn clue what she was talking about. She was a peacekeeper. She walked around in the shadows slitting throats. What did she know about leading an army? *Talk sense?!* The Mireites weren't *talking.* He did all he could, ordered the retreat, but they blocked the way. He had no choice but to charge through. They were willing to kill them all. What did she want? For him to order his men to lay their swords down and die?

"Yer mumblin', boss."

"GAH!"

He almost falls off his horse. There Garth was, sitting just to his left, eyes level with his own courtesy of the cart he was riding on.

"Damn! Seeing you dredge yerself from the mud woulda been a fine spectacle!"

"*Ser Brickender...*"

"Jokin'! Jokin'! I'm with ye, boss. The boys, too. Y'hear?"

Readjusting himself on Lamri's back, he sighs deeply.

"...Thank you, soldier. It's just..."

"That sneaky bint told you yer th'devil?"

"Yes. Something to that effect."

"Hah! Ye'd never think from lookin' at her- or hearin', for that- but she's an idealist, down t'her blood. And she hated that skelly-faced metal bitch somethin' fierce. This wartorn shitshow, right outta the brain of that crazy fucker, doesn't sit right with her. She doesn't want to be a part of it. And seein' you darn your socks, shine your axe, and march up north t'kill some mudwalkers? When she looks at that, she remembers that this IS the real world, and that she ain't gonna wake up one day with the shudders and pissed sheets."

Marius looks down and sighs.

"I just wish things were the way they used to be."

He shoots a quick glance at his ex con friend.

"Excepting you, actually, I quite like how you've turned out. Less insane rambling."

"I know, righ'?! Turns out, the Mire root hooch I always used to make in the ole' still was *mildly* psychotropic. Poisonous, too! Had to be quit a' the stuff."

"Is... that so?"

**~~----------------------------------------------~~**

"Ghosts? You think it's ghosts?"

"No! No! I don't think it's ghosts! That was hyperbole!"

The peacekeeper puts a hand to her mask.

"I'm just saying that whoever they are, the Iron Legion hasn't seen them before. Not in the whole of our history has a foreign army attacked from the south. Do you understand? The map just *stops* south of the Skyrakers."

"How terrifying! We have no idea what lies beyond!"

"Aside from historical record, no. And who knows what's changed south of the *Mare Nostrum* in all those centuries?"

"If we have to fight from both sides..."

"Yes. The Legions have always relied on their safe southern border in warfare. The very survival of our civilization would be at stake. Even more than it already is, of course."

She spit that last sentence out. Anxiously, the warden slows her pace, glancing at the bitter peacekeeper.

"...Milady. You know he did what he did to keep us safe? And the rest of the Legion? We were his *friends*. The most important things in the *world* to him."

"That's no excuse. Peace *was* possible. It ***was***, and don't let *anyone* tell you otherwise. But we fucked it all up. And now? Everything's... changed. He's not the man I knew anymore. Grits his teeth and rages. Always ready to boil over if he doesn't keep a handle on himself. And you... you're *drinking!*"

"You know, I *am* an adult, despite my youthful looks and upbeat personality, yes?"

"W-well... but-but that's... just not you! You shouldn't drink! It's unnatural! An-and Garth is... Well, he's doing a lot *better*, actually. What's up with that?"

"Ah, yes! Turns out, his attempt to make the roots of Mire trees into alcohol instead created a sort of *'poisonous mescaline broth'*, as the doctor said. Simple mistake on his part."

"...Ah."

**~~----------------------------------------------~~**

"What *is* that book you keep on flipping through, anyway?"

Elizabeth looks up, startled. They had found a new wagon, away from the Legion Commander, to rest their feet.

"Oh, this? It's... history."

"History?"

"Yes. *Big* history."

The warden cranes her neck, trying to see the contents of the battered little notepad.

"I mean... It is quite little, actually."

"This is a journal. Written by a soldier named Publius. I don't know how it came into the Peacekeeper's possessions, or how we've looked over it. Perhaps it's small size obfuscated it's titanic import."

"W-what? You speak as if you've found the *Sangreal*."

"I might as well have, dear. This... is the last record of the fall of the Empire."

"The Empire?! No one knows what happened to them!"

"Until now. We've always assumed that the Legions arose from the Empire's remnants- more from hubris than anything- but it seems we were almost correct."

"Almost?"

"Yes. You see, it was not a slave revolt or a war with the Chosen that destroyed the empire, but an ideological schism within the very highest echelons of the government itself. A *civil war*. My good friend Publius fought for the seperatists. He fought for Christendom."

"*What?!*"

"Yes. We have a multitude of records detailing the intricate beliefs of the Empire, centered around a pantheon of many gods. But it seems that this faith felt threatened by the rise of a new religion. Christians were fed to animals, burned alive, or lashed to crosses. The brutal subjugation lasted for decades, until a rebel faction overthrew the Emperor and exiled the loyalists who practiced the *cultos* to lands unknown. The rebels assumedly began to drift apart and form differing factions of their own, eventually forgetting their origins- much of their historical record destroyed in the fighting, or 'tainted' by pagan belief- and grew to become the Legions we know today."

"Astonishing! I could never have imagined such a thing to occur, much less be forgotten by history!"

"Few care for it as much as you or I, dear. I've examined it thoroughly, and it seems to be genuine. If it's a forgery, its the most skillfully crafted specimen I've ever seen."

"Have you read all of it?!"

"Well, yes, several times over. Why?"

"May I borrow it?!"

"It's a war diary, not a novel. I doubt it will be as *rousing* a read as you think."

"*Please?*"

"I wasn't saying I wouldn't, you know..."

"Thank you very much, milady!"

Handing it to the eager Warden with a chuckle, the Peacekeeper turns to look out the back of the covered wagon. The sun was shining, birds sung happily through the trees. All was calm. For the first time in a long time, she had a smile on her face.

Almost seemed like old times.

**~~----------------------------------------------~~**

"Why do you blokes get all the nice toys, anyway?! I'd like to get a crack at those damn bombs 'a yours!"

The Conqueror, his Commander, and several men at arms slammed their drinks back.

"Come on, Garth! You've already made yourself a eunuch with that flail of yours, so why go around asking to get your ass blown off, too?"

"Wot?! Do I sound like a soprano to you?"

"Come on! Give a borderline untrained conscript a mace on a string and tell him to swing it around? With all the knocks your boys've gone through, my *mare's* probably a bigger man than you are! ***ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LAMRI?!***"

The horse, drinking from a small stream nearby, rears back and whinnies in response, sending the gathering of troops around the campfire into fits of uproarious and slightly drunken laughter.

"Well *I* ain't the one making all of us dress up in pink an' roses, aren't I?"

"And who's to say pink and roses aren't manly?! Name one *feminine* thing that's pink!"

"Flowers!"

"Only some of them!"

"And tell me one thing that's *manly* that's pink!"

"Raw meat!"

"An' what about roses, huh?!"

"You ever get a rose stalk stuck in your unmentionables, Garth? You won't think of them as dainty little flowers after that!"

"Hah, who's the eunuch now, eh?!"

And once again the gathering explodes. The two slam their tankards together vigourously, laughing with them.

"You ain't lost yer sense a humor, commander! I taught ya well!"

Knocking the decidedly non-poisonous ale back and calming down a bit, the Conqueror gesticulates wildly at him with the other hand.

"Hey, who do you figure we're goin' up against at the Skyrakers, boss? The boys 'ave been asking me to bug ya 'bout it."

"I dunno, Garth. Elizabeth has her money on ghosts, though."

"Ghosts?!"

"But ghosts or no, I know one thing for certain!"

Gaze sweeping over the gathered soldiers, catching their attention, he grins wide.

"With men like yourselves, we'll **KICK THEIR ASSES RIGHT BACK OVER THAT MOUNTAIN!** ***HEAR HEAR!*****"**

Raising his mug high, he *roars.*

***"TO THE IRON! TO THE ROSE! TO THE LEGION!"***

His men repeat the toast with similar vigor, cries of jubilation echoing through the woods. Laughing, Marius takes another swig of ale, head momentarily inclined up, towards the clear night sky above. The stars twinkled up above, untarnished and wholly free of things like war, and grudges, and betrayal. And, he realized, in that moment, he felt free of them, too.

Almost seemed like old times.

**~~----------------------------------------------~~**

Gradivus stood before his personal *centuria*, the hundred men assigned as his personal honor guard and task force, Gladius held high.

"My sons! For too long, our people have gone **unchallenged!** Our claws grow *dull*, our skin *softens*, our flesh becomes laden with *fat!* From the northlands of Olympus to the sunburned wastes of the south, we have conquered!"

He sweeps his other hand, clad in a heavy, gilded gauntlet with a *caestus* built into the knuckles, over the vast, yawning vista behind them.

"All that we see lies within our domain! But we are not yet without glory left to claim, for Mars the Father has ***shown us the path!*** A new page in our history has been revealed to us! And whether you live as victors, or die with glory, the names scribed upon it *shall be yours!*"

The soldiers roared, groomed since birth as the newest blades of the Empire. They all had lived their whole lives waiting to die for so glorious a cause.

All, save one.

He shouted and clamored with the rest of them, but his eyes were cold, and hard.

"Even now, we prepare the *hostia* at Aquilus*.* The finest warriors of the *gladiātōrēs* are being brought to our temple there, and with their blood, we shall curry the favor of Mars!"

Yet more cheers.

*'Yet more blood,'* thought the dissenter in their midst.

"But the preparations are not yet complete. We need not merely the blood of our slaves, but the blood of our *enemies!* We march north, for Mar's Path, to find gifts for our *god!*"

Turning to face *Olympus,* Gradivus points his stout blade forward and roars. Before them, a yawning crack in the mountainside stands, disappearing into the snow above, wide enough to lead an army through. A path, carved by his lord, for the newest conquest of the Empire.

CB550f question about clutch So my bike is finally up and running! but the clutch seems to slip under load (high RPMs and WOT) its kinda weird because it happens when I shift gears the clutch will slip, but if I give it a moment then it seems to engage a lot better, almost like the clutch has to catch up. I have also already adjusted the clutch, although I'm not sure if I did so correctly, I lined up the two dots on the clutch arm and used the clutch adjustment screw, then adjusted my cable afterward.  Any ideas what it could be? I am assuming that the clutch is at the end of its life, But I hope iI can get more life out of it with a better adjustment procedure.

Malacath ‘int Dung! And we iz rock solid! *The following text is transcribed from both the diary of, and interview with Grumar Gro-Lumbuz, an Orsimer smith residing in Dushnikh Yal, as of the current year, 4E 197*

- -

“an impeeral maj came to th strogold the othur day and he woz asking abowt how we waz created. and i tell him that malacath used his majic to do spells on sum rocks and coz of that we woz born. and coz of the rocks thats why orcs are reely reely strong and hav big fiting strenth.

but he lafd in my fase and told me that was a ly!!! he sed that malacath was wonz an elf naymd trimmiac, who woz serving a sirodil god cald acatosh! malacath beeyng a horty toyty elf is bad enuf, but then he had the stonz to say that trimmiac was ated by boeefiah and got turned into dung which woz was wot we are come from!

malacath int dung, coz then if he was he wud be a slimy smelly thing, and we wud too! but we iz green, dry and only a bit stinky. so i lafd in the majes fase and absolootly cloberd him

the maj is in the grond now with my good acs stuck in his head. im going to smif a new one tomorrow becoz i cant get the acs out.”

- -

The incident described in the preceeding excerpt, the murder of Callistus Alliantus, by Grumar Gro-Lumbuz was ruled as Second Degree Murder by the High Court of Markarth, and Grumar was punished accordingly. However, Enumion Tumoth, a member of the Synod was present for the trial and took great interest in Grumar’s beliefs on the Orsimer creation myth after hearing a reading of the preceeding excerpt.

The following is an interview conducted by Enumion within the confines of Cidnha Mine, transcribed by his assisstant.

- -

Enumion: “Good Afternoon, Mr. Gro-Lumbuz. I hope I’m not disturbing you today, I only have a select few questions.”

Grumar: “You are disturbing me. With your weird face and ears. And nose. I don’t get how people think I’m an elf like you.”

(Enumion audibly sighs)

Enumion: “Great, great. Pleasentries aside, I’d like to talk to you about the Orcish creation myth. Would you be able to describe it to me?”

Grumar: “Alright. So one day, there’s a really big boulder. And it’s the biggest in all of Nirn. And it decides that to show that fact off, it’s going to grow a body. And it does.”

Enumion: “I don’t see how this relates to the creation of your race.”

Grumar: “No, dolt! That rock is Malacath! And he’s the biggest rock because he’s the strongest! But the second biggest rock rolls up to him and says that now he’s changed his form, he’s no longer strongest, right?”

Enumion: “Right.”

Grumar: “And to teach the rock a lesson, since he’s wrong, obviously, Malacath grows eight arms and smashed the rock into tiny pebbles, then uses magic to turn them into the first orcs.”

Enumion: “Interesting, I assume this is an oral tradition of your tribe? On the topic of creation myths, what do you think of the Trinimac creation story?”

(Grumar swells with rage and screams indechipherably, again attempting to choke Enumion. The interview is cut short as Grumar smashes the door to his cell open, and tries to tear Enumion’s lower jaw off, before being restrained and severely beaten by several guards)

Long list of all the unrealistic absurdities I remember from watching Ajin [spoilers] This type of anime is what makes me auto-doubt any anime I start watching. I heard this one was very good, but it nukes the suspension of disbelief, I'll just highlight merely what I can remember.

First of all, as a general rule, if you find a type of being that is immortal and able to kill people at a distance, you don't take them to a lab and torture them, the reason is they are immortal and can kill at a distance. You'd clearly cooperate.

Also, the antagonist manages to gather a small group of Ajin, one of whom just happens to be a super hacker that can freaking hack the Metropolitan Police without EVER being detected.

The absurdity when the entire country is at threat with giant building blowing up and stuff, they get told exactly where and when the next attacks are going to take place, and they hire a few small groups of soldiers to counter it. Also when the pharmaceutical company was under threat, soldiers everywhere, they knew exactly the attack was about to happen, and suddenly a few people show up with two MASSIVE crates pretending to be plumbers, not suspicious at all, let them pass lmao, no bombs under there. Literally a comedy sketch.

Good guy says to one of the bad guys ''you know if you just kill everyone in massive terrorist attacks, they will just hate you instead of accepting you as citizens'', before the bad guy being like OMG YOU HAVE A POINT!!1 It seemed like it was trying to make the viewers realize they aren't necessarily good guys by blowing everyone up, and the bad guys went until the very end of season 2 before realizing it was dumb. C'mon, your viewers aren't that blind, I hope.

The anti Ajin task force thing, they talked about they had blinding lasers, special grenade launchers, super high powered electric untethered stun equipment. When deployed, they only used their rifles, iirc a single flashbang, and then all died.

You actually only see the grenade launcher later on when the bad guy was using it to take control of a seemingly mediocre army base... that for some reason has toxic gas grenade launcher things, enough to wipe out all of Japan, in a random army bunker, on like the second floor or something. Wot? Turns out these are particularly dangerous to Japan because these are short range ones. Ok, why would Japan ever need that many ''short range'' gas launcher things, how can a single army base have that many and how can a small terrorist group of like 5 people with a van effectively claim them all?

Also, with these gas launchers, you have nerve gas that can create a cloud that will completely incapacitate the bad guys by keeping them in a permanent state of death, they are short range, and you don't think of using them? Oh probably because it was said the army hasn't been given the authority to use anything but standard weaponry which is why they got taken over so easily, while the entire Japanese population is under threat, while this mediocre standard weaponized army base has enough nerve gas to wipe out all of Japan just chilling out on the second floor.

The US army near the end decides to gas a ridiculously big area to kill the bad guy, they couldn't evacuate the citizens cos the bad guy would know, and would retaliate by doing I have no idea what. Couldn't they just like... I dunno, throw a bunch of gas grenades at them? They go the entire 2 seasons before considering gas, and they only consider it by gassing an entire small city or something iirc.

How does everybody mysteriously have infinite bullets?

The antagonist says he will take over Japan, the population has... THREE DAYS to evacuate. I think 30 years would be more reasonable tbh.

There's a random government ''city'' building with a load of nukes in the basement, and there is nothing but a single keycard needed to open the door to them. Imagine if the nukes ever needed to be handled in any way, just carry them out into the streets and load them onto a truck on pallets and drive them off, no biggie.

What blows my mind the most is the ending. They are in the sewers, which clearly aren't the sewers, looks more like a giant transport tunnel system. The good guys deke out the bad guys a significant distance from where they were, minutes of running from around the corner then blow the roof on him. But it's ok because the bad cleverly had planted bombs freaking everywhere underneath them (tunnels under the city tunnels?), so they somehow get crushed by the ceiling, fall through the floor, aaand nobody is trapped by any rubble anymore because the bad guys plan was foolproof. The girl after this wakes up and looks up and sees she's like 9 feet below the surface (wtf?).

The bad guy gets his head cut off which for the majority of the film was the only way to kill an Ajin (it's the point of there being a main threat to the good Ajin), but then revives unharmed. PLAY BY YOUR OWN RULES ANIME!!!

The antagonist gets taken away on a helicopter, he wakes up mid-flight because the Yanks were daft enough to forget that the tranquilizers are temporary, then the bad guy I guess uses his power and blows up the helicopter and is free. Apparently using general anaesthesia to keep him asleep never crossed their minds.

Naughty bad anime, pls stop!

The Sperging Spudboy I'm new to making posts/greentexts so forgive my spudness. This took place a week or two ago but feels like yesterday

&gt;Be me
&gt;8th Grade
&gt;School does good job of keeping spuds under control
&gt;Few spuds even are allowed in regular classes
&gt;One of these spuds is in my class
&gt;let's call him Anthony
&gt; Anthony has mild autism and extreme aspergers
&gt;In gym class with him, playing kickball with my buds when the teacher forces us to let him play with us
&gt;ends up on my team
&gt;game is uneventful for it's entirety until we lose
&gt; after game I think it'd be a good idea to give Anthony some advice on how to play kickball a bit better
&gt; I was wrong
&gt; Walk over and begin telling him how to play better
&gt;He takes it as an insult and begins freaking out and REEing with the power of the tard gods on his side to boost his REEs as if he had a megahorn
&gt;Me and my buds tell him to "calm the fuck down"
&gt;Bad idea
&gt;He feels the need to start running up and down the hallway, still REEing
&gt;At this point, I'm tired of his shit, so tell Anthony to just fuck off
&gt;The tiny lightbulb in his head that powers him is beginning to flicker with thought
&gt; He thinks it's good idea to begin threatening to fight me
&gt;u Wot m8?
&gt;Anthony is skinny as a twig and I, although not buff, am still a big boy that can pack a punch
&gt;I'm extremely annoyed so I tell Anthony to "back off before I beat the shit out off him"
&gt; He dares me to swing, which was retarded of him, but then again he was imbued with the 'tisms
&gt;I turn around and deliver a right hook that should have killed him but only knocked him unconcious
&gt;Several kids are in awe
&gt;Tard Gard is waddling her fat ass over
&gt;ohshit.jpg
&gt; I end up only getting a week of student work center detention(basically work on regular stuff but in front off a teacher for the entire day) because tard picked fights with other kids and my buds had my back
&gt; Don't regret it one bit because tard's parents took tard out of school and I never need to see him ever again


How did I do? I have more stories I may post in the future

First boat and first time out on the water! Hey all! I just wanted to share about our first time out on the water! I'm sure we didn't do everything correctly but we learned things and now we can't wait to do it again.

We just bought a new boat (2018 Duckworth 18' 7") with a 90 HP 4 stroke Yamaha.

Things we learned:

1. Shallow water sucks :P We dinged up the prop pretty good (see my other posts) but I guess these things happen, and while it was a bit scary it wasn't too expensive of a lesson. We're still learning the water ways around here and they are a bit low right now anyways. We were in a small connecting river to the Columbia and the water went from about 6 feet to 2 feet in a hurry and we probably went through some river rock. Ouch!
1. Backing up a trailer is hard! People were nice tho and even tho it was busy at the ramp yesterday (Fathers day) people were full of encouragement, and a couple of tips. I just kept at it and would pull forward to get it straight when I got to turned up, or too close to the dock or the bushes on the other side.
1. Getting the boat back on, more difficult than it looks. We are not yet ready to try and power load it, and I think I went a bit too deep with the trailer, but got it on enough that when I pulled forward I could use the wench to pull it the rest of the way on the trailer.

We followed the instructions to break in the new motor, we were careful for the first hour to only go about half throttle, and then the 2nd hour fast enough to get it on plane (at least I think it was on plane, I'm not 100% sure how to tell when it is on plane). I was told that after the first two hours to take it to WOT but only for short periods of time. At WOT the dealer said it should go to about 6000 RPM but we only got to about 5200 RPM, so I'm wondering if that is normal or not.

I bought a new prop to replace the dinged up one and also bought a skeg guard to install to protect it, since we are near some shallow river water.

Big thanks to everyone who answered my prop questions, and those who answered some questions about buying a boat in the first place!

Next time I might even try using the anchor! I'm a bit nervous, and I'm not sure why but getting on the bow and dropping it and all that seems a bit sketchy. Also I gotta figure out the Lowrance Elite 7 TI. Baby steps! I'd really like it if I can figure out how to see on the maps the shallower water, and maybe alert me in time if there is shallower water.

How do others manage a crash and burn after diagnosis? TL:DR at end. Advice/comparisons/hugs/you are absolutely a dumbass comments all very welcome.

-----------------------------

Diagnosed fairly recently after multiple friends/partners suggesting I go for an assessment. Surprise! Super fucking obvious ADHD. I mean no shit sherlock but you know. I was fine for the first wee bit, some anger at the 'if only this had been diagnosed sooner' bit but I have my coping mechanisms for that and was generally okay.

I live in the UK and saw a private practitioner after my NHS referral was firstly met with 'everyone procrastinates' (U wot m8?) and the second referral was downright refused because there was nothing else they could do to help me. I absolutely hit the wall. My shit is still packed in boxes to go to the charity shop after I offed myself. Because lol I had the motivation to die but nothing after living was a possibility after all. I stirred my baked beans with a piece of cardboard yesterday cause I haven't got round to unpacking the utensils.

So I made the appointment and booked an assessment, cause money or not I knew if I didn't I was done. And honestly, that assessment was fucking awesome. It was stressful as shit and the whole fucking time I was telling myself not to freak inside my head, but fuck me it was so nice to have someone who seemed to genuinely listen to me. Announcing that yes, I did very much meet the clinical criteria for ADHD and was not just imagining everything was the cherry on top of the shit sandwich. Also he let me swear in his office. Fucking fabulous, because I generally have a gob on me and only tame it around complete strangers, medical professionals and children. If I have to censor my speech inside a psych office, you're not going to get honest thoughts out of me.

So, the problem.

I am skint. Really broke. I looked into it recently and it's even worse than I thought because of course it is because of course I just plain forgot about some debt from my dumbass decisions and insane care costs. So the plan is to hopefully get the NHS to cover the cost of my prescriptions while I see my private CNP for checkups and medication tweaks and shit.

I, for who knows what reason, have completely lost my shit at this. There have been some medical mishaps in the past - highly unethical disclosures of information, major misdiagnoses that affected medical care, general ignorance that bit me in the arse later down the line - but nothing I would have been prepared to hit me like this.

I guess I'm worried that my GP/PCP will be pissy I've gone 'behind their back' as it were? I did not tell them I was seeing someone privately and can't see it being taken well. I have a whole lot of other medical problems and GPs coordinate your care, I cannot afford for them to be pissed at me. I did have good reason for not telling them, I knew that if they showed the slightest hint that they didn't approve I'd bottle it...and then kill myself. Not a great plan.

So I know, logically, that this was a good decision. I know, logically, that I did the right thing. I know, logically, that my self preservation is more important than any minor peeve that my GP may have, and that they would much rather I stay breathing and a thorn in their side. And I know that it's just as possible that they'll say righty-ho, write in the prescription and not think about me again.

But my magical logic armour is not working for once and I'm fucking losing it.

I've started having major nightmares and fecking flashbacks again. A couple have been related to the actual diagnosis but most have been related to past shit - childhood/adult domestic abuse, rape, homelessness, medical problems, the usual shite. I'm assuming this is just because of general psych crap being stirred up but it will not go back in its box where it belongs like it usually does. If anyone has suggestions for dealing with this so I can get some fucking sleep without dreaming my CNP is murdering me, I would greatly appreciate it. Especially cause he's actually really nice and that makes me feel even worse.

I've gone back to my old 'bottle-of-gin-a-night' habit which is a massive concern. I don't keep alcohol in the house because I KNOW I have no self control and will impulsively drink it all. I've been going out and buying it the last couple of nights. I know it's a problem. I don't know how to deal with it. My whole sleep hygiene, chamomile tea, OTC-sleeping-med-if-you're-really-stuck thing is not working right now.

I don't know who I can go to because the NHS has written me off for this particular issue. Given their previous response to my now diagnosed condition, I don't even know if they would take it seriously.

I don't even know what the panic is about. If I can't be prescribed medication on the NHS I'll get it privately, money or not. I don't have any fucking money but debt for medication is acceptable right? Americans do it all the time. I know that I will get the meds and see if they work, that's not a concern. So why the FUCK is my brain losing its shit?

I haven't slept for three days and am only coping by doing excessive amounts of exercise, drinking way too much and listening to a lot of angry music. I don't know what the fuck to do. I know I'm in a really bad place. I don't know how to fix it.

--------------------------

TL;DR - How many of you bellends skipped right here? Got dx, fine with dx, now struggling with concerns about medication, flashbacks to previous issues and hugely destructive coping mechanisms. Don't know how to deal, help not expected but greatly appreciated. Cheers.

The Patient Farmer This story begins almost 10 years ago now, in a quiet(ish) town in the Midlands, UK.

My best friend and I were out for her 19th birthday in one of the town’s 2 clubs. This one was known for being the less seedy of the two. My friend ‘Marilyn’ had been planning this for weeks – she had her sights set on one of the promoters and it was her mission to seduce him for her birthday. I, however, had no interest in these small-town folk. I was crushing on someone at my university about 30 minutes’ drive away (relevant later).

Being a 5’3” chubby lass, I didn’t really get too much attention unless someone was feeling particularly bold or drunk. Marilyn was off draping over her promoter while I hung around in the smoking area alone, and I was targeted by a bizarre looking gentleman. He was around 6’5”, built like a brick shithouse, and had a real Cro-Magnon look about him.

He was slurring his speech a little, so I thought perhaps he was drunk at first. Trying to be polite despite my discomfort with his predatory glare, I engaged in light conversation. His name was ‘Thomas Pence’ and he is a farmer from down the way there. His farmhouse is by the Post Office and his land is all the fields and woodland behind the town. He’s 28 years old (I tell him I’m 18). He’s got a cat called Fluffins and it’s black and white. It eats micies. It leaves them on the door.

The more I heard him talk, I realised he wasn’t drunk, but not very well educated – not in a judgemental way, but it was clear his speech and general knowledge were lacking. I felt less threatened by this Hulk of a man that was looking at me intensely and asked him more about his cat. He was totally fixated on telling me about the cattle slaughters and how blood clots. How the cow’s blood rushes out and clots into dinner plate sized dark jelly clots… Red flag. Real bright red flag right in my face.

I say I’m feeling cold and need to go back in to find my friend as it’s her birthday and I shouldn’t leave her alone. As I move off he grabs me and sits me into his lap. Hard. His enormous hand is wrapped right around my upper arm and I can’t really move. I look over at Marilyn with panic on my face, and she gives me double thumbs up and a big smile. She’s thinking “hooray – she’s pulled!”

I tell him I have to go to my friend and to please let me go. He looks me dead in the eyes and says, “Marilyn is happy for you.” Red fucking flag. I never once said her name to him. I hadn’t seen, heard of or noticed him until he approached me outside, even though he was a giant. I tell him to let me go or I’ll scream. He squeezed my chest with his free hand and forcibly kissed me before throwing me off his lap. Yuck.

I try to disappear into the crowd and circle back around to get Marilyn who wants to know who he is, whether I got his number, is he nice? So she doesn’t know him either, but he knows her name… Is he watching us? Has he been following me? I say, no number, no interest. I just want to go home.

Marilyn wants 10 minutes to solidify her hook up with promotor-man, so I tell her to meet me in the ladies and we’ll go home from there. Figured that was a safe enough hiding place.

Now. Marilyn has done me wrong before with her drunken ways. I had previously been targeted by a man that called himself ‘Rock’ and he aggressively pursued me for my number. I gave him a fake one, he found out and Marilyn gave him my real one while I was getting another drink… So when she came into the bathroom and I could see Thomas leering just outside the door, I knew what she had done. Very uncool.

It was her birthday and she was so sure she’d done me a favour, I couldn’t crush her lovely evening. I checked my phone and there was one message. “Mayb ur blod is sweat x x x x x x” Maybe my blood is sweet?! MAYBE MY BLOOD IS SWEET?! WHAT THE HECK.

“It Tom cum owt tha loo x x x x x x x x”

I decide with Marilyn that our best bet is to leave hastily and get in a taxi. Our original plan was to walk to my Mum’s about a 30-minute walk away, but that somehow didn’t feel safe anymore.

“Wer u go fugnugget x x x x x”

“U gon wot I do x x x”

“U can run but I got u now”

I was *shook*. I couldn’t sleep. I felt safe enough with Marilyn, the dog and being locked in. But I just couldn’t rest. I walked the dog, Marilyn went home, I scoped out the road I lived on and the coast was clear. So I set off to go to my uni house. I make the 30 minute drive in 16 minutes and dash into the house to tell my housemates about this nutter.

“Wer u goin u live in [specific district of town where my Mum lives] x x x”

“Is fugnugget ur rele nam x x x x x”

“U shd slw don”

My female housemate decided it would be a good idea to see if he’s on Facebook. We searched ‘Thomas Pence’ and filtered by town… There he was. Giant-headed, gormless profile picture, nothing set to private. He’d added 74 women called “fug nug”. I rang Marilyn and she said that she only gave him my first name (which is double-barrelled) and he must think that’s my full name. Blocked him, spoke to my tutor at uni, rang the police who said they couldn’t do anything just keep the messages. Useless.

I missed a week of lectures, I stayed inside, my housemates did my shopping for me. I stayed in for all of reading week, and decided that a fortnight would be long enough. The messages coming through were nondescript, sometimes just a series of “x x x x x” or “U so beatful” and they had slowed down enough for me not to have anxiety when I heard a phone vibrate. I hadn’t had a message for 2 days at this point.

I put on black jogging bottoms and a black hoody and left in the dead of night on a Sunday to get some food from the 24 hour Tesco thinking it would ease me back into society.

“U lok nace 2nat x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x”

“U lok lik a robber”

I’m alone, in a dark car park and freaking out. I call the store and ask them to send a security guard to me because I’m being followed. They sent both guards when they heard what a state I was and took me inside and told me to turn my phone off. I stayed there for 4 hours and they monitored the CCTV for this blonde haired giant, but nothing. We turned my phone back on to 72 missed calls and 29 text messages, the more interesting of which were:

“I luv u cum c me x x x x x x x”

“Wer u hidin x x x x”

“Com out now or els”

“I wayt 4 2 weks 4 u x x x”

“Fuk u den I luvd u”

That was enough to go to the Police with, and I made a report the following day. They couldn’t find him, and he wasn’t at home. He actually didn’t show up at his home for another 3 days. When he did, he had a new phone and tried to say he had a twin brother (which they knew wasn’t true). They called the number that was harassing me and it rang in the drawer.

He called me the moment the police left him to threaten me for breaking his heart, although their visit seemed to have dissuaded him. I moved away 1 month later and I’m just glad he doesn't have my full name so he can't find me.

So, ‘Thomas’. Let’s not meet. Ever again.
(Names changed, of course.)

The Oath Of Mars, Part 3: Caedo Hello, brave readers! The prologue is over! In the frozen heights of the southern Mountains, the Rose Legion encounters a mysterious enemy.

[You can find the fanfiction.net link here, if you'd like to follow it or leave a review!](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12970260/3/The-Oath-Of-Mars)

As always, constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated, and I hope you enjoy...

**~~--------------------------------------------------~~**

**The Oath Of Mars, Part 3: Caedo**

**~~--------------------------------------------------~~**

Marius thinks to himself that he prefers Valkenheim to the skyrakers. At least Valkenheim was cold and *flat,* and you knew what was trying to kill you. The warhorses of the Lawbringers were bred to navigate every sort of terrain you might find, in ashfeld and beyond, but even Lamri was having trouble surmounting the great snowy slopes of the southern highlands. They had to abandon the wagons a short while ago, but thankfully, the battleground was not far off.

"Doesn't it seem odd?"

Jumping, knocked from his own thoughts by the voice, he looks down. Oh no.

Elizabeth.

"...What?"

"That whoever's causing trouble here would trudge through such a snow-blighted wasteland as this just to stab a few farmers. Why are they doing it?"

"I don't know."

"Ah. Perhaps they're xenophobic. They see a culture asides from their own, they're obliged to conquer it. Remind you of someone?"

"I feel I should note that I've trained Lamri to kick on command."

"Fine! Sorry..."

"That... was easy. No holier-than-thou philisophical tirade?"

"No..."

Silence.

"Can I... ride the horse?"

*"No."*

"There's space enough for two people Marius, I'm not asking you to get-"

*"No."*

"Come **on**, Marius, my legs are about to fall off with all this climbing!"

*"Then drag yourself with your hands,* ***wench.****"*

*"Why you-! You!- ...Gh!"*

And a snowball hits the back of his helmet.

"Lamri! Kick! Kick!"

Lamri does not kick. She has not been trained to kick on command.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

They had been marching for a long, long time. The sun had rose and fell, only to rise once more, and all that time they had been in the dark, with only torchlight and the occasional lava flow to show the way.

But now? Far off in the distance, daylight.

The other side. The new world.

Mars Gradivus smiles.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

At long last, the ground mercifully leveled out. Gasping in relief, Elizabeth lies face first in the flat, powdery snow.

"That's a good way to freeze to death, or at least get sick."

"If I do, it's *your* fault, you soulless case of metal!"

"Don't say I didn't warn you."

He looks away from the exhausted assassin, back ahead. In the distance, he can see a shattered pole, with a flag attached, frozen stiff and straight, as if locked in time, mid-gust of wind. A shield with three roses emblazoned upon it lay on a field of pink. The standards of the Rose Legion.

"We're here. See what you can find while we set up camp. I want a report by nightfall."

Stepping down from his steed, he walks past the Peacekeeper wordlessly. Approaching his horse, the Peacekeeper whispers harshly.

***"Your owner's a rat bastard, horse."***

Lamri whinnies obliviously.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

"So, what have you found, milady?"

"What? Oh, nothing, so far. Everything's been buried by the snow. Assuming there was anything to find in the first place."

The peacekeeper sighs in frustration, leaning away from the little dig she had started, and wrapped her arms around herself.

"Bring that torch closer, would you? This cloak only does so much."

The warden crouches beside her, holding the flame close.

"Marius was right; no bodies, ours or theirs. At least, so far. I've found patches of blood here and there, but that hardly tells us anything."

"Well, what about the cultures of the south? Anything in your studies about a society that takes the corpses of their enemies?"

"No. Whoever did this, their society has changed since the cataclysm."

"Changed?"

"Cultures aren't set in stone, my dear. Just look at Publius' journal. We've changed very much since the fall of the Empire, haven't we? And even before that, the Empire was radically different from the pre-cataclysm society of the region, which resembled ours, instead taking on the image of an even older civilization that pre-dated *that* one."

"So, like a game of leap frog? Empire, Legion, Empire, Legion?"

"More or less. We aren't the only one's who've changed. The warriors of Valkenheim weren't always so fanatically devoted to their gods. They wore armor, like we did, but now their 'Raiders' rely on the favor of Odin as their only defense. And the Chosen wore metal armor before arriving to the Mire. The lack of meaningfully large metal deposits and abundance of strong trees forced them into making their armor out of wood instead. The Cataclysm changed everything, for everyone."

"...Where do you think we'd be, if it hadn't happened?"

"I can't even begin to imagine. It's been 800 years. A civilization rose from nothing and fell to the same since then, with enough time left over for us to forget about it."

Sighing, she leans back, away from the slowly widening hole, and sits down.

\-And promptly jumps back up with a shout.

*"Good god!"*

"What is it!?"

Whirling around, the peacekeeper starts digging at the snow.

"Something stabbed me!"

Fishing the offending point from the snow, she holds the mysterious object in her hands. A dagger, coated in frozen blood, with a handle made of antler seared black, and a wide, thick blade. She knew what this was.

It was a bloody *pugio*, a type of ancient fighting knife.

A type of ancient fighting knife that was used by the Empire.

But this? This was newly made. The blade was made of steel, not plain iron or bronze. As if in reply to her confusion, far off in the distance, a horn sounded.

Nervously, the Warden draws her sword.

"Did you hear that? What do you think it is?"

Following suit, the Peacekeeper unsheathes her twin blades.

"Knowing our luck, trouble."

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

*"Futuo!"*

Putting the horn to his lips, the lightly armored scout blows as hard as he can, sending the tone echoing through the mountains. His hiding place exposed, he attempts to flee-

\-Only for a metal gauntlet to pin him to the tree trunk he had been crouched behind.

***"WHO ARE YOU?"***

Marius wrapped his hands around the strange soldiers throat. He was cloaked in a suit of iron scales, and at one hip lay a sword curved outwards, and at the other was a short, but wide-bladed dagger. He had never seen anything like it.

But that didn't matter right now.

***"WHERE ARE MY MEN?"***

*"Peri,* *catamitus!"*

Unsheathing the shorter blade, he attempts to plunge it into the metalclad man, but he simply rips the blade from his hands with one of his own. Headbutting him with his helmet, the scout collapses to his knees- the perfect height for Marius to drive his own armored knee into his face. Hauling him to his feet by his hair, the Lawbringer pins him back against the tree. Now in Latin, Marius roars.

***"WRONG ANSWER! WHERE?!"***

Spitting in his face, the beaten scout laughs defiantly.

*"I know your tongue, dog!* *Do not sully Mars' own with your foul breath!"*

"Mars?"

That moment of confusion, both from the realization that their enemies spoke the same tongue as they and from this talk of someone named Mars, was what the scout was looking for. Bracing his back against the tree, he pushes the Lawbringer away with his legs and draws his *falcatta.*

Taking his halberd in both hands, he levels it at the soldier as he charges. Deflecting the scout's stab with the shaft of his weapon, the blade lodges itself in the tree behind him, and, winding the axe back, he cleaves the mysterious assailants head from his shoulders. Wordlessly, he pulls the *falcatta* from the tree and puts it through his belt. Maybe Elizabeth could tell him where this sword was from.

But he had to hurry. The man at his feet had sounded the horn. Who knew what kind of reinforcements it would bring?

He whistled for Lamri.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

Gradivus honed his gladius with slow strokes, wearing away the scratches and scrapes of previous battles. He and his camp stood at the mouth of Mars' Path, the colossal rift in the mountainside that linked Empire and Legion. The scouts had been deployed, charged with combing the lowlands to the south for prospective sacrafices.

As it were, they didn't have to travel far. A horn, sounded, far below. The camp became charged with an unidentifiable energy, soldiers dropping their tasks, looking to their master. Awaiting orders.

Wordlessly, he sheathed his sword, donning the bearded mask of Creta, the sign of his office.

And then, he marched, *centuria* following behind.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

Garth kept his eyes forward, head tucked behind his shield, men at arms to his sides. That had been a signal horn, some minutes ago. And the pattern it blew was no order he recognized. He and the less experienced soldiers under his supervision were beating a careful retreat back to the battlegrounds, shields raised and ready for ambush.

He heard crunching snow behind him. Whirling around, flail spinning over his head, he prepared to strike-

Only to see Elizabeth and her Warden companion.

"Christ! It's you! Don't you ever announce yourself?!"

The Peacekeeper claps him on the shoulders.

"Garth, I think I have a theory as to who we're up against, but it's a wild one."

"Wot?"

Stepping past him, she looks around.

"Where's Marius?"

"He went west on that big bear-horse a' his! We split up so we could cover more ground!"

"*Are you kidding me?* Since when has *'splitting up'* ever been a good idea?!"

"Wait wait wait! What's this *'theory'* a' yours?!"

She looks like she's about to respond, but *someone* interrupted her.

"You... speak the *Lingua Plebis?*"

The party, distracted by one another, whirls to face the unknown voice.

Before them stood perhaps the largest man Elizabeth had ever seen. The towering figure would put even the Raiders of Valkenheim to shame, and this one was wearing armor. More specifically, a muscle cuirass, a fitted breastplate hammered into the shape of a well-defined torso, black iron accented with gold. A helmet, styled into the image of a bearded man's face, concealed his true visage. At his hip was a short, stout blade, designed for thrusting attacks.

A *gladius*. Signature weapon of the old Empire.

Anna levels her sword at the mysterious soldier.

"Who are you?!"

Elizabeth steps forward, past the rest, placing herself between the masked man and the rest of her party.

"I know who you are."

She thinks back to Publius' Journal. After they won, the rebels didn't *execute* the loyalists. Just sent them away.

"You're the *Empire*. After the civil war, the surviving loyalists were exiled. It's been centuries... but you've returned."

The centurion is silent for a moment, no visible reaction to her words. But when he does speak, the words surprise her.

"Return...? Exile? This is not our home."

The peacekeeper was confused. So this wasn't an attempt at reclaiming their homeland?

"Wait, you *don't-*"

He steps forward, and the peacekeeper readies her blades.

"Enough talk. What you think we are does not matter. This is all you need to know."

He unsheathes his gladius, a shaft of black metal like a piece of midnight.

"I am Mars Gradivus."

He points the sword at her, razor tip leveled at her heart.

"And I am your opponent."

He was fast. Faster than any man his size ought to be. In an instant, he was upon her.

*"Milady!"*

Stopping the black blade, just barely, with her own sword, she staggers back under his strength, the sheer force of his downwards stab alone threatening to send her to the ground. Releasing one hand from his iron fisted grip on the sword's hilt, he smashes it into her iron face mask. The thick metal gauntlet gave his fist the crushing power of a mace, sending her flying back, unconscious.

The two men at arms charge, swords raised. Blocking one blade with his sword and the other with the heavy metal gauntlet on his other arm, he kicks one away and backhands the other. Raising the sword for another strike, the one closest lunges forward. Catching the blade with his armor-clad hand, he brings the pommel of his gladius into the flat of the sword, snapping the cheap blade clean in two. Flipping both his Gladius and the latter half of the soldier's sword into a reverse grip, he hooks the shield of the disarmed knight with his blade and pulls it aside, giving him the opening he needed to slam the other half of the knight's own into his neck. Leaving the broken sword in his slain opponent, Gradivus pounces on the other. The man-at-arms raises his shield, but, putting all of his strength behind his blade, the Aspect of Mars simply hammers it right through, nailing the soldier's own shield to his chest like a plank of wood.

**"YOU RAT SON OF A BITCH!"**

With a cry of fury, Garth whirls his flail above his head, building momentum. Swinging it in a crushing overhead arc, he strikes at the centurion. Blade still lodged in the soldier, Gradivus is forced backwards, abandoning his weapon. Unphased, he puts his armored, *cestus*\-clad fists up at the ready. Deflecting a strike from the whirling flail with one gauntlet, he pulls his shield aside with the other and drives his knee into the Conqueror's gut. Bringing one fist back, he prepares to strike- only to be tackled by the Warden, sending him staggering back.

Breathing heavily, Garth keeps his shield up. Anna readies herself for more.

But it doesn't come.

"...Pathetic. I should hope the rest of you provide better fare."

He cracks his neck, and then his knuckles. Stretching, he sighs.

"Mars would hardly gain from the blood of barbarians so bereft of skill. But it shall have to do. The *hostia* must be completed."

He points at the Warden.

"You. At least you landed a blow, if not with your weapon. Perhaps you'll perform more aptly outside of an ambush? The arena may suit you better..."

"Do you think you'll take us, fiend?! You are without weapons! Surrender!"

Looking around, Gradivus opens his arms wide.

"Oh? Am I? It seems my voice serves me better than my fists."

"Wha-?"

Someone kicks her in the back of the knees. Dropping to the ground, her assailant puts a dagger- the same kind of dagger lady Elizabeth found- to her neck.

"Excellent work, Ultor."

A lightly armored soldier, cloaked in gilded scales, held the blade to her neck. At his hip was a falcatta, and the sheath of the dagger he now wielded.

"Only with so fine a distraction was it possible, my lord."

"Let her go, ye bastards!"

He raises his flail, but Ultor only presses the blade further into her neck. Gradivus strides forward, ripping his sword from the dead legionnaire.

"You will live yet, as prisoners. The *hostia* will not be complete without you. But we can afford to sacrifice one of you here and now. Be still... *slave.*"

Gradivus, now just behind Garth, who was still turned to his captured companion, wraps an arm around the Conqueror's neck, muscles flexing to cut off the flow of blood to his brain. Letting him drop after several seconds in the sleeper hold, unconscious, Gradivus removes Anna's helmet, and nods. Unsheathing his other blade, Mars Ultor brings the butt of the *falcatta* down onto her bare scalp, and the world goes black.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

Gradivus sat in his tent, some hours later. The company had been divided into small squadrons, to better comb the frozen woods. They had never expected to find an organized fighting force, it seems. The carts were loaded, the prisoners shackled, the bodies burned and bones ground.

But something troubled him.

He had combed through the prisoners, looking. He had sifted through the bodies. The ridge of horsehair atop his *galea* marked him as the leader of his *centuria*. Most enemies he had faced had similar embellishments- armor adorned with certain colors or embellishments such as feathers. But none of the prisoner's -nor the corpses- bore any emblem of their position.

So, the question remains; Where was their leader?

Gradivus would find his answer soon, as a scream erupted from outside.

**~~----------------------------------------~~**

He swung his halberd in a wide arc from atop his armored warhorse, sending the nearest invader flying into the silken outer walls of a purple tent. He slumped down against the partition, staining the fine cloth red with his life's blood.

***"I AM MARIUS GAIUS FLAVIUS, LORD COMMANDER OF THE ROSE LEGION! LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS AND SURRENDER MY MEN TO ME, OR DECLARE YOUR LIFE FORFEIT!"***

The effect was not dissimilar to kicking an anthill. Night falling, and the Imperial forces not expecting a man in full platemail to charge into the middle of their camp and strike a man down, scrambled for their weapons, shouting curses in Latin.

All save one. One man, armor ornamented and gilt in precious metals, stepped out from his tent -the purple one Marius had just now sullied- and drew his Gladius. He bore a band of horsehair atop his helmet.

***"YOU! Do you lead this band?! I demand that you explain yourself!"***

"...Your are most brave, to walk without allies into the lion's den! Such valour!"

Throwing his arms wide, he laughed, looking to the sky.

"Surely, such an offering would sate you, my lord!"

**"I care not for your meaningless words!** ***Give me my men!*****"**

Readying himself, he stares down the armorclad man and his colossal steed.

"If you so desire the liberation of your men, then I bid you fight to claim it with your life!"

Raising his Gladius, he bellows his orders.

*"Take him breathing, my sons!"*

Digging his heels into Lamri's sides, the horse breaks into a gallop, Marius' poleaxe leveled like a lance. The Imperials, regaining their wits, charged in turn.

My Little Brother's Reactions To Volume 5, Chapters 1-5 Heyo!

So, this is stupid late, because I just found the notepad document I saved his comments in like, yesterday. Since people got a good laugh out of what he had to say last Volume, I figured I'd throw together his more... out there comments from this time around as well.

Enjoy!

----------------------------------------

**Chapter 1:**

*[Volume’s first line: “The city of Mistral”]*: Minstral? ~~I’m going to kill this child~~

*[Ruby’s “We were fine”]*: Ruby, I don’t like your definition of ‘fine’...

*[“This is awesome!”]*: In glorious TWO-D!

*[“And we are going up!”]*: Elevator, goooooing up. DING! First floor, scene transition.

*[Airship establishing shot]*: Did an F22 just go past the camera, *jesus*!

*[Pilot boi]*: It looks like he’s wearing a suit. ~~He isn’t.~~ I said it *looks like it*!

*[“But… they’ll die”]*: Sucks t’ suck, Weiss.

*[Establishing shots of Haven]*: Ooh, that’s purty. I’d go here. I want to go here. Can I go here?

*[Ruby wiping away a tear]*: (really excitedly) Subtle character momeeeeeent!

*[Qrow looking wary]*: My alcoholism senses are tingling.

*[Qrow kicking in the door; subsequent reaction shots]*: Oh my fucking god I love this show

*[“You need better security”]*: It’s *lizard girl!* ~~Ilia.~~ LIZARD GIRL!

*[“Just leave Menagerie before it’s too late”]*: At this point, I’m insulted *for* them at that choice of name.

*[Ruby’s wince]*: More subtle character moments!

*[Lionheart mentioning Atlas]*: (giggling) Ironwood. ~~Oh, fuck off.~~ No! I will *not* let that go!

*[Qrow knocking the books off the desk]*: No one, uh... no one told Vic to yell louder, did they? ~~No, they did not.~~ (sigh)

*[Talking about Raven]*: I'm hedging a bet. ~~Yes?~~ Raven's the Spring Maiden. ~~(I swear to god, I didn't say a word. He figured it out by himself.)~~

*[Cinder's transcripts being forged]*: Well, if that isn't ironic. ~~Thanks, Tyrian.~~

He went on a bit of a ramble about the end credits scene being reused, but I didn't catch most of it. It was... um... perplexed?

*[Yang's first scene of the Volume]*: YAAAAANG! Oh my god, it's best girl!

*["And a beauty at that"]*: Fuck 'im up, Yang.

*[Bandit almost touches Yang's hair]*: You are in *so* much shit now, boy!

*[Seeing the Lancers]*: Are those *Wasp* Grimm? That is a whole *new* level of fucking NOPE

*["Officially, no. Actually, yes."]*: I love pilot boi.

His only comments during the fight were Kara's efforts sounding really weird, the motion being stiff, and the music being incredible.

*[Ship crashes]*: Pilot boi! Nooooo! ~~You know he was barely a character, right?~~ (dramatically saluting) You will be missed, sassy disposable side character.

*[Sienna's death]*: BUT I LIKED HER!

*[Hazel's comment about it being unnecessary]*: I still like him. He's cool.

*[Weiss getting knocked out]*: Oh, in da face! No Aura for you.

**Chapter 3:**

*[Ozpin]*: (he literally fell off his chair) THE FUCK?!

*["I'm sorry"]*: IS THAT SHANNON MCCORMICK? *AND* AARON DISMUKE? ~~Yes?~~ THAT'S AWESOME!

*[Ozpin explaining his curse]*: Oooh, I just wanna give Ozpin a hug...

*[Vernal's introduction]*: Fuck that character design.

*[Nora's "Little cute boy Ozpin"]*: Nora is the embodiment of perfection. ~~Yes, yes she is.~~

*["But you're still lacking in hand-to-hand"]*: (very sarcastically) Oh no, a character flaw, whatever shall we do?

*[RNJR's mixed startled expressions, then just Nora]*: Basically Nora at this point, 'You fokin wot mate?'

*[Weiss summoning]*: Get yourself someone who looks at you the same way Weiss looks at that knight. ~~Isn't she cute?~~ She's freakin' adorable, man.

**Chapter 4:**

*[Yang's fight]*: This. This is awesome. This kicks ass. I want more of this.

*[Ruby and Oscar's training]*: These two are dorks. ~~And you love them.~~ And I *ship* them. Loving them is implied.

*[Ozpin taking over]*: Oh, Ruby, you are about to get your ass *whooped*.

*[Jeff's popsy piano kicks in]*: What is this music? ~~You think it's bad?~~ Different. Not bad.

*[Yang walking into the bandit camp]*: And suddenly, RWBY's a Western.

*[Tent falls; Yang sees Weiss]* Oh heeeeeey.

*["You kidnapped her?!]*: Please give us a fight, please give us a fight, please give us a fight- *[Vernal lightning]* OH GOD DAMMIT!

*["You two, in my tent, now."]*: Kinky. ~~Please stop...~~

*[Yang and Weiss hug]*: Best.

**Chapter 5:**

*[Blake calling for signatures]*: Make America great again! ~~No. Just no.~~

*[Conversation at the boardwalks]*: This is actually really nice. ~~Do you ship them too?~~ Duh!

*[Blake talking about herself in Volume 1 and 2]*: Yo, but Arryn's VA work though.

*["You'll be combat ready in no time!"]*: OW MY HEART

*["This must be really hard on her too,"]*: Can we *please* get some actual Ruby development? Please?

*[Ilia, Corrsac and Fennic's conversation]*: Who's Ilia's voice actress? ~~Cherami Leigh.~~ I *really* like her.

*[Adam's "I have a promise to keep"]*: OH FUCK, that's from Volume 3, boy! (I laughed) DO THEY DIE?! ~~You'll have to watch and find out.~~ I hate you.

My review of a 2010 Porsche 911 Turbo VS. a 2017 C7 Grandsport So last week I posted a topic about me renting a 2008 Audi R8 and comparing it to my C7 Grand Sport. My car was still in the shop getting so I decided to rent a 2010 Porsche 911 Turbo for the weekend.

I'll start off by saying that Porsche is obviously a highly regarded car company and just about every review that I watched of one has the reviewer giving the vehicle that they are driving nothing but praise. They're often regarded as being highly refined, perfectly "evolved" through the ages, and an ultimate drivers' car. On top of this the 911 Turbo is the fastest/most powerful car I've driven. It has 500HP and 480 lb/ft TQ. It's also an AWD vehicle capable of launching 0-60 in 3 seconds flat. So with the highly vaunted Porsche heritage and the sheet specs to go with it, I was pretty psyched to drive this car.

My thoughts are as follows:

-In terms of overall aesthetics the car has typical Porsche understated looks. It has the bigger "turbo" wing in the back and some larger air scoops and things like that, but to me it was not particularly exciting or eye catching, just typical Porsche aesthetics. I will say that in real life it looks better than it looks in pictures, but I personally like the looks of a C5, C6, or C7 Corvette much more.

-To me the interior was much nicer than the Audi R8 that I had last weekend and for an 8 year old car it held up quite well. I still feel like German interiors are pretty over rated, it was "nice" but not "oh my god I'm basking in luxury and high quality workmanship everywhere I look. Like the R8 things felt "solid." which American cars don't quite feel like. In his video review of the car, Doug Demuro writes about how everything in the car is just so logical and driver centric. I'm the kind of person that likes simplicity so this appealed to me. In actuality, I found the interior to be a little odd. The left key-ignition thing is totally stupid, the window buttons are in a weird position, the cabin lights are kind of difficult to switch on, and in general you feel like everything is kind of placed somewhere odd or that the switches and buttons are not as intuitive as they could be. Not the end of the world in any regard, but odd. The blinker stock is super close to the steering wheel and very easy to flick with any finger, which I liked.

-I had a hard time finding a comfortable driving position. I also was not a huge fan of the seats (despite hearing how good/comfy they are) and I just couldn't seem to get my seat into a good relationship with the mirrors/steering wheel. I'm 6'0 170lbs so it's not like I'm particularly disproportional or typically have a hard time getting comfortable in a car. Again, not necessarily a flaw so to speak, but I didn't quite feel comfortable or settled in the car.

-To be completely honest the PDK transmission on this car was pretty disappointing. I'm sure modern PDK's are much better, but this car pretty much had the same shifting manners as my C7 Corvette A8. Downshifts happen just about instantaneously, upshifts seam to happen at an ideal "shift point" that the ECU already has mapped for a particular throttle input/speed. On the plus side the PDK has creep and is much more "normal" to drive so I enjoy it more than the R8's transmission in that regard. On the negative side the transmission isn't particularly exciting or engaging. I can see it being pretty awesome in 2010, but for a dual clutch leaves a lot to be desired and again, it is no faster or better than my torque converter A8.

-Handling felt decidedly neutral. It has that German "single bump then settle" characteristic but it seems to encounter bumps a lot more than the R8 did. Since there is more weight in the back there is a bit more confidence at speed and it feels easier to drive because of it. Though the 911 Turbo weighs about the same as the Audi R8 I feel like it's a lot easier to maneuver because the car feels like it is less wide. That being said I'm not overtly excited about the handling on this car. The R8 has the whole "carve into a corner thing" while my Grand Sport is a grip monster. This car just kind of handles well, but no particular characteristic really screams out to you. Maybe that's the beauty of a Porsche. My main take away is that the car is a lot bumpier than I expected (not to the point of being un-enjoyable) but the R8 and C7 Grandsport definitely have smoother rides with similar/more exciting handling capabilities. As a point of reference my GF felt a lot less safe in the Porsche 911 because of how it felt and handled, whereas the R8 and C7 just feel more composed. I also felt like this car, despite feeling more planted than my C7, just wasn't as capable of a handler. You could feel this car starting to give up grip or or become uncomposed whereas the C7 is always "..." in any street cornering situation.

-To me the power on this car is a pretty big let-down. It has more power than my C7's engine and it has AWD to help get all of that power to the ground so to me this thing should have been a total hoot to drive but that just wasn't necessarily the case. Here's how a WOT pull on this car goes:

3,000rpm- "yawn"

4,000rpm- "do I hear the Turbos spooling?"

4,500rpm- "yeah that has to be the turbos"

5,000rpm- "Oh cool here's boost"

7,000rpm- "This is kind of cool"

*shift*

3,000rpm- "yawn"

I have no doubt that this car is probably faster to 0-60 on paper, but in terms of driving experience it just doesn't really feel like it has tons of power until you get to 5,000rpm when the boost kicks in, but it jumps to redline pretty quickly after that, and then you're back to building power at the lower RPM's. The Corvette just seems to have power anytime and anywhere you want it, this car is very much like "oh you want power...okay it's going to show up in a few seconds" and it does deliver the power but it only lasts so long and you feel annoyed that you had to work to get there.

Another case in point so to speak. I was in 3rd gear in this car going about 60mph and I floored it and just about nothing happened. Do any meaningful throttle response in 3rd gear above 40 mph in the C7 and it's pretty much "pin you to your seat" until you hit redline and then once you're in 4th it still throws you into your seat for some fun through those first few thousand RPM's.
As I drove it more I did find out that the car liked to be in auto mode more than it liked to be in manual mode and I found that in auto it was a bit easier to get some mid-range torque and things of that nature. In general both my buddy and I felt that the power came on kind of weird. It was like a sling shot, hold down the throttle for a few seconds and then go flying, whereas the C7 is just ready to go constantly.

-This car is kind of soul-less. The exhaust is pretty muted, you hear it rumbling at idle but that's about it. At WOT all you hear is air/turbo whooshing, which some people like I guess, but it's incredibly dissatisfying when you're used to a V8. Heck my buddies' RS sounds appreciably more impressive than this car.

-Where I will give this car credit is that it does put its power to the ground well. Going WOT in a C7 is pretty much not even an option below 30mph because you'll just blow the wheels off. This car you can pretty much go WOT at anytime without any major consequences. For instance we were behind a 450+hp modded Mustang that was trying to show boat a bit. We had no problem keeping up with him, pretty much because we were AWD and could use our throttle whenever we wanted and he was RWD and could only use so much at a given speed. Now that being said, his car roared and sounded pretty badass, while all we were doing was whooshing around air and feeling oddly emasculated for some reason, but to the Porsche's credit it did have no problem keeping up.

-My car was a convertible and the convertible roof system on the car works very easily and intuitively. It was a lot of fun taking the top on and off in traffic and making the spoiler go up and down. I was literally just showing off every time I was at a light.

-The car is easier to push/drive at speed than the C7 is in the sense that it does get power to the ground better and is a bit more controllable. With the C7 you have docile, torquey, and then kill everything modes. This car has docile, quick, and fast modes. In other words I find myself being able to use the throttle more than I can with the C7.

-When in auto mode, sport plus pretty much just means the car will hold its gears till redline and then shift into the next one for you. This was kind of interesting as I would be revving up to 6500rpm in 1st (going like 30ish MPH) and the car would only shift once I hit redline. It would then do the same thing in 2nd. I felt like sport and sport plus made a difference in overall performance when in auto mode, but it was less noticeable in manual mode.

-The adaptive dampers were pretty much unusable in sport mode. The car is already quite bumpy to begin with so it wasn't like the adaptive dampening really improved the handling situation or tightened things up, it just made the car bumpier.

-Corvettes are known for being hard to park because of their long hoods, but I actually found this car to be a little harder to park because you don't really see over the top of the hood as well as you do in a Vette. In other words you have a harder sense of where your nose is. Again, not a make or break thing at all, just a surprise.

Personally I'm not much of a fan of the Porsche. It's not that the Porsche is a bad performer per say, but there's just nothing particularly impressive or exciting about it. Maybe that's what owning a Porsche is all about, that perfect balance, but to me this car is more so something that makes air-whooshing sounds in order to feel for 1.5 seconds what Corvette owners feel all throughout the RPM range. It doesn't look particularly exciting, doesn't sound exciting, handles a bit rougher than you might want and to me, it just isn't all that it's quite cracked up to be. I'd best describe this car as a silent killer of sorts. It can keep up with anything, and you'll have no problem controlling it while it does so, but it just isn't particularly fun, or exciting in doing so. There's definitely a certain beauty in that and I guess that's where all the Porsche hype comes from? To me it's honestly a bit overstated (at least in this particular vehicle) and if you're looking for fun and performance you can do a lot better with modern offerings for the same price and less of a headache in terms of repairs, upkeep, etc.

I know people don't tend to negatively review Porsches so I'm definitely not trying to be a Corvette fanboy or anything like that. I just think if you're in the used market for an $80,000ish car and want something fast and with some prestige behind it there's likely some better offerings for less headache. I personally enjoyed last weekend's R8 and my C7 much more than this car and in general wouldn't consider a Porsche in the future based on driving this car. Not a bad vehicle per say, in general it's just not for me, and especially for the price you can do MUCH better with today's offerings.

I fucked up. I'm in a pickle. Seeking advice. TLDR; American male (25), South African female (30), travels, whirlwind romance, baby, not working out. Going to miss out on my son growing up and feeling devastated about it.

Shit storm wall of text incoming.. Story time will be very blunt and straight forward. Sorry for poor grammar.

I hope it's worth the read, because I desperately need some solid advice.

At the start of 2017, I was a full on, loud, and proud MGTOW. Half-way through 2018, I find myself in a seriously unfathomable and heavy predicament.

So stepping back to 2016... I had just graduated from a military instituion, played four years of D1 ball, and ended up playing a brief stint in the minors. During that time, I was in a committed long distance relationship with my high school sweet heart.. Shocker, it didn't work out and we wasted our time. Afterwards, I found MGTOW and went on a fucking bender. Party, pump, dump, on repeat machine. Breaking hearts and really loving life with my bros.

Suddenly going into 2017, I got an offer to go play professionally abroad... Straya? Fuck u wot m8? I'm in! Adventure of a lifetime coming in hot and boy was it. So I get there, start playing some ball and was really digging the new vibe down under. The club hooked me up with a nice place to stay, a car, and pretty good pay. I was playing good ball and living life up. Strayans are super receptive of Americans and their women will fight eachother over us. Literally. I tore through them. That was cool. Life was good, but I wanted more.

After season, I decided I wanted to stay in the country a bit longer and explore. Solo road trip? LETS GO!!! I camperize this little honda civic and hit the road, no direction or care in sight. After camping the outback and throwing some boomerangs, I get to the next big city. It's a whole different dealio. Internationals everywhere and I quickly integrated into a group by the beach. Met a hot young British chick and started shacking up with her and her friends. Skating, surfing, and exploring the city most days. Thought about getting part time work, but didnt bother knowing I could make it through to next season.

One day, I was cruising by a cafe and saw her. Gents, this THOT was a 10/10 head turning stunner. The one that's got me in the position I'm in now. I walked right up to her table. Sat down. Introduced myself and she quickly captivated my attention. She sounded and behaved very differently. Odd English accent, interesting mannerisms and facial expressions. She was cold and hard at first, rude really. However my calm demeanour and persistent interest in her, won her South African heart over. I convinced her to take a walk with me to the beach and we have been walking together ever since. Even after I slept with the British chick that night and she knew it.

Second date and she gets her wallet and purse jacked, while we were sizing each other up in a hot tub on the beach. That’s a big deal to lose all your cards and money as an international traveller. No bueno. So I played it cool and told her that I would take care of her, until she was able to get her financials sorted and she promised reimbursement, yeah whatever. Anyway during that time, we got the very heavy hots for one another. I mean we would go at it and completely devour one another. This woman was a yoga model in her prime and I took full absolute advantage of her tight limber beautiful body. No regurts… Yet.

We decide to blow that popsicle stand and hit the road. The Great Ocean Road that is and it was an epic trip. Bouncing from sleepy ocean village all the way back to where I started. Before the end of our trip she asked me to continue the adventure with her to Bali, Indonesia and I couldn’t refuse. Honestly moving to Bali was the best thing I’ve ever done in my life. I have a love for that majestic tropical island and those friendly people deeper than I can put into words. Those were pretty much the best six months of my entire life. I was living a complete fantasy. Riding my motorbike through tropical jungles to secluded beaches and abandoned temples popping in to five star resorts to see my model girlfriend working with a plethora of international models. Yeah, life was good. Too good…

I sold a lot of things back home to keep the adventure alive. In fact, I pretty much at that point abandoned my life at home all together. One of my biggest current grievances is if I go home, I’m going back to nothing. However, I do have my loving family and they have not deserved what I have done.

Towards our six month mark, both of our birthdays were fast approaching and she wanted to go home to celebrate. Africa seemed like a cool next adventure so I bought our tickets. A week later and week before we left, the bomb was dropped. 1 month pregnant. I can say in all honesty that my son was made out of true love, but now I know what love really is. A chemical reaction in the brain when two people want to breed and that it will inevitably fade afterwards. Hard red pill to swallow right there, but Rick and Morty nailed it.

I’ll never forget the disappointed and shattered look on my parents face when we video called to tell them. It was as if they knew, and they did, that they would never get to be a part of their grandsons life. Her parents on the other hand were ecstatic. They knew we were coming home and now she was coming home to start a family.

I never thought for a moment that I should bail and get away. Even after some fights got really ugly. More and more her behaviour started to change. She was full of this rage i had never seen before. She would scream, yell, hit herself, and come at my physically. My time spent in a military environment proved to be useful in dealing with her bullshit. I could handle it all and be relatively unfazed, which often made her lose it even more. Some part of me still thought she was a NAWALT.

As her pregnancy progressed, so did her obsession with complete totalitarian control over me. I was able to integrate into South Africa and find work with notable success. I’m doing something I love and making a positive difference in many childrens lives. I even started a business back home to further support the organization I work for and our mission. However, she belittles and resents my work at every opportunity.  I’ve never cheated nor done anything of betrayal to her. The worst I’ve done is lied about smoking a joint now and then. She had a very serious smoking problem when we met that I was able to help her with. Now she thinks of me smoking on occasion with my friends or business partners as the ultimate betrayal of our relationship. I find it to be a healthier alternative to drinking, but whatever.

She births our baby boy after hours of labor, while I provided support for her the entire time. It’s quite something to go through. but holding your boy for the first time. A very inexplicable feeling indeed. Unwavering commitment and loyalty to safeguarding his health and security. This will be a big strong and smart man one day. He will do good things in the world I have no doubt and he has a good mother.

However, our incompatibility has started to weigh on us more and more heavily. She seemingly has borderline personality disorder I was unaware of. She has sought counselling in four previous relationships. AND I forgot to mention is five years older than me. Ouch. I know. Essentially, we seem to be about as compatable as Trump and Hillary. We are on the complete opposite sides of the political spectrum. She is a hardcore feminist, unable to take any red pill and I’m a steadfast conservative patriot.

So here we are now, sleeping in separate rooms, going to counselling, miserable as shit with a newborn baby who we both adore. The love, attractiveness, and relationship has dwindled into being non existent. Now I am at an awful cross roads. I want nothing more than to be apart of my boys life, but I am unable to stay in this country without getting married or paying out the ass and making numerous trips home to secure a visa. South Africa Home Affairs is actually a joke and huge money making scheme. They’ve fucked me over once already and I was forced out of the country two weeks after my baby boy was born. I know she is going to leave me inevitably for an older richer man to pay for her shit.

Has anyone been a situation like this?

I’m sick of typing now. Rant over. Feel free to ask questions. Thanks to anyone who read this and provides support.

Open letter to all the UCSD asian guys out there complaining about not being able to get a girl As an Asian male, I'm sick and tired of other Asian males bitching and moaning about being incompetitive in the dating pool.

On one hand, yes, us asian males tend to hang out on the bottom end of the desirability pool. Most of us are going to get shit all over on tinder. And yeah, the media systematically tries to emasculate us even while they oversexualize our female counterparts. It sucks, but whoop de fucking doo. Big fucking boo hoo. Our black brothers are getting shot out there for doing literally nothing wrong. Our latino brothers are getting kicked out of their country, the only country they know. Many many people have it MUCH worse than you. Us asian males are statistically likely to be more educated, get lighter sentencing, make more money, etc. We have it so good compared to other minorities, but your overentitled sorry bitchasses come to this bubble of a school and cry about not being served attractive women on a silver platter; yknow, the same way you had your education and relatively easy childhood served on a silver platter.

It sucks but yknow what, those of you who complain the most - the MOST single of you single mofos - most of yall dont do shit to improve your situation. Let me give you some short examples and some tips on how to fix them.

1) fucking be clean. I dont know why the fuck so many traditional asian families dont teach cleanliness, but you need to be fucking clean. Shower every day. Do your fucking laundry. Wear a fresh shirt every day or at least "rest" them before you wear them again. Trim your nails. Shave. You and I both know we grow patchy ass spider legs out of our face so fucking get rid of it all every single fucking day. And for the love of god, get your pube situation under control. No woman wants to fucking machete their way through 8 feet of pubes to find 2 inches of dick. Use nonscented deoderant and wear a scent. Seriously, nautica cologne is like 25 bucks on amazon and its decent. If your skin looks like the face of the moon, start taking care of that shit.

2) have a sense of style. Youre not fucking 12 anymore. Free t shirt from your dad's work event, cargo pants/shorts, white crew socks, and your tennis shoes from 10th grade arent going to cut it in the real world. Look around at what other guys - especially the ones that have attractive girlfriends - are wearing and do something similar. Here, ill give you a freebie...v neck solid color shirt, properly fit jeans, and your choice of not-fucking-tennis-shoes-oh-my-god-youre-not-15-anymore. Your free tshirts that youve worn to death that are now full of holes are NOT acceptable. Oh and do something about your hair. You dont need a kpop star hairdo...but your overgrown, unwashed, unstyled generic asian cut isn't exactly helping you get the punanifruit juices flowing.

3) "oh ya i cant follow step 1 and 2 because I don't have money and my parents wont pay for it" TF you wait WOT now?!? Bitch you are in COLLEGE. You are a fully legal adult. TF you MEAN your parents wont pay for it. Get your fucking shit together and find your bitch ass a fucking J O B, ya overpriviledged ass never-had-a-hard-day-of-work ass mom-and-dad-pay-for-everything ass mofucka. Lets say the stars align and your crush actually agrees to a date. Tf you gon do, take them to cafe V? Please, in the name of all that is good: THE BISTRO IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FIRST DATE SPOT. Please. Please stop. Please. Plus, working will help with the next one...

4) have a fucking PERSONALITY. This one is free.99 so theres literally no excuse to not have one. Learn some jokes, think of some interesting stories, etc. Become a cultured individual. Put down the fucking video games for like 15 minutes a day and read some philosophy, look at some art, learn some pop culture. Seriously, all you fuckers know is your major and video games. You take your date to not-the-bistro and then what? You gonna sit there in silence? Just nod your head every time she tries to engage you because you can recite all 150 original pokemon but you dont know anything about anything else? No you stupid fuck...smile, tell her about yourself, have some shit to talk about, and LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS. "Hurr durr well ill just find a pretty girl whos also into video games and anime like me". Do you KNOW how highly demanded those girls are? Even the eh looking ones are highly demanded. You and every other generic asian male is after the tiny, TINY population of anime/gamer chick, PLUS she needs to like you back. Being well cultured makes you much more competitive in that ultra-competitive niche, but it also lets you DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO. Yes, by being well cultured, well mannered, friendly, clean, and well dressed, YOU TOO can have a shot at the mystical ABG. Btw Idfk WHY yall have such raging boners for em...you know its literally all just makeup right? Take an ABG swimming...she dives in instagram model and comes out looking night-before-the-SAT

5) swallow your fucking huge ass ego. Jesus fuggin christ idk WHY so many of yall have such big egos but theyre not deserved and theyre a huge turn off. I cant tell you how many times ive wanted to punch an asian dude in the fucking face because their ego was so so so cringeworthy. Be humble. Be sincere. Be genuine. You aint slick and youre not god's gift to man. Youre often wrong, you have flaws, and nobody is obligated to like you. And for fuck's sake, you dont OWN women. Women dont owe you SHIT. Idc how nice you think you are: start assuming that you are a huge asshole and start measuring the impact of your actions and words. Start looking for feedback on how you do things and approach that criticism constructively instead of screaming that youre perfect the way you are. Bitch, the way you are is v SINGLE and that shit wont change if you dont.

6) you uncle chongs need to fucking stop. Youre not white and you never will be, so stop suppressing our black and latino brothers. Theres meaningful and honest dialogue to have about race relations among minorities, but fucking hold me BACK because I SWEAR ima FUQ UP the next clueless asian dickweed who says ""well they deserved to get shot by the cops because [insert typical dickweed reason]"". Yall are like crabs in a pot...instead of working with each other to escape yall pull each other back into the boiling water and then bitch and moan that things arent getting better for you.

7) get some exercise. Nobody is trying to get impaled on your bony ass. Get some mass and some tone in you. If youre overweight like me, start eating right and do some cardio. You dont need to be a model but you need to show you care at least somewhat.

At the end of the day, theres a good chance your crush is still going to reject you. And thats okay. This is a numbers game. Asian men as a category might be placed lower than everybody else, but you can be the top of your class...that alone is going to do wonders for you. And honestly, we're not too bad when we're done up properly.

If youre a single asian male crying about not finding a partner and you choose not to listen to any of this, your present situation is your own friggin fault and I feel nothing for you. Youre not even an involuntary celibate, youre a voluntary one. You chose this for yourself.

Ladies, if you have more to add please do. I would love to learn something new to try.

Yours in faith,
Anonymous Asian Dude

My dad secretly likes my GTI Recently got the mk7.5, fit with open air intake and borla for sound. My dad's always a practical as hell guy, abhors excess and thinks fun is wholly unnecessary, but I can tell he loves taking this car out every chance he gets, sometimes asking to borrow it entire days at a time. I often hear a lil WOT borla for a second here and there roaring in the distance

It's super cute and I feel like we share an extra bond, makes my car that much more special to me as well.

How slow am i suppose to let go of the clutch when I'm going WOT through the gears? I've recently got a Civic si 8th gen. I've been pretty much releasing the clutch fairly fast and accelerating right away. Feels good on the car but however the tires squeal when I do this only from 1st to 2nd? Am I suppose to release it way slower?

 I bought the car to wind it out without worry too much. The car wasn't too expensive, and parts are cheap. So I'm not too worried about excessive wear and tear.

What Can't I F*** Up? (Warning WOT Ahead) So I suppose this needs a bit of a preface.
I am a rather portly guy, socially awkward, and terrible about picking up social cues. I am also quite the lonely sad sack.  (On to the story.)

   How we met. Well... as per usual I was perusing Grindr, and astonishingly close to me is J. J is pretty new in town and looking to hang out with some new people. Me being the cliche stoner that I am, offer to smoke him out.

We meet, smoke, converse and learn a little bit about each other.  From there our friendship begins to blossom. Both being unemployed at the time much of our time was spent together. For about 4 weeks I spent as much time as I could at his place. 6 days a week for several hours of the day sounds about right.

I (Gay 20 M) told him a pretty substantial bit about myself, and opened up to him. He knows a lot about me, more than anyone. He (Bi 33 M) opened up too. I thought we had a good thing going, I was falling in love with having a friend. My singular friend.

He took me to Vegas for my first time. I had a stellar time, but the paradigm of our friendship was changed at the end on said trip. My supposition is that I must have done something.

It has been 3 weeks since Vegas. We have conversed via text but have yet too meet back up. This could be for a multitude of reasons.

1.) Telling him that he is my only friend.
He very well could be distancing himself from me.

2.) Being absurdly clingy.
He very well could be distancing himself from me.

3.) He is not smoking pot for the time being.
He is bettering himself and making a fiscally responsible decision.

The one that stands out to me the most is the tertiary reason. POT. The entirety of our friendship was build on smoking, our biggest commonality. Without being to smoke together our major tie was severed.

Quite honestly I don't know how to spend time with him without smoking. The age gap in addition to differing life experiences leave me at a loss. We can certainly talk about hot cars, or hot guys or something or another but the topics run thin. I suppose that is my fault for being boring.

I suppose this is a bit of a vent as opposed to a typical AGB question.

Suggestions, comments, critiques, ridicule, bring it on. I'm a glutton for punishment.

[M4F] Then (150 years ago) And Now Then:
One hundred and fifty years ago, on Saturday nights, the loggers would pack little suitcases with their better clothes, catch the down-river boat, and come to town for weekend excitement.  They’d get a bath, shave, and a haircut:  change their clothes, get a shoeshine and head for the dance halls. “Oh ya sure,” the unofficial centenarian historian said.  “We had 5 different girlie houses around town.  Der was the same number of saloons, churches, and girlie houses—five.”

Now:
Drum sounds came from the dusty speakers in the dark ceiling.  The drums were out of tune and distracting, his eyes and mind closed for a moment and he missed the stripper hitting the single harsh spotlight on the round stage.  She wore a low-cut hunter green, satin gown with spaghetti straps, a hem that brushed the floor and a long slit in the front of the skirt that reached her pussy.  A single saxophone joined the drums, ‘Waaa wot wot wa naaaaaaa …’  The stripper, had broad shoulders and an all around ample body, BMI about 25.  She held her shoulder length red hair behind her head with two hands, leaned toward the audience, and swayed her ample tits ensconced in a sequined cream colored bra under her hunter green gown.

Other men with dilated pupils were sitting at tables surrounding the stage and had bills in hand and at the ready. He felt nothing.  The stripper kicked not very high and not in beat with the sax, and the ABCs of maleness, actuary, builder, cabbie, whistled and applauded.   He, the—never fuck your graduate student—drive across town to the dive strip joint—professor, sat numb.

Now the stripper, who had yet to remove her gown, leaned directly towards his rimless glasses.  Clutching his brown bottle of Miller Lite with both hands, his gaze bounced between her face and her cleavage.  He wondered if those spaghetti straps were made with carbon fiber reinforcement.  He wondered about the stripper’s story. He thought she looked kind, about his age but it was difficult to tell in the harsh light and heavy make-up. There was no lust, no fantasy of her riding his cock while her breasts bounce in front of him, and when her performance ended, he left a tip, slipped into the darkness of the audience and found the front entrance.

Years ago, after he and his wife of 30 years divorced, he bought an old two story stone boathouse.  He kept his rowing sculls below.  Upstairs, the rooms are defined more by furnishings than by walls. With windows all around, the views of the water were a good match for his needs. The back part of the boathouse was a workshop normally for boat repairs, but where, at the moment, a wooden racing single scull was bent around its forms, spiral cedar shavings on the floor.  He could have been Doc from Cannery Row.  Now at home, he opened a beer, lit two candles on the fireplace and a short stubby old blue candle on the bench that served as a coffee table.

He gazed at lights from the marina across the water and let his mind wander—to women.  The graduate student in his Tuesday lecture, older, glasses dark wavy hair wearing a long black maxi skirt with a slit up the side, never stops making eye-contact: the realtor who found this boathouse for him:  the visiting professor of Contemporary American Literature:  the limnologist.  He wondered if any of these interesting women were thinking about him.

He heard the unlocked door open, the unmistakable clink of beer bottles and the rich voice calling, “Anyone home?”

Jetted too high? I’ve got a Tomos with a 70cc alukit 15.15 aha carb and a bi-turbo exhaust. I’m currently running a 68 main but when I run it at wot on the road it almost wants to die, I let off and it will go again. Am I four-stroking? I had it at 66 originally but felt that was way too low for this setup, but maybe not. I’ve got the same carb on a 50cc with a boss pipe and that’s got a 63 main

I bought an old hacked Wii, but some things don't work as they're supposed to... Ok, so yesterday I bought a nice red Wii. I was very excited to come home, mod it, and play some games. However, I found out it was already modded, the problem being it was modded like 5 years ago or something. I tried playing some games from my usb drive, and at first, everything seemed to be ok. Mariokart Wii was working, New smb Wii too, but then I tried Wii Sports. I got a black screen. I tried Resort. Black Screen. Wii Party-black screen, and so on. So, where's the problem? Is it that it's running an old version of cfw? Is it that I¨m using a big flash drive? Is it that I was trying to play ntsc games on a pal console?

pls help idk wot to do and I really wanna play xd

[Skin Concerns] Moisturizer suggestions for sensitive skin that doesn't know what it's reacting badly to? (EVERYTHING BURNS) Hello lovely people! I need help looking for a moisturizer that doesn't give me closed comedones or make my face red, hot, itchy and sting-y!
As this all suggests, I have sensitive skin that has not liked any moisturizer I have ever tried. This includes The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (it gives me a burning sensation and dry, red patches after a few uses). I've also tried other moisturizers that you can get here in Australia (literally all of the Sukin brand moisturizers and the Swisse Echinacea Clear Skin Moisturizer) and they have given the same painful reaction, leaving them to collect dust in my bedroom.

With that being said, I haven't reacted from using chemical exfoliants as much as I have from moisturizers, which is just absurd! Because of this, I have basically skipped moisturizing and have only been using the Cicaplast Baume B5 by La Roche-Posay day and night. This HG product totally helped heal my skin from what TO's moisturizer did to it.

Anyway, not sure what I'm even reacting to (my guess is fatty alcohol but gosh this leaves me with like a total of three moisturizers to choose from and they're all hella expensive). Which makes your guess as good as mine!

My skin : Normal (neither overly oily or dry), sensitive

Current winter skincare routine :
AM) Cold water, Pyungkang Yul Essence Toner, The Ordinary Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F, Hada Labo Goku-Jyun Hyaluronic Milky Lotion, LRP Cicaplast Baume B5, Skin&amp;Lab fre C Sun Lotion
PM) The Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Rich Oil, Sukin Derma Oil Balancing Wash, Pyungkang Yul Essence Toner, TO's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, Skin&amp;Lab Red Serum, Skin&amp;Lab Glacial Water Soothing Gel, LRP Cicaplast Baume B5

Exfoliating products (used thrice a week max) - COSrx AHA7, TO's Lactic Acid 5% + HA, COSrx One Step Original Clear Pad, Secret Key Lemon Sparkling Peeling Gel

(thought sharing my routine could give an idea of my concerns + what doesn't give me an allergic reaction)

I'm actually very happy with my skincare routine at the moment. My skin looks the best it ever has (gotten rid of textured, splotchy skin and whiteheads). But I do think I need a moisturizer because as much as I love the Cicaplast Baume I need a little more hydration for winter, especially during the day + it leaves a whitecast and some grease. So any suggestions you have would be great! I want to try any and all the brands! Anyway!! Thanks for reading this far, am so excited to post for the first time in this thread! I've never gotten to talk about my skincare addiction before! &lt;3

tldr: all moisturizers burn, only been using Cicaplast Baume B5, wot do I do??

DMs of Reddit: Tell me your party's best roleplaying moment. My personal favorite was when our Orc barbarian, who fancies himself a medic since he carries all the healing kits, walks into a battlefield surgeon's tent and exclaims.

"OK I seez yer problem. Wot you've done, an dis a rookie mistake so'z don't feel bad, but wot yer done, is cut der patient open so now her insides are on der outside."

"An der insides ain't meant ter be on d'outsides, dey'z meant ter be on da inside. Dat's why dey's call yer insides da insides. Cus dey meant ter be on da inside"

Our party couldn't stop laughing for a good 7 minutes.

Barclay's employs the maddest lads After finishing my pre bank appointment shopping and attending said appointment, I was sat sweltering in the waiting area, using my crappy wide brim hat as a fan.

After I get called in for my interview, I get to sit in a room with amazing full power air conditioning, it was pure heaven ...

Yet I get asked by if the air con is on too high and if I want it turning off.

Struggling Vet, life just disintegrated in the last 3 days, and IDK what to do anymore. My entire life just fell apart in the last three days and im completely lost and have no motivation to do anything but sit here and stare at my walls. Im a full time student currently on my GI Bill, 11 year Army and National Guard Vet. Recently my GF and I just broke up a couple days ago but that is only the beginning of my tailspin. Rushing home the other day to try and meet up with a classmate in order to take my Final, i got pulled over right at my off ramp for home trying to get around an uphill semi to get to my exit. Not the end of the world right. Well apparently my ex wife hasnt been paying the insurance like she was supposed to according to the divorce, and to top it all off apparently i completely spaced a ticket about a year ago as well so theres even more. No insurance ticket and driving with a suspended liscense ticket as well for a total of 4 tickets all together as well. Im also/ or was a budding photographer. A friends mom own a ranch and wanted photography services for the ranch and horses. well we discussed this during the winter and i figured spring and summer were the ideal times for such shoots and between now and then i have had absolutely no word from them on desired extra shoots or any word at all period. I knw a little of it is my fault for not contacting them myself as well, and i dont want to try and use it as an excuse but with schooling it was very hard for me to track multiple things at once. Well when i contacted them a few weeks ago underlining my availability, they requested their $300 back within 2 weeks. As a full time student on my GI Bill i make enough to survive normally, but i still live paycheck to paycheck, and with the way the GI Bill pays out. pro rated for non 30 full day school month, and this being summer quarter and there being a month break thats a whole month income less that normally before now i would save for and make it through just fine but these tickets and them wanting the 300 back too, as well as any extra fees to reinstate my liscense so i can actually drive again to im not going to make it through this summer. And idk what to do. people always say oh veterans services here or offer this that or another. But most american people really dont realize that the country really doesnt care about its vets. sure i could get help if i was a drug addicted veteran on the street, but im not. those of us who normally survive just fine and then just have life serve us a really shitty hand theres no help at all. Ive researched and reached out to so many programs it isnt funny. I have no where to turn. Ive lost my girlfriend and the one person in all of this that i want a hug from and to be able to talk to and be able to cry around. Im completely lost and frankly i dont even want to leave my house and go to my classes which means im looking at possibly losing my GI Bill if that happens to. Even my VA PTSD claim i wot see for god knows how long because i was paid seperation pay when i left the army 4 years ago and i dont get to see disability money till that is paid back, so all disability checks go right to that and not me right now. I have no motivation to do anything but sit here and stare at my walls. Please help, any way possible because i dont know what to do anymore.

BOV maintenance question So I'm running Turbosmart dual port BOV for Fiesta ST (Part # TS02031066), and it has been on my car for almost 26,000 miles. It works great: lovely noises I absolutely adore ("flutter" you hear under vacuum when you shift is not compressor surge, please do your research), I hold 21 psi of boost under WOT (sometimes for a split second I make 22 psi lol), steady idle, no weird behavior - in general, it works as advertised and still performs as good as when it was freshly installed. Now, Turbosmart recommends 10,000 miles/6 months cleaning interval, but to be honest I burn through 10,000 miles fast, and being stock tune I don't really hit high boost + I don't boost the car that often (1 WOT pull every like 1-2 days through 2-3-4 gears, that's it). Online I found conflicting results: some people religiously clean it per the book, some only clean it when they see the signs of BOV getting dirty (not building boost, piston getting stock, idle is getting weird, etc.). I'm of the view that if shit works and performs as need, then don't touch it and let it work - when it stops working as needed, then address the issues. Has anyone cleaned their BOV or is anyone following that 10,000 mile cleaning interval? I'm probably gonna eventually take it out in about 4000-5000 miles, but I feel like cleaning every 10,000 miles is a bit way too much.

ALL THE KIDS ARE DOING THIS HOT NEW TRICK [99% not clickbait, 1% dicks] So I discovered this new super-sick hipster-kickflip mannaman trick for getting drugs into your drugs-port: \*\*\*SNOTRAILING\*\*\*

What you gotta do is, hock up a load of phlegm (the more viscose the better re: solubility) then greb it into a coffee cup or whatever. Mix it with alcohol (vodka, gin whatever) I like to go 50-50 - then nuke it til it's HOT AS WOT-WOT and dump your drugs in the cup and stir the fucker like you're late for church and you can't find your fave Sunday-Best cologne. Stir til its dissolved. Slam it in the nukerowave one mo' time for like 20-30secs so it's bubbling like a kettle in the bath, then grab a pippette/syringe and squirt that splurt right up your nose-snirlts. MORE PAIN = BETTERER DRUGS EFFECTS.

This will be the new dabbing in 6 months I guarantee it millennials are gonna be merking that sticky shit!

[FOOT STOMP] fight me [I would like to rage](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/ff/ea/bbffea9fc994df67d805ddc57697171c.gif)

I .. am just looking for a fight. And I feel bad, because my bf is getting the brunt of it.. because he's the one that's there.

I'm just so mad.

I started out today in such a great mood. I was going to go car shopping! For the first time ever! ... and then my mom decided she didn't want to go.

And then I found out the pc shop is charging me $40 just for diagnosing my pc, after I had been told (by an intern) that it would be free.

And then I had a conversation with my dad about my mom, and found out some things that I don't want to go into, but.. they are things that really made me mad.

And then I got a letter, not *from* SSA.. from another government area.. but it says, in the letter, that my SSI Federal and State payments have stopped, and I am losing my food stamps, and my medical insurance.

And .. I cried, for a long time. I *just got approved* in May. I have received exactly 1 check from SSA. Now this? I fought this shit.. to get approved.. for almost 10 years. Now they just want to take it away? Again, the letter was not from SSA itself, so I have.. no answers. Maybe it's a mistake. I don't know. I called my attorney but by the time I got the letter it was almost 7 pm, so.. I just left a message.

I seriously considered swallowing an entire bottle of pills, tonight, because.. I just can't do this anymore. I can't continue this fight.

And then.. I went into my parents room, and my mom asked me what "LGBT" stands for, and I tell her, and she says "Oh okay, that's cool, it's in this article about LGBT Marvel characters.. there are a few, but more are coming?" and I say "Oh, cool. Deadpool is pansexual."

And there is a brief discussion over what "pansexual" means, and my mom is just nodding and listening, and trying to understand, and my dad is just *scowling* at me.

"How do you know? You don't read the comics." He's right. I have only ever read one Deadpool comic in my entire life. But I tell him, I don't need to read the comics - the information is online. It's been a huge topic for a while now. I have read many bits of comics, showing Deadpool admitting attraction to Thor and flirting with Spider-Man, and the fact that DP's creator himself has said DP's sexuality is fluid (in more words).

"But he's only ever *been* with women." You know, I suppose that's true - but that doesn't make him any less queer. I didn't say that part, to my dad, I just shrugged.

My dad continued to scowl. So I came back to my room, and I mentioned to a friend about how my dad reacted when I said that Deadpool was an LGBT character, because.. I was mad, and hurt.

And this friend responds with:

"Wot

How

Not that I really care, cause deadpool is shit

But how is it lgbt?"

And I don't know, maybe this friend really had no idea, maybe they were just curious, but it hit a switch in my brain, and it really pissed me off. I mean I was already mad, but now .. super pissed.

I hate being mad, but right now - while mad - I hate who I am when I'm not mad. I'm too fucking nice. I don't know how to say "no". I don't know how to stand up for myself.

But when I'm mad like this, too... I blow up at everything. Which I also don't like.

I guess I just don't like *me*, period. But I hate the world even more.

Motor mount(s) need replacement? Vibration in pegs, bars, and seat Hi Everyone. Bike is a 2006 Ninja 500r - stock. 15,000 miles. I got the bike around this time last year, and have put about 1000 miles on it so far.

Last week, I was riding home from work, and relatively suddenly, I noticed an increase in vibration in the footpegs, bars, and seat, at ALL RPMS, from idle to higher RPMs at WOT. The bike vibrates/shakes pretty significantly at idle while stopped.

The bike seems to be running completely fine, no issues idling or accelerating, no bogging under heavy throttle etc.

I had a carb synch and valve adjustment done a few months ago, and have ridden around 500 trouble-free miles since then.

When I got home and looked down at the motor mounts, I noticed some pretty significant cracking in the left front mount, but the right front mount looks better. (photos linked below, first several are left mount, last one is right mount)

https://imgur.com/a/9BQfbtY

I have read on forums that on 500Rs the left mount is the one that tends to go, due to more stress being placed on the left mount.

Unfortunately I am new to motorcycling, and live in an apartment without access to a garage or a lift/jack. I am not *especially* mechanically inclined (though I am learning). I have read on the forums that on Ninja 500Rs the engine needs to be dropped to replace motor mounts, and I don't feel comfortable doing that myself at this point.

So I want to try to confirm that this is in fact the problem before paying a shop to replace the mounts.

Anything else to look out for or advice for confirming that this is in fact what my issue is?

THANK YOU

Briefly-stiff steering wheel and read steering wheel warning light during hard corndering  ...so at my last track day, I was lucky enough to have a session with  noooo traffic at all.  I pushed like mad and had a blast, throwing the  car into bends and powering out with all care (and smoothness) gone out  the window.  The car was OK with  it....mostly.


On one occasion and one occasion only, during understeer coming out of a  second-gear sweeper under WOT (with all nannies turned fully on), I had  a very brief moment of the steering wheel locking or at least getting  really really heavy.  At the same time, the red steering wheel light  came on.  I backed off the throttle a little and the condition cleared  and has not come back.


Should I be concerned about tracking the car again -- or should I just  not mat it while still turning out of a corner?  Was this maybe the  TC/ESC kicking in?

Setsuna, with the help of Azura, against the entire cast of FEH. (A Setsuna/Azura showcase) [So this is part 2 showcase](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/8tvbzp/my_main_team_drawn_by_willanator93/) of one of my oldest team and the focus this time is on Setsuna and her partner Azura. (**WARNING:** *This guy is obsessed with Setsuna, so it's going to be a loooong post. I will try to add a TL;DR at the bottom..if I remember ._.*)

Since Setsuna is my favorite character in this game, I wanted to do something special with her once I reached +10 on her. This is a showcase of the potential a unit can have given enough support and investment.

---
**[Azura+1 (+Atk -Hp)](https://i.imgur.com/FjJIyXE.png)**
-
&gt; Got lucky with her IV and I will probably only change it if I get a +Spd.

I was very happy when [her and Ryoma](https://i.imgur.com/EOeQIDv.png) appeared almost back to back on the first Hero Fest. Didn't know anything about her at the time besides the fact that she was the face of fates. She became Setsuna's partner and since then I don't think I have ever field one unit without the other.

Her job is dancing Setsuna around the map, buffing her at the start of the turn and tanking red armor units (or A!Tiki) with the goal of either killing them or bringing them down for Setsuna to KO.

* **Weapon: Slaying Lance (Spd)**
&gt;Now, even though Azura only tanks red units, I still prefer having slaying lance on her instead of her default weapon. The simple reason is that....gem weapons are just boring and on the hands of the AI it's just a free kill.

* **Assist: Sing**
&gt;Yup.

* **Special: Moonbow**
&gt;Thanks to Slaying Lance, she gets instant moonbow on the EP.  If I can get more SB fodder, I would gladly give it to her and change her special for that instant Luna in EP.

* **A skill: Fury**
&gt;In place until I can get another B!Ike. I just hate Fury with passion at this point. Maybe even TA for the time being even though I also hate it.

* **B skill: Wings of Mercy 3**
&gt;I don't think I need to explain it, but I don't use it that much anymore and I'm trying not to rely on it. I have a special skill reserved for her in the future that I will show later.

* **C skill: Hone Attack**
&gt; Key skill

* **Seal: Drive Attack 2**
&gt; Another key skill. Before the Drive Attack seal, she had Fortify Res 3 to give 2 buffs to Nino, but since I'm splitting the team, I decided for this change.

So in short words: "dance and tank red threats", but the most important aspect of Azura is that she gives +2 all stats to Setsuna as her partner, +4 atk with Hone and +3 drive atk. All of this sums to 57-58 atk on Setsuna. I obviously have to close to Azura for this to work, but it's never been a problem. These two formations are the ones I use to gain those stats:

* [57 attack on Setsuna](https://i.imgur.com/VHsY9cD.png)

* [58 attack on Setsuna](https://i.imgur.com/JaqHeTx.png)

I'm using Azura because I like her and she is a singer, but as you can see, this is something that any unit can do and it's not something exclusive to her.

---
**[Setsuna+10 (+Spd -Res)](https://i.imgur.com/SnaDPpX.png)**
-
&gt;As everyone knows, Setsuna has a 28 base atk. That is the 18th lowest (out of 94) for range units and 2nd lowest (out of 21) for archers and my choice for IV went to +Spd. Yea, it's super low, but after this you will realize how little I care and why I'm not in a hurry to change it to +Atk.

She is the star of this game for me. Having never played a FE game before Heroes I didn't know her at all. After looking at her art/sprite/VA she instantly became my favorite unit. She began as a reliable Takumi counter thanks to her Bowbreaker in the pre-SI era and when SI came she started to shine even more with each passing update.

* **Weapon: Brave Bow+**
&gt; You would think Low mt + low base atk would the ingredients for a bad weapon choice, but thanks to the rest of her skills, she reaches a nice attack stat and with a 40 base spd she reaches 46 atk on her own and 47-48 spd if Azura is near her.

* **Assist: Reposition**
&gt;I still have a lot of merges to go on Azura before considering giving up Repo for a dual rally skill so..yea.

* **Special: Luna**
&gt;The best special for this build. On the very first battle, Luna will always proc on the 4th hit (if it even gets to that point) or on the 3rd hit. (after tanking 1 hit from the enemy)

* **A skill: Life and Death**
&gt; Just a solid stat boost to Atk that also negates the penalty of the Brave Bow+. With this skill, her physical bulk is 69 while her magical bulk is 67. Letting her get hit by a melee unit is a valid move that I use to charge Luna and kill those WF units in two hits.

* **B skill: Desperation**
&gt; This is just a great skill. Useless when the enemy can't retaliate, but when it does, she will tank the hit like a champ and from that point onward she will quad anything before there's any type of retaliation. Not a fan of using assist skills like Ardent Sacrifice or Reciprocal Aid because as long as she can tank a hit, she will enter Desperation range.

* **C skill: Savage Blow**
&gt; For the longest time, I had no idea what to do with her C slot. I tried Threathen Defense 3, but found it unreliable to proc when I needed it the most (Except with armor untis). Then I started using Savage blow on GHB and realized how good of a skill it was. Simply put, if there's no vantage involved I can hit for 7-21+ dmg to a tanky unit so that I can get the kill in 2 hits. Even when vantage is present, I just need to be careful. Overall, savage blow is a great C skill for her. As for other options, I tried pulling S!Al**ph**onse for his Def Smoke, but decided it wasn't a good skill on her.

* **Seal: Attack+3**
&gt;This is just more attack for Setsuna. The only way I would change it is if IS releases a Desperation or Guard Seal.

The idea **on paper** is simple. I buff Setsuna with Hone, Drive and Ally support for that sweet 57-58 atk and she deletes everything in her path. Then I use Azura to dance for an extra kill or reposition her to safety. **In practice**, it's a little bit more complicated than that. (makes it more fun!) I have been Setsuna through out all the metas, (so OHKO, Horse and now Dragon/Armor emblem, AKA EP meta) and the last one is the most interesting and fun to deal with as a player phase unit.

---
Now that I explained the builds, it's time to show how this goes on practice. At this point I guess everyone is sick of cookie cutter builds, so this is why I wanted to do a little bit more than just a textbook showcase. If you are a new player and you wonder why people say brave weapons/dire thunder trivializes the game, I will show you why. So I decided to put Setsuna and Azura against the entire summonable cast of FEH. **This was done with Setsuna doing 100% of the damage and Azura only acting as support.** There were no other units or any other skill involved besides the ones shown.

There was only one rule:

* "**Only Setsuna is allow to do damage and she can only attack the enemy once.**"

So I can't attack and then dance for a second round. That would make things too easy. Savage blow is fair game and entering combat (but not attacking) is fair game as well.

So yea, sounds simple right? Well...eventually, I started coming up with complicated rules to make things as fair as possible, but then decided not to enforced them. Rules such as:

* "NO defensive tiles"

I wanted the 1v1 to be fair, but you will never know the pain that is searching hours upon hours for specific units and when you finally find the unit, you are not able to screenshot a clean kill because the enemy refuses to leave the defensive tile. [These maps were the biggest offenders](https://i.imgur.com/9Y5bbwR.png) (with the zipper and island map being the worse for anything that wasn't a horse). Eventually I came to realize the rule was stupid because even if the enemy or Setsuna was in a defensive tile, the outcome of the battle would have been the same. So I decided to **avoid defensive tiles as much as possible and in the un-avoidable cases, I made sure that the end result wouldn't be affected in either way.** I added a small icon next to the units name just to show when a defensive tile took place.

* "Only use Savage Blow on units that require SB dmg for the kill"

Savage Blow is a key skill that is used against the bulkiest units in the game. I tried my hardest to not abuse it on units that didn't required it for the kill, but I ran into situations that just made me want to rage quit. I was having a hard time getting clean kills because of other units getting in the way. It was the pain of searching for days for a +10 merged un-common unit and not being able to get a clean kill because of a stupid Reinhardt getting in the way. So I said to myself:  regardless if the unit was missing 7-14 HP, it would have been a kill in either the first 2 shots or the 3rd (after tanking 1 hit if the unit had DC). So yea, regardless if the units was missing HP, it was still dmg done only by Setsuna and if you do the math, every missing HP is divisible by 7 to show that. (All except for [that fully buffed Iote +10 Subaki](https://i.imgur.com/a/vigzEkR.png) in which he attacked Fjorm and lost 3 HP. I just wanted to put him because that was one of the hardest flying units I dealt with in this experiment.)

So yea...there's **259+** units so that's a lot of units to find and kill. I divided them in different categories. (Initially I wanted to just make a big picture, but I can't make a picture that big on MS Paint ._.) (All the units shown are pre-summer banner. So no Summer Cordelia, Tana, Innes and Noire. The last unit I added was Canas.)

---
 **[Armor units](https://i.imgur.com/cz0hzfZ.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt;So yea, armor units are meta, but if there's **NO** vantage on the enemy team, Setsuna can just go to town. As long as I keep the units off the defensive tiles, I don't care about the order in which I kill units and [I can take a hit because it allows me to enter desperation range for the next fight.](https://i.imgur.com/bkroRDE.png) (So bold/vengeful fighter/QR are irrelevant.)

&gt;If there's a unit with **Wary Fighter and DC**, most of the time I won't be able to kill the unit in two hits, so I have to play around Luna for that. I will target another unit and make sure I ORKO in 2-3 hits. With this I will have Luna at 1 (or charged) which guarantees the KO in two hits.

&gt;If I face a combination of **both vantage and WF+DC units**, I will carefully plan out which units to take out. This is by far the hardest fights, but thankfully very few teams run several units with vantage. Simply because everyone prefers the higher SP fighter skills. Vantage is only common on units like Hector and BK for some reason.

Notable units:

&gt; * I do get Omnibreak Hector from time to time, but they can be dealt with some SB spread to break the riposte [or just having Luna at 1 or charged.](https://i.imgur.com/L0IhkrF.png) (If I have it at 2 and no other unit to attack, I can let Hector hit me to charge it.)

&gt; * Since Armor units are meta, I really didn't had much trouble finding each of them. I think the hardest to find were Zephiel and Arden. I only found like 2 of each in all my tries. There's only 1 Arden there because the other one destroyed me.. (As I will show in the FAIL section.)

---
 **[Dragon units](https://i.imgur.com/3dMK2Zk.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt;Dragon units are also meta with the majority of them running the SB/WB/DC, QR, Aether build. As long as I take them off defensive tiles, they will die to a quad. If Luna is at 1 or charged, they die on 2 hits. Otherwise Setsuna will tank the hit and enter desperation range and kill the rest of them. The only thing that could maybe prevent Setsuna from tanking a hit is if the dragon activates a 4+ special after two hits with the help of infantry pulse + QP seal. That's in theory because I never encountered that situation since Aether just scores better at the Arena.

&gt;Another good thing about Setsuna is that she doesn't have unbalanced defenses. Her Res and Def are pretty much the same, so in the end it doesn't matter which stat they target.

Notable units:
&gt; * Myrrh, in my eyes, is the scariest dragon in the game to face as a PP archer. Her end-game build basically behaves as a Wary Fighter + Distant Counter + Quick Riposte armor unit with 2 space movement that flies and ignores terrain. (*Who thought that was a good idea?!*) I need to either damage her for 14 dmg or blow her up with a 2 hit Luna proc. It's not hard to pull this on armor units because they are too slow to reach you (Armor march is not an issue since you can separate units and blow the armor march user first.) and that gives you enough time to plan ahead, but Myrrh doesn't give a shit. She comes right to your face ignoring terrain and since Azura is always near Setsuna, you can guess who Myrrh targets right away. Thankfully, the AI sucks at using assist skills so she is always the target of a repo/draw back which makes life a little bit easier.

&gt; * M!Grima was scary when he came out, but in the end he's just a slow armor. He, alongside Nowi, are the most common dragon units.

&gt; * F!Grima is also interesting, but Dragonskin is not really enough to save her from a quad.

---
 **[Flying units w/o Iote's Shield](https://i.imgur.com/XlR6wNZ.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt;So yea, we all know what happens to Flying units without Iote Shield. :(

Notable units:
&gt;* Took me some time to find a S!Camilla that wasn't running the TA, Raven, Iote shield build....

&gt; * I'm also grateful that archers don't have to worry about flying mages, because they [sure hit super hard.](https://i.imgur.com/CY7ncWd.png)

---
 **[Flying units with Iote's Shield](https://i.imgur.com/fvLXi6N.png)**
---
Notes:
&gt; So yea, even with Iote Shield most fliers still can't survive a quad. Iote does help for non-brave weapons, but since they get doubled, it's still a lot of damage to take in. Iote shield works better on the bulkiest fliers. With those, I do have to plan a little bit with Savage Blow.

Notable units:
&gt; * [This Beruka was hands down insane to take down in one round](https://i.imgur.com/b9cOX7R.png). Luna did 34 dmg so a quad was 46 dmg total. With 55 total HP, I needed 2 savage blow to bring her into ORKO. That one was difficult since she also had an ally with fortify fliers which brought her defense to 60. A quad with that defense is only 28 damage.

&gt; * [This Subaki was the only +10 I was able to find](https://i.imgur.com/rcLKMN1.png) and he was also a pain to kill in 1 round. The differences between him and Beruka is that he can reach a Spd threshold which makes it hard to quad. I made a mistake and he lost 3 HP in a battle against Fjorm, but it was still overkill when Setsuna attacked.

&gt; * As for rare units, I would say Narcian was the rarest flying unit with NY!Camilla coming in second.

---
 **[Cavalry melee units](https://i.imgur.com/Brq8026.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; Initially I thought horses were popular, but unless the bonus unit of the week has melee horses, I don't find them that much in the Arena. It seems few people have them on their Arena core. Very few of them required SB to take down in one round and not a lot of them run DC to fight back.

Notable units:

&gt; * The most annoying horse to take down in one round is non-DC Sigurd because of his ability to reduce consecutive attacks by 80%. Depending on his defense I have to see if he needs SB, Luna or if I can just bypass it by saying: "*fuck it, he will die with the quad*". He's not scary, just very annoying to deal with.

&gt; * When I started this project, Ares recently came out so I wasn't able to find a fully built Ares, but I would say that a DC Ares on vantage range and with Special ready to use is scary.

&gt; * If you can't separate Eldigan and Exalted Chrom from the rest of the team, they will be incredibly hard to deal with. These two gave me the most trouble in the Arena because of their high defense and hp.

&gt;* This category holds the holy trinity of the rarest units in the game for me. These units are Clive, Spring Xander and Luke. I have something special reserved for Clive and Spring Xander because I want to thank the users that use them on their team, but if you saw my kill on Luke you will notice it's the Luke from the Double Chain challenge on Lunatic.

&gt;* Let me level with you...**nobody, I repeat, nobody** runs Luke on the Arena. I have been spamming AA for hours for almost a month and I was able to find every single unit at different merges, but I was never able to find a Luke. There was [this guy that had a Luke, but it was on beginner and it wasn't even level 40.](https://i.imgur.com/lNHc7tJ.png) I encountered him twice and it doesn't seem the guy still plays because it was still lvl 34. If you want more proof, just check [The 5* Lv.40+10 Build Compendium](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/wiki/meta/5-star-lv-40-plus-10-build-compendium). The +10 Luke is just a vanilla one without any additional skills. It just screams "*someone do a +10 for the compendium's sake!!!! Please!!*" So yea, I was never able to find a Luke at my score range. (It doesn't help that at higher scores, horses just disappear so yea..) If I ever find him, I will just edit the image, but I have been postponing this for weeks and frankly, at this point, I don't care.

&gt;* Cain and Abel..also pretty rare to find, but I was able to find the two in one fight. (More at the bottom of the thread.)

---
 **[Cavalry ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/923Vehv.jpg)**
---
Notes:

&gt;One of the most popular categories because of Reinhardt and B!Lyn. With melee units, I don't have a problem on letting Setsuna tank a hit to charge my Luna, but with ranged units we now get Blizzard, Blade tomes, Dazzling staffs, etc. Some of those weapon will OHKO her if I let her take the hit. So this category is just PP all the way on them.

Notable units:
&gt; * Cecilia hands down. [I can take down a raven tome Cecilia](https://i.imgur.com/Li2LYPM.png), a Raven with bowbreaker...maybe with SB and a Luna, but a Raven+TA+Bowbreaker/QR...yea, not a chance. With blade tome, she is still scary [if you engage her with buffs.](https://i.imgur.com/Mpernjy.png) Since she is a 3 star unit, if you get her in the Arena, it's a guaranteed +10 with 50/50 on blade or raven tome.

&gt; * The rarest units in this category are Nana and WoT!Olwen. (I lost a screenshot of a +10 Green Olwen and spend 2 days searching for another one...In the end, I only found that +0 ._.)

---
 **[Red melee units](https://i.imgur.com/aNF4Pb5.jpg)**
---
Notes:

&gt; The category with the most amount of units.

Notable units:
&gt; * Ayra with DC. Non-DC Ayra can reach really high speeds that prevents her from being doubled, but she will still die with 2 hits so it's no problem. Sometimes, she can survive, but a SB spread can fix that. However, DC Ayra is build to sustain range attacks. If I fail to kill her in the first 2 hits, it's game over. Simply put, Setsuna can't survive a Regnal Astra with Wrath. So she must die on the first two hits.

&gt; * OG Chrom. [A fully built Chrom hits like a truck.](https://i.imgur.com/2u61gCx.png) If any of those Chrom's had something like Glimmer, I would be dead for sure. This gets worse if they are next to someone which I believe it's the case in one of those Chroms.

&gt; * It's not common to see OG Chrom with anything but Aether because he comes with that skill, but Seliph is the same as Chrom. [A bulky unit with high defense and HP.](https://i.imgur.com/zK1qUDj.png) His weapon encourages to use DC so a high merged Seliph will always come with DC.

&gt; * The rarest unit here is...you guess it: Saber and to an extend, Athena. I wasn't able to find a merged Saber so when this +0 appeared, I said, *fuck it!*. For Athena, I went 2 weeks without finding one and then suddenly on one day I found like 5. Pretty weird.

&gt; * Also, Karla, Ayra, Mia, Lyn and Lon'qu. With those units, the goal should be to kill them in two hits and not let them double you because trying to double them is simply not worth the effort.

---
 **[Blue melee units](https://i.imgur.com/XCAGPhs.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; The Blue melee pool is filled with bulky units. While bulk is good, even a 40 defense unit takes 10+ damage per arrow. That's 30+ dmg + one arrow dealing 50% of their defense. It's hard to tank that damage without the help of buffs and/or defensive tiles, which is what I think everyone uses when tanking a brave bow user in the Arena.

&gt;You would think Fjorm is safe because of Ice Mirror, but she still dies on the first 2 hits even after reducing the first attack to 70%.

Notable units:
&gt; * Shiro, Donnel and Oboro are super tanky units. We get [President Oboro's here, relative speedy donnels and.. holy shit double def tactics Shiro's!!!](https://i.imgur.com/jSkZMd7.png) Although being honest, I'm just going to assume that was the only lvl 3 spare seal he had.

&gt; * Lukas. Now, I do agree that Lukas is a physical **melee** god tank, but all we need is just a few SB and Luna to take him down. Getting him in the Arena is a pretty fun puzzle to solve as I will show later.

&gt; * In the blue pool we have Lancina, Charlotte and Nephenee. All 3 are kinda fast units, but even though Charlotte has high HP, her defenses are lacking which results in dead by 2 arrows. Lancina is fast, but also lacking on defenses and she is more of a support unit because of her prf weapon. The real deal here is Nephenee.

&gt; * Nephenee is fast, has really good defenses, comes with Wrath and Slaying Lance. This means almost every Nephenee you get in the Arena will be able to retaliate with a OHKO if you fail to KO her in your turn. Sure, I didn't had any problems with the Nephenee's shown, but that was because I didn't showed you the other Nephenee's I failed to kill in 1 round because of other units getting in the way, unable to move her from a defensive tile, etc.

&gt; * S!Robin takes the medal for the rarest unit in this category.

---
 **[Green melee units](https://i.imgur.com/VFOevuR.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; More tanks here. With the exception of B!Ike and maybe Dorcas, there's not a lot of units that need SB to be taken down in one round.

Notable units:

&gt; * B!Ike. Same reasons as Sigurd. He is just annoying to deal with thanks to Urvan. He is another one of those units that I need to take out my calculator to see if he needs SB, Luna..or again: "*Fuck it, I'm sure he will die to a full quad.*"

&gt; * Raven. If he is not running double LnD memes, [he can be quite hard to take down.](https://i.imgur.com/h78z7xE.png) Again, if that special was something like Glimmer, I would have died.

&gt; * Dorcas and Hawkeye. Never realized how similar these two units were until now. [Yea, Dorcas has more def, but Hawkeye has more balanced defenses.](https://i.imgur.com/kI9LVZm.png)

&gt; * Barst and Bartre lived up as units that even though they are used as memes, people really do use them and +10 them.

&gt; * Summer Xander takes the medal here as the rarest unit in this category. It's funny because when I started editing the screenshots, I noticed I had 3 Summer Xanders, but then realized it was actually the same team I encountered 3 times. So yea, thanks to that one person running his +4 Summer Xander.

---
 **[Red ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/WxSIHnd.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; Now that we enter the ranged category, things get simple. With the exception of a few units, mages have the stats to battle other mages. With average HP and low defenses, they don't have the stats to tank physical hits.

Notable units:
&gt;* Julius. Usually, you just don't care if the units have buffs or if they are on a defensive tile, but [I was surprised to see how tanky this Julius was](https://i.imgur.com/VeXdEON.png) despite only having 19 def. I guess Dull Range + Loptous + DD is one hell of a combo.

&gt; * Sophia, Henry and Lyon being the only major treats as an archer because of how they like to run raven tomes. [Still,
without good defenses and TA, they will not survive.](https://i.imgur.com/PlHZ9xm.png)

&gt;* You would think Raigh is the rarest unit, but since he is a f2p friendly unit, people do use +10 Raigh a lot. The rarest for me was actually Katarina.

---
 **[Blue ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/73EFM1F.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; More PP units with M!Robin being the only one that could potentially retaliate.

Notable units:

&gt; * Saias, S!Lucina and Oliver take the cake as the rarest units. Oliver in particular took me days to the point that I started commenting on threads that had Oliver to see if they were running him in their Arena Team. (and it actually worked!)

---
 **[Green ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/TVjgN54.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; More PP units, but a lot of popular raven users here because of their ability to check B!Lyn and Reinhardt.

Notable units:
&gt; * S!Elise. I mentioned that it was impossible to take down a TA + Raven + Bowbreaker Cecilia. The annoying part is that it's hard to deal with her because of her 3 space movement, but with infantry units, it's kinda possible? [That said, this stupid S!Elise took everything to be taken down in one round.](https://i.imgur.com/C9AKKV1.png) That was 2 SB spreads and Luna charged. In a real fight, I would just say fuck it and let F!Kana or Nino deal with her, but since she was the first S!Elise I encountered, I had to do everything to get the kill on her.

&gt; * Inigo. Same reasons as S!Elise. He was more common, [but with effort, he can still be taken down despite running a "*Fuck you B!Lyn build*"](https://i.imgur.com/HPNqBQt.png)

&gt; * Merric. Just a very tanky green unit that doesn't need to run raven tome to tank hits. Can be taken down without SB, but any unit that can bring Setsuna to less than 10 hp is a worth mention.

---
 **[Colorless physical units](https://i.imgur.com/IoLnW81.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; For archers, unless they run Guard Bow, most of them are PP units. Aside from one archer, I find daggers a little bit more scary since they tend to be very bulky.

Notable units:
&gt; * Faye. In the FAIL section, I will show one particular Faye that took everything from me. It didn't feel good to include her kill because even though Setsuna did 100% of the damage, I lost everyone but Azura just because I wanted to take her down which in the end it was just bad. No point on showing how Setsuna can kill everyone if it requires sacrifices to do so.

&gt; * Saizo. This dude is hard to take down. [He can definitely tank the first two hits and retaliate hard.](https://i.imgur.com/rtPyKdS.png)

&gt; * Matthew. This unit has very good defenses and more often than not, the rest of his team synergies well with him, which in the end makes him hard to take down.

&gt; * As for rare units, F!Takumi was the only one that took me effort to find.

---
 **[Colorless magic units](https://i.imgur.com/GQkUEO3.png)**
---
Notes:

&gt; Staves were simply not meant to do battle with physical units. Sure, Azama and Wyrs can tank, but they are not a threat on PP. Healers are only a threat on EP when they run the famous Pain+ builds.

Notable units:

&gt; * A +10 Wrys is kinda rare to find. Lots of +10 four stars, but not a lot of people that five star him.

&gt; * Mist was also a pain to find.

---
So, that is that. All of them taken down by a daydreaming archer and her partner in crime supporting from behind. Doing this took me a month of just going in and out from the Arena Assault. Every time I was home and had some free time, I did like an hour or two of AA hunting while watching a video/movie. The score range for this was between 684-718. I don't know if lowering the score was necessary, but I still tried it.

In the first 2 days I made huge progress, but as days past and the list got shorter and shorter, it became a chore. After a week of searching, [this was the face of the Arena](https://i.imgur.com/34nOYJY.png) Just Armors, Dragons,B!Lyn/Rein and free legendary units.

Every now and then I said to myself...*Fine, I will give that Nowi lead a try.*

&gt; [Baited once](https://i.imgur.com/CV8oe9P.png)

*Dammm....Ok, one more time!*

&gt; [Baited twice](https://i.imgur.com/ehD4sGQ.png)

*OK, I'm done giving these dragon leads the benefit of the doubt.*

[For each day, I had a progress sheet that I made using the FEH tier list creator. So if you are interested to see which units were the rarest to find, here it is.](https://i.imgur.com/D3evPkG.png)

**[The final boss a.k.a triple distance defense Faye](https://i.imgur.com/rB91Pr5.png)**
---
**Closing thoughts and TL;DR:**
-

At this point, there's very little I would change to make her more efficient at taking down tanky units. [I guess I could try to go for a +Atk IV, but I haven't had any luck pulling one.](https://i.imgur.com/yT8VqjJ.png) Still, I'm in no hurry to do so since, aside from hard counters, there's really no unit she can't take down. It's true that new units will keep coming out with better base stats, but [I have a little something stored in my barracks that will help me in the future when that time comes.](https://i.imgur.com/i6wJboX.png) This is the B skill I had in reserved for Azura.

There's also new skills like Odd Attack Wave and Infantry Rush that I'm considering. (Odd attack would replace SB on Setsuna and Infantry Rush will replace Hone Attack on Azura.) I haven't had the time to see if it's indeed worth it or not, but it's an option.

Brazen Atk/Spd is also on the table, but I'm hesitant. It's 2 more atk/spd, but....I don't really need the extra speed and although 2 attack can translate into 2-8 extra attack, I need to find a way to force her into Brazen/desp range before the battle starts. 41 speed is not enough to double important units. A speedy F!Kana and F!Corrin can reach 40-43 speed. Hell, 37 Spd is not uncommon on the rest of the dragon units. If I fail the kill on the first 2 shots, I will eat QR and die. The best way would be to use Ardent Sacrifice/Recirprocal Aid and.....maaaan I don't want to use those skills. I guess the problem is that I'm so accustom to enter desperation range with LnD that anything that changes the way I play makes me not particularly excited.

In the future I would like to do this again, but with a different build. I would love to do something with Guard Bow and Clarisse Bow.

* [I want to try this build with Guard Bow.](https://imgur.com/a/Wnd2ocZ) (Haven't pulled the trigger on CC since I'm still testing the build, special and what skills Azura would need to support her.)

* [As for Clarisse Bow+, it intrigues me to see what she can do with a 53/53 atk/spd or 62/55 atk/spd with Azura next to her.](https://i.imgur.com/WWj7J92.png)

**TL;DR:**

* [Azura goes...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcCGKrYgr0k&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39s) (Just imagine Rein being Setsuna, Widow being AY!Tiki/red armor unit I want her to tank/kill and McCree just a random unit waiting in line to be killed by Setsuna.) Ana main, btw.

* [Setsuna goes Pew, Pew, Pew, Pew...](https://youtu.be/0XdD2-c_KlM?t=1s) and everything dies.

Here's the 259+ units that died by her hand/bow:

* [Armor units](https://i.imgur.com/cz0hzfZ.jpg)

If you read the whole post.........holy shit O.o thank you! If you just read the TL;DR, thank you as well for stopping by! I hope that at least you laughed at some of the fails and I hope that the story of my 28 base atk Archer motivates you to use your favorite unit regardless of tier, stats and IV's. If you are looking to be the best of the best, it's cool as well. Tier 19.5 might be the best my team could reach because of BST, but atm, there's really nothing that motivates me on using 3 high BST F2P friendly units to stay on tier 20.

You would think I'm insane for writing 35k+ words on what is just a cookie cutter brave bow build (and holy shit, I do agree it was insane), but I just wanted to do something special with my all-time favorite unit in this game. Thank you for reading and if you notice a unit I missed, please let me know.

Good day!

A Setsuna/Azura duo showcase. So this is a showcase on Setsuna and her partner Azura. (**WARNING:** *This guy is obsessed with Setsuna, so it's going to be a loooong post. I will try to add a TL;DR at the bottom..if I remember ._.*)

Since Setsuna is my favorite character in this game, I wanted to do something special with her once I reached +10 on her. This is a showcase of the potential a unit can have given enough support and investment.

---
**[Azura+1 (+Atk -Hp)](https://i.imgur.com/FjJIyXE.png)**
-
&gt; Got lucky with her IV and I will probably only change it if I get a +Spd.

I was very happy when [her and Ryoma](https://i.imgur.com/EOeQIDv.png) appeared almost back to back on the first Hero Fest. Didn't know anything about her at the time besides the fact that she was the face of fates. She became Setsuna's partner and since then I don't think I have ever field one unit without the other.

Her job is dancing Setsuna around the map, buffing her at the start of the turn and tanking red armor units (or A!Tiki) with the goal of either killing them or bringing them down for Setsuna to KO.

* **Weapon: Slaying Lance (Spd)**
&gt;Now, even though Azura only tanks red units, I still prefer having slaying lance on her instead of her default weapon. The simple reason is that....gem weapons are just boring and on the hands of the AI it's just a free kill.

* **Assist: Sing**
&gt;Yup.

* **Special: Moonbow**
&gt;Thanks to Slaying Lance, she gets instant moonbow on the EP.  If I can get more SB fodder, I would gladly give it to her and change her special for that instant Luna in EP.

* **A skill: Fury**
&gt;In place until I can get another B!Ike. I just hate Fury with passion at this point. Maybe even TA for the time being even though I also hate it.

* **B skill: Wings of Mercy 3**
&gt;I don't think I need to explain it, but I don't use it that much anymore and I'm trying not to rely on it. I have a special skill reserved for her in the future that I will show later.

* **C skill: Hone Attack**
&gt; Key skill

* **Seal: Drive Attack 2**
&gt; Another key skill. Before the Drive Attack seal, she had Fortify Res 3 to give 2 buffs to Nino, but since I'm splitting the team, I decided for this change.

So in short words: "dance and tank red threats", but the most important aspect of Azura is that she gives +2 all stats to Setsuna as her partner, +4 atk with Hone and +3 drive atk. All of this sums to 57-58 atk on Setsuna. I obviously have to close to Azura for this to work, but it's never been a problem. These two formations are the ones I use to gain those stats:

* [57 attack on Setsuna](https://i.imgur.com/VHsY9cD.png)

* [58 attack on Setsuna](https://i.imgur.com/JaqHeTx.png)

I'm using Azura because I like her and she is a singer, but as you can see, this is something that any unit can do and it's not something exclusive to her.

---
**[Setsuna+10 (+Spd -Res)](https://i.imgur.com/SnaDPpX.png)**
-
&gt;As everyone knows, Setsuna has a 28 base atk. That is the 18th lowest (out of 94) for range units and 2nd lowest (out of 21) for archers and my choice for IV went to +Spd. Yea, it's super low, but after this you will realize how little I care and why I'm not in a hurry to change it to +Atk.

She is the star of this game for me. Having never played a FE game before Heroes I didn't know her at all. After looking at her art/sprite/VA she instantly became my favorite unit. She began as a reliable Takumi counter thanks to her Bowbreaker in the pre-SI era and when SI came she started to shine even more with each passing update.

* **Weapon: Brave Bow+**
&gt; You would think Low mt + low base atk would the ingredients for a bad weapon choice, but thanks to the rest of her skills, she reaches a nice attack stat and with a 40 base spd she reaches 46 atk on her own and 47-48 spd if Azura is near her.

* **Assist: Reposition**
&gt;I still have a lot of merges to go on Azura before considering giving up Repo for a dual rally skill so..yea.

* **Special: Luna**
&gt;The best special for this build. On the very first battle, Luna will always proc on the 4th hit (if it even gets to that point) or on the 3rd hit. (after tanking 1 hit from the enemy)

* **A skill: Life and Death**
&gt; Just a solid stat boost to Atk that also negates the penalty of the Brave Bow+. With this skill, her physical bulk is 69 while her magical bulk is 67. Letting her get hit by a melee unit is a valid move that I use to charge Luna and kill those WF units in two hits.

* **B skill: Desperation**
&gt; This is just a great skill. Useless when the enemy can't retaliate, but when it does, she will tank the hit like a champ and from that point onward she will quad anything before there's any type of retaliation. Not a fan of using assist skills like Ardent Sacrifice or Reciprocal Aid because as long as she can tank a hit, she will enter Desperation range.

* **C skill: Savage Blow**
&gt; For the longest time, I had no idea what to do with her C slot. I tried Threathen Defense 3, but found it unreliable to proc when I needed it the most (Except with armor units). Then I started using Savage blow on GHB and realized how good of a skill it was. Simply put, if there's no vantage involved I can hit for 7-21+ dmg to a tanky unit so that I can get the kill in 2 hits. Even when vantage is present, I just need to be careful. Overall, savage blow is a great C skill for her. As for other options, I tried pulling S!Al**ph**onse for his Def Smoke, but decided it wasn't a good skill on her.

* **Seal: Attack+3**
&gt;This is just more attack for Setsuna. The only way I would change it is if IS releases a Desperation or Guard Seal.

The idea **on paper** is simple. I buff Setsuna with Hone, Drive and Ally support for that sweet 57-58 atk and she deletes everything in her path. Then I use Azura to dance for an extra kill or reposition her to safety. **In practice**, it's a little bit more complicated than that. (makes it more fun!) I have been Setsuna through out all the metas, (so OHKO, Horse and now Dragon/Armor emblem, AKA EP meta) and the last one is the most interesting and fun to deal with as a player phase unit.

---
Now that I explained the builds, it's time to show how this goes on practice. At this point I guess everyone is sick of cookie cutter builds, so this is why I wanted to do a little bit more than just a textbook showcase. If you are a new player and you wonder why people say brave weapons/dire thunder trivializes the game, I will show you now. So I decided to put Setsuna and Azura against the entire summonable cast of FEH. **This was done with Setsuna doing 100% of the damage and Azura only acting as support.** There were no other units or any other skill involved besides the ones shown.

There was only one rule:

* "**Only Setsuna is allow to do damage and she can only attack the enemy once.**"

So I can't attack and then dance for a second round. That would make things too easy. Savage blow is fair game and entering combat (but not attacking) is fair game as well.

So yea, sounds simple right? Well...eventually, I started coming up with complicated rules to make things as fair as possible, but then decided not to enforced them. Rules such as:

* "NO defensive tiles"

I wanted the 1v1 to be fair, but you will never know the pain that is searching hours upon hours for specific units and when you finally find the unit, you are not able to screenshot a clean kill because the enemy refuses to leave the defensive tile. [These maps were the biggest offenders](https://i.imgur.com/9Y5bbwR.png) (with the zipper and island map being the worse for anything that wasn't a horse). Eventually I came to realize the rule was stupid because even if the enemy or Setsuna was in a defensive tile, the outcome of the battle would have been the same. So I decided to **avoid defensive tiles as much as possible and in the un-avoidable cases, I made sure that the end result wouldn't be affected in either way.** I added a small icon next to the units name just to show when a defensive tile took place.

* "Only use Savage Blow on units that require SB dmg for the kill"

Savage Blow is a key skill that is used against the bulkiest units in the game. I tried my hardest to not abuse it on units that didn't required it for the kill, but I ran into situations that just made me want to rage quit. I was having a hard time getting clean kills because of other units getting in the way. It was the pain of searching for days for a +10 merged un-common unit and not being able to get a clean kill because of a stupid Reinhardt getting in the way. So I said to myself:  regardless if the unit was missing 7-14 HP, it would have been a kill in either the first 2 shots or the 3rd (after tanking 1 hit if the unit had DC). So yea, regardless if the units was missing HP, it was still dmg done only by Setsuna and if you do the math, every missing HP is divisible by 7 to show that. (All except for [that fully buffed Iote +10 Subaki](https://i.imgur.com/a/vigzEkR.png) in which he attacked Fjorm and lost 3 HP. I just wanted to put him because that was one of the hardest flying units I dealt with in this experiment.)

So yea...there's **259+** units so that's a lot of units to find and kill. I divided them in different categories. (Initially I wanted to just make a big picture, but I can't make a picture that big on MS Paint ._.) (All the units shown are pre-summer banner. So no Summer Cordelia, Tana, Innes and Noire. The last unit I added was Canas.)

---
 **[Armor units](https://i.imgur.com/cz0hzfZ.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt;So yea, armor units are meta, but if there's **NO** vantage on the enemy team, Setsuna can just go to town. As long as I keep the units off the defensive tiles, I don't care about the order in which I kill units and [I can take a hit because it allows me to enter desperation range for the next fight.](https://i.imgur.com/bkroRDE.png) (So bold/vengeful fighter/QR are irrelevant.)

&gt;If there's a unit with **Wary Fighter and DC**, most of the time I won't be able to kill the unit in two hits, so I have to play around Luna for that. I will target another unit and make sure I ORKO in 2-3 hits. With this I will have Luna at 1 (or charged) which guarantees the KO in two hits.

&gt;If I face a combination of **both vantage and WF+DC units**, I will carefully plan out which units to take out. This is by far the hardest fights, but thankfully very few teams run several units with vantage. Simply because everyone prefers the higher SP fighter skills. Vantage is only common on units like Hector and BK for some reason.

Notable units:

&gt; * I do get Omnibreak Hector from time to time, but they can be dealt with some SB spread to break the riposte [or just having Luna at 1 or charged.](https://i.imgur.com/L0IhkrF.png) (If I have it at 2 and no other unit to attack, I can let Hector hit me to charge it.)

&gt; * Since Armor units are meta, I really didn't had much trouble finding each of them. I think the hardest to find were Zephiel and Arden. I only found like 2 of each in all my tries. There's only 1 Arden there because the other one destroyed me.. (As I will show in the FAIL section.)

---
 **[Dragon units](https://i.imgur.com/3dMK2Zk.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt;Dragon units are also meta with the majority of them running the SB/WB/DC, QR, Aether build. As long as I take them off defensive tiles, they will die to a quad. If Luna is at 1 or charged, they die on 2 hits. Otherwise Setsuna will tank the hit and enter desperation range and kill the rest of them. The only thing that could maybe prevent Setsuna from tanking a hit is if the dragon activates a 4+ special after two hits with the help of infantry pulse + QP seal. That's in theory because I never encountered that situation since Aether just scores better at the Arena.

&gt;Another good thing about Setsuna is that she doesn't have unbalanced defenses. Her Res and Def are pretty much the same, so in the end it doesn't matter which stat they target.

Notable units:
&gt; * Myrrh, in my eyes, is the scariest dragon in the game to face as a PP archer. Her end-game build basically behaves as a Wary Fighter + Distant Counter + Quick Riposte armor unit with 2 space movement that flies and ignores terrain. (*Who thought that was a good idea?!*) I need to either damage her for 14 dmg or blow her up with a 2 hit Luna proc. It's not hard to pull this on armor units because they are too slow to reach you (Armor march is not an issue since you can separate units and blow the armor march user first.) and that gives you enough time to plan ahead, but Myrrh doesn't give a shit. She comes right to your face ignoring terrain and since Azura is always near Setsuna, you can guess who Myrrh targets right away. Thankfully, the AI sucks at using assist skills so she is always the target of a repo/draw back which makes life a little bit easier.

&gt; * M!Grima was scary when he came out, but in the end he's just a slow armor. He, alongside Nowi, are the most common dragon units.

&gt; * F!Grima is also interesting, but Dragonskin is not really enough to save her from a quad.

---
 **[Flying units w/o Iote's Shield](https://i.imgur.com/XlR6wNZ.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt;So yea, we all know what happens to Flying units without Iote Shield. :(

Notable units:
&gt;* Took me some time to find a S!Camilla that wasn't running the TA, Raven, Iote shield build....

&gt; * I'm also grateful that archers don't have to worry about flying mages, because they [sure hit super hard.](https://i.imgur.com/CY7ncWd.png)

---
 **[Flying units with Iote's Shield](https://i.imgur.com/fvLXi6N.png)**
---
Notes:
&gt; So yea, even with Iote Shield most fliers still can't survive a quad. Iote does help for non-brave weapons, but since they get doubled, it's still a lot of damage to take in. Iote shield works better on the bulkiest fliers. With those, I do have to plan a little bit with Savage Blow.

Notable units:
&gt; * [This Beruka was hands down insane to take down in one round](https://i.imgur.com/b9cOX7R.png). Luna did 34 dmg so a quad was 46 dmg total. With 55 total HP, I needed 2 savage blow to bring her into ORKO. That one was difficult since she also had an ally with fortify fliers which brought her defense to 60. A quad with that defense is only 28 damage.

&gt; * [This Subaki was the only +10 I was able to find](https://i.imgur.com/rcLKMN1.png) and he was also a pain to kill in 1 round. The differences between him and Beruka is that he can reach a Spd threshold which makes it hard to quad. I made a mistake and he lost 3 HP in a battle against Fjorm, but it was still overkill when Setsuna attacked.

&gt; * As for rare units, I would say Narcian was the rarest flying unit with NY!Camilla coming in second.

---
 **[Cavalry melee units](https://i.imgur.com/Brq8026.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; Initially I thought horses were popular, but unless the bonus unit of the week has melee horses, I don't find them that much in the Arena. It seems few people have them on their Arena core. Very few of them required SB to take down in one round and not a lot of them run DC to fight back.

Notable units:

&gt; * The most annoying horse to take down in one round is non-DC Sigurd because of his ability to reduce consecutive attacks by 80%. Depending on his defense I have to see if he needs SB, Luna or if I can just bypass it by saying: "*fuck it, he will die with the quad*". He's not scary, just very annoying to deal with.

&gt; * When I started this project, Ares recently came out so I wasn't able to find a fully built Ares, but I would say that a DC Ares on vantage range and with Special ready to use is scary.

&gt; * If you can't separate Eldigan and Exalted Chrom from the rest of the team, they will be incredibly hard to deal with. These two gave me the most trouble in the Arena because of their high defense and hp.

&gt;* This category holds the holy trinity of the rarest units in the game for me. These units are Clive, Spring Xander and Luke. I have something special reserved for Clive and Spring Xander because I want to thank the users that use them on their team, but if you saw my kill on Luke you will notice it's the Luke from the Double Chain challenge on Lunatic.

&gt;* Let me level with you...**nobody, I repeat, nobody** runs Luke on the Arena. I have been spamming AA for hours for almost a month and I was able to find every single unit at different merges, but I was never able to find a Luke. There was [this guy that had a Luke, but it was on beginner and it wasn't even level 40.](https://i.imgur.com/lNHc7tJ.png) I encountered him twice and it doesn't seem the guy still plays because it was still lvl 34. If you want more proof, just check [The 5* Lv.40+10 Build Compendium](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/wiki/meta/5-star-lv-40-plus-10-build-compendium). The +10 Luke is just a vanilla one without any additional skills. It just screams "*someone do a +10 for the compendium's sake!!!! Please!!*" So yea, I was never able to find a Luke at my score range. (It doesn't help that at higher scores, horses just disappear so yea..) If I ever find him, I will just edit the image, but I have been postponing this for weeks and frankly, at this point, I don't care.

&gt;* Cain and Abel..also pretty rare to find, but I was able to find the two in one fight. (More at the bottom of the thread.)

---
 **[Cavalry ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/923Vehv.jpg)**
---
Notes:

&gt;One of the most popular categories because of Reinhardt and B!Lyn. With melee units, I don't have a problem on letting Setsuna tank a hit to charge my Luna, but with ranged units we now get Blizzard, Blade tomes, Dazzling staffs, etc. Some of those weapon will OHKO her if I let her take the hit. So this category is just PP all the way on them.

Notable units:
&gt; * Cecilia hands down. [I can take down a raven tome Cecilia](https://i.imgur.com/Li2LYPM.png), a Raven with bowbreaker...maybe with SB and a Luna, but a Raven+TA+Bowbreaker/QR...yea, not a chance. With blade tome, she is still scary [if you engage her with buffs.](https://i.imgur.com/Mpernjy.png) Since she is a 3 star unit, if you get her in the Arena, it's a guaranteed +10 with 50/50 on blade or raven tome.

&gt; * The rarest units in this category are Nana and WoT!Olwen. (I lost a screenshot of a +10 Green Olwen and spend 2 days searching for another one...In the end, I only found that +0 ._.)

---
 **[Red melee units](https://i.imgur.com/aNF4Pb5.jpg)**
---
Notes:

&gt; The category with the most amount of units.

Notable units:
&gt; * Ayra with DC. Non-DC Ayra can reach really high speeds that prevents her from being doubled, but she will still die with 2 hits so it's no problem. Sometimes, she can survive, but a SB spread can fix that. However, DC Ayra is build to sustain range attacks. If I fail to kill her in the first 2 hits, it's game over. Simply put, Setsuna can't survive a Regnal Astra with Wrath. So she must die on the first two hits.

&gt; * OG Chrom. [A fully built Chrom hits like a truck.](https://i.imgur.com/2u61gCx.png) If any of those Chrom's had something like Glimmer, I would be dead for sure. This gets worse if they are next to someone which I believe it's the case in one of those Chroms.

&gt; * It's not common to see OG Chrom with anything but Aether because he comes with that skill, but Seliph is the same as Chrom. [A bulky unit with high defense and HP.](https://i.imgur.com/zK1qUDj.png) His weapon encourages to use DC so a high merged Seliph will always come with DC.

&gt; * The rarest unit here is...you guess it: Saber and to an extend, Athena. I wasn't able to find a merged Saber so when this +0 appeared, I said, *fuck it!*. For Athena, I went 2 weeks without finding one and then suddenly on one day I found like 5. Pretty weird.

&gt; * Also, Karla, Ayra, Mia, Lyn and Lon'qu. With those units, the goal should be to kill them in two hits and not let them double you because trying to double them is simply not worth the effort.

---
 **[Blue melee units](https://i.imgur.com/XCAGPhs.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; The Blue melee pool is filled with bulky units. While bulk is good, even a 40 defense unit takes 10+ damage per arrow. That's 30+ dmg + one arrow dealing 50% of their defense. It's hard to tank that damage without the help of buffs and/or defensive tiles, which is what I think everyone uses when tanking a brave bow user in the Arena.

&gt;You would think Fjorm is safe because of Ice Mirror, but she still dies on the first 2 hits even after reducing the first attack to 70%.

Notable units:
&gt; * Shiro, Donnel and Oboro are super tanky units. We get [President Oboro's here, relative speedy donnels and.. holy shit double def tactics Shiro's!!!](https://i.imgur.com/jSkZMd7.png) Although being honest, I'm just going to assume that was the only lvl 3 spare seal he had.

&gt; * Lukas. Now, I do agree that Lukas is a physical **melee** god tank, but all we need is just a few SB and Luna to take him down. Getting him in the Arena is a pretty fun puzzle to solve as I will show later.

&gt; * In the blue pool we have Lancina, Charlotte and Nephenee. All 3 are kinda fast units, but even though Charlotte has high HP, her defenses are lacking which results in dead by 2 arrows. Lancina is fast, but also lacking on defenses and she is more of a support unit because of her prf weapon. The real deal here is Nephenee.

&gt; * Nephenee is fast, has really good defenses, comes with Wrath and Slaying Lance. This means almost every Nephenee you get in the Arena will be able to retaliate with a OHKO if you fail to KO her in your turn. Sure, I didn't had any problems with the Nephenee's shown, but that was because I didn't showed you the other Nephenee's I failed to kill in 1 round because of other units getting in the way, unable to move her from a defensive tile, etc.

&gt; * S!Robin takes the medal for the rarest unit in this category.

 **[Green melee units](https://i.imgur.com/VFOevuR.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; More tanks here. With the exception of B!Ike and maybe Dorcas, there's not a lot of units that need SB to be taken down in one round.

Notable units:

&gt; * B!Ike. Same reasons as Sigurd. He is just annoying to deal with thanks to Urvan. He is another one of those units that I need to take out my calculator to see if he needs SB, Luna..or again: "*Fuck it, I'm sure he will die to a full quad.*"

&gt; * Raven. If he is not running double LnD memes, [he can be quite hard to take down.](https://i.imgur.com/h78z7xE.png) Again, if that special was something like Glimmer, I would have died.

&gt; * Dorcas and Hawkeye. Never realized how similar these two units were until now. [Yea, Dorcas has more def, but Hawkeye has more balanced defenses.](https://i.imgur.com/kI9LVZm.png)

&gt; * Barst and Bartre lived up as units that even though they are used as memes, people really do use them and +10 them.

&gt; * Summer Xander takes the medal here as the rarest unit in this category. It's funny because when I started editing the screenshots, I noticed I had 3 Summer Xanders, but then realized it was actually the same team I encountered 3 times. So yea, thanks to that one person running his +4 Summer Xander.

 **[Red ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/WxSIHnd.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; Now that we enter the ranged category, things get simple. With the exception of a few units, mages have the stats to battle other mages. With average HP and low defenses, they don't have the stats to tank physical hits.

Notable units:
&gt;* Julius. Usually, you just don't care if the units have buffs or if they are on a defensive tile, but [I was surprised to see how tanky this Julius was](https://i.imgur.com/VeXdEON.png) despite only having 19 def. I guess Dull Range + Loptous + DD is one hell of a combo.

&gt; * Sophia, Henry and Lyon being the only major treats as an archer because of how they like to run raven tomes. [Still,
without good defenses and TA, they will not survive.](https://i.imgur.com/PlHZ9xm.png)

&gt;* You would think Raigh is the rarest unit, but since he is a f2p friendly unit, people do use +10 Raigh a lot. The rarest for me was actually Katarina.

---
 **[Blue ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/73EFM1F.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; More PP units with M!Robin being the only one that could potentially retaliate.

Notable units:

&gt; * Saias, S!Lucina and Oliver take the cake as the rarest units. Oliver in particular took me days to the point that I started commenting on threads that had Oliver to see if they were running him in their Arena Team. (and it actually worked!)

---
 **[Green ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/TVjgN54.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; More PP units, but a lot of popular raven users here because of their ability to check B!Lyn and Reinhardt.

Notable units:
&gt; * S!Elise. I mentioned that it was impossible to take down a TA + Raven + Bowbreaker Cecilia. The annoying part is that it's hard to deal with her because of her 3 space movement, but with infantry units, it's kinda possible? [That said, this stupid S!Elise took everything to be taken down in one round.](https://i.imgur.com/C9AKKV1.png) That was 2 SB spreads and Luna charged. In a real fight, I would just say fuck it and let F!Kana or Nino deal with her, but since she was the first S!Elise I encountered, I had to do everything to get the kill on her.

&gt; * Inigo. Same reasons as S!Elise. He was more common, [but with effort, he can still be taken down despite running a "*Fuck you B!Lyn build*"](https://i.imgur.com/HPNqBQt.png)

&gt; * Merric. Just a very tanky green unit that doesn't need to run raven tome to tank hits. Can be taken down without SB, but any unit that can bring Setsuna to less than 10 hp is a worth mention.

---
 **[Colorless physical units](https://i.imgur.com/IoLnW81.jpg)**
---
Notes:
&gt; For archers, unless they run Guard Bow, most of them are PP units. Aside from one archer, I find daggers a little bit more scary since they tend to be very bulky.

Notable units:
&gt; * Faye. In the FAIL section, I will show one particular Faye that took everything from me. It didn't feel good to include her kill because even though Setsuna did 100% of the damage, I lost everyone but Azura just because I wanted to take her down which in the end it was just bad. No point on showing how Setsuna can kill everyone if it requires sacrifices to do so.

&gt; * Saizo. This dude is hard to take down. [He can definitely tank the first two hits and retaliate hard.](https://i.imgur.com/rtPyKdS.png)

&gt; * Matthew. This unit has very good defenses and more often than not, the rest of his team synergies well with him, which in the end makes him hard to take down.

&gt; * As for rare units, F!Takumi was the only one that took me effort to find.

---
 **[Colorless magic units](https://i.imgur.com/GQkUEO3.png)**
---
Notes:

&gt; Staves were simply not meant to do battle with physical units. Sure, Azama and Wyrs can tank, but they are not a threat on PP. Healers are only a threat on EP when they run the famous Pain+ builds.

Notable units:

&gt; * A +10 Wrys is kinda rare to find. Lots of +10 four stars, but not a lot of people that five star him.

&gt; * Mist was also a pain to find.

---
So, that is that. All of them taken down by a daydreaming archer and her partner in crime supporting from behind. Doing this took me a month of just going in and out from the Arena Assault. Every time I was home and had some free time, I did like an hour or two of AA hunting while watching a video/movie. The score range for this was between 684-718. I don't know if lowering the score was necessary, but I still tried it.

In the first 2 days I made huge progress, but as days past and the list got shorter and shorter, it became a chore. After a week of searching, [this was the face of the Arena](https://i.imgur.com/34nOYJY.png) Just Armors, Dragons,B!Lyn/Rein and free legendary units.

Every now and then I said to myself...*Fine, I will give that Nowi lead a try.*

&gt; [Baited once](https://i.imgur.com/CV8oe9P.png)

*Dammm....Ok, one more time!*

&gt; [Baited twice](https://i.imgur.com/ehD4sGQ.png)

*OK, I'm done giving these dragon leads the benefit of the doubt.*

[For each day, I had a progress sheet that I made using the FEH tier list creator. So if you are interested to see which units were the rarest to find, here it is.](https://i.imgur.com/D3evPkG.png)

**Teams I wanted to mention because of the units they ran**

* [The 1st of the holy trinity of rare cavalry units, Clive. Thank you "NMCJ Alexa" for running him on your team.](https://imgur.com/a/DjfxWtI)

* [The 2nd of the holy trinity of rare cavalry units, Spring Xander. Sadly, I dont know how to pronounce his name, but thanks anyway.](https://imgur.com/a/hqJ2RDZ)

* [My first Arthur after a week of searching. The best, indeed.](https://imgur.com/a/qtGiuKa)

* [Found my first Barst, but after entering, this team had 3 other units I was missing. I don't know how to call this, FE1 or Shadow dragon team?](https://imgur.com/a/HAwfBr9)

* [My first and only Oliver provided by user /u/True Beauty. It's sad that Oliver is not a popular unit and the memes are just memes.](https://imgur.com/a/EnRGnKX)

* [My first Bartre sight.](https://i.imgur.com/a/11LebWX.png)

---
**Some teams from users on this sub..(I think) and some teams that had funny names.**

* [Murdering TT Loki.](https://i.imgur.com/PGUH3Rb.png)

* [Legendary Ryoma on his map surviving the OHKO.](https://i.imgur.com/yxcT8kH.png)

---
**This is the part everyone wants to see: FAILS, FAILS and more FAILS! Because, yea..nothing is perfect.**
---

* [Failing to ORKO Surtr from the double chapter Lunatic](https://i.imgur.com/2TT2YEy.png)

* [SB + WF + DD 52 def W!Chrom.](https://i.imgur.com/akgUN45.png)

* [Double defense fortress and Guard 51 def Gordin.](https://i.imgur.com/2kp9zaI.png)

* [For the people saying Savage Blow sucks because of vantage...yea, sometimes I stop paying attention and this happens.](https://i.imgur.com/G3HtD7g.png)

* [Hitting a Boey with 3 Savage blow spreads and he still survives. 58 atk is 35 atk against his 35 def...yea.](https://i.imgur.com/88BE4SZ.png)

* [This was the last time I used Oboro. I was already having problems with trying to have units off defense tiles and she hits him with her Panic Ploy. I changed to Fjorm after this. At least I can get away from her Drive Atk](https://i.imgur.com/P9Bwlxd.png)

* [Another Raven + TA + QR mage. Trying to land 3 SB on this map is a nightmare.](https://i.imgur.com/fZuodKa.png)

* [F!Corrin with Bowbreaker. Even with 2 SB on her, her 46 def was too much to take down in 2 hits. Maybe if I had Luna, things could have been different](https://i.imgur.com/lMLpeZI.png)

* [One of my failed attempts at killing Lukas with Setsuna in one round.](https://imgur.com/a/wkF3tLJ)

* [In some cases, why even bother...](https://i.imgur.com/4H9i6jf.png)

* [Moments like these are were I wished I had a +Atk IV](https://i.imgur.com/AyQvgTl.png)

* [Failing to kill a Raven S!Camilla in one round. Had to tank a hit first.](https://i.imgur.com/sCewBWt.png)

* [A fail thanks to Bowbreaker..again. Not even a charged Luna could kill him.](https://i.imgur.com/RQjIGkT.png)

* [This was the first Arden I came up and I couldn't kill him no matter how hard I tried. I had to play perfectly to hit him with 4 SB spreads, but failed to do so. This was the only moment in the whole experiment where I felt utterly useless.](https://i.imgur.com/KqS26NV.png)

* [Trying to take down a +10 51 def Subaki. I don't know why I attempted this in the first place. I guess I could have waited for the buff to go off, but then I would have to worry about the defensive tiles and the rest of the team nearing my position.](https://i.imgur.com/tFoNOhl.png)

* [This is why I hate Sigurd. Reducing a 99 attack to just 36...](https://i.imgur.com/Qrkndl2.png)

* [Not doing the new units, I just want this to be done.](https://i.imgur.com/CFi5xcB.png)

**[The final boss a.k.a triple distance defense Faye](https://i.imgur.com/rB91Pr5.png)**
---
**Closing thoughts and TL;DR:**
-

At this point, there's very little I would change to make her more efficient at taking down tanky units. [I guess I could try to go for a +Atk IV, but I haven't had any luck pulling one.](https://i.imgur.com/yT8VqjJ.png) Still, I'm in no hurry to do so since, aside from hard counters, there's really no unit she can't take down. It's true that new units will keep coming out with better base stats, but [I have a little something stored in my barracks that will help me in the future when that time comes.](https://i.imgur.com/i6wJboX.png) This is the B skill I had in reserved for Azura.

There's also new skills like Odd Attack Wave and Infantry Rush that I'm considering. (Odd attack would replace SB on Setsuna and Infantry Rush will replace Hone Attack on Azura.) I haven't had the time to see if it's indeed worth it or not, but it's an option.

Brazen Atk/Spd is also on the table, but I'm hesitant. It's 2 more atk/spd, but....I don't really need the extra speed and although 2 attack can translate into 2-8 extra attack, I need to find a way to force her into Brazen/desp range before the battle starts. 41 speed is not enough to double important units. A speedy F!Kana and F!Corrin can reach 40-43 speed. Hell, 37 Spd is not uncommon on the rest of the dragon units. If I fail the kill on the first 2 shots, I will eat QR and die. The best way would be to use Ardent Sacrifice/Recirprocal Aid and.....maaaan I don't want to use those skills. I guess the problem is that I'm so accustom to enter desperation range with LnD that anything that changes the way I play makes me not particularly excited.

In the future I would like to do this again, but with a different build. I would love to do something with Guard Bow and Clarisse Bow.

* [I want to try this build with Guard Bow.](https://imgur.com/a/Wnd2ocZ) (Haven't pulled the trigger on CC since I'm still testing the build, special and what skills Azura would need to support her.)

* [As for Clarisse Bow+, it intrigues me to see what she can do with a 53/53 atk/spd or 62/55 atk/spd with Azura next to her.](https://i.imgur.com/WWj7J92.png)

**TL;DR:**

* [Azura goes...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcCGKrYgr0k&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39s) (Just imagine Rein being Setsuna, Widow being AY!Tiki/red armor unit I want her to tank/kill and McCree just a random unit waiting in line to be killed by Setsuna.) Ana main, btw.

* [Setsuna goes Pew, Pew, Pew, Pew...](https://youtu.be/0XdD2-c_KlM?t=1s) and everything dies.

Here's the 259+ units that died by her hand/bow:

* [Armor units](https://i.imgur.com/cz0hzfZ.jpg)
* [Dragon units](https://i.imgur.com/3dMK2Zk.jpg)
* [Flying units w/o Iote Shield](https://i.imgur.com/XlR6wNZ.jpg)
* [Flying units with Iote Shield](https://i.imgur.com/fvLXi6N.png)
* [Cavalry melee units](https://i.imgur.com/Brq8026.jpg)
* [Cavalry ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/923Vehv.jpg)
* [Red melee units](https://i.imgur.com/aNF4Pb5.jpg)
* [Blue melee units](https://i.imgur.com/XCAGPhs.jpg)
* [Green melee units](https://i.imgur.com/VFOevuR.jpg)
* [Red ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/WxSIHnd.jpg)
* [Blue ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/73EFM1F.jpg)
* [Green ranged units](https://i.imgur.com/TVjgN54.jpg)
* [Colorless physical units](https://i.imgur.com/IoLnW81.jpg)
* [Colorless magic units](https://i.imgur.com/GQkUEO3.png)

If you read the whole post.........holy shit O.o thank you! If you just read the TL;DR, thank you as well for stopping by! I hope that at least you laughed at some of the fails and I hope that the story of my 28 base atk Archer motivates you to use your favorite unit regardless of tier, stats and IV's. If you are looking to be the best of the best, it's cool as well. Tier 19.5 might be the best my team could reach because of BST, but atm, there's really nothing that motivates me on using 3 high BST F2P friendly units to stay on tier 20.

You would think I'm insane for writing 35k+ words on what is just a cookie cutter brave bow build (and holy shit, I do agree it was insane), but I just wanted to do something special with my all-time favorite unit in this game. Thank you for reading and if you notice a unit I missed, please let me know.

Good day!

The Oath Of Mars, Part 5: Capture **Hello, brave readers! Today, we enter the colossal depths of the mysterious 'Mars' Path', alongside the recently indentured Warden and her Conqueror companion.**

[You can find the fanfiction.net link here, if you'd like to follow it or leave a review!](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12970260/5/The-Oath-Of-Mars)

**As always, constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated, and I hope you enjoy...**

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

**The Oath Of Mars, Part 5: Capture**

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

"I appreciate the lack of a gag, at least."

"A gag? Wha' th'hell do they need a gag for? Not exactly like we can call for help, innit?"

"Why do you always put 'innit' on the end of things? It's short for 'isn't it'!"

*"Tacēte, servī!"*

It had been a day and a half, here in the dark. Where were they? They traveled on a great expanse of what looked like shining black glass, and darkness pressed in on all sides. Not even the stars made an appearance. They must be underground, but there was no wall, nor ceiling, in sight. Grumbling, the soldier charged with guarding them looks over her shoulder, trying to glean something from the shadows in boredom, twirling the *pilum* in her hand idly. Leaning over to Garth, she whispers.

*"So, do we actually have a plan, or did you just say that to keep my hopes up?"*

*"Give yer mate some time, these bloody locks are bein' a bastard."*

*"It's been a* day\*, Garth."\*

*"Well, a man's gotta sleep, y'know? Besides I've just..."*

Grunting quietly in frustration, he keeps on working the lock. He used to be the king of picking locks. Now look at him. Conscription does terrible things to a man's sense of subtlety and finesse.

*"...about...got..."*

Then, suddenly, his work was done. His hands were free of the manacles. The lock was open.

Open, with a VERY loud click. One the spear-wielding soldier sitting across from them was very familiar with, from how she whirled around so quickly, weapon at the ready. Shit.

Anna had to think of something. But her hands were bound. What was she to do?

As the *praetorian* rose to deal with the unshackled prisoner, something threw her off guard. The woman to his left suddenly started shaking, as if in a seizure. Her eyes rolled up in her head, and blood came from her mouth!

"**Vah?!**"

In that brief moment of confusion, Garth punched her right off the wagon. He had planned to wait for the opportune moment to escape from his bonds, but it seems that these southerners had been taking prisoners a long, long time. The noise made by the shackles -and the ensuing struggle it caused- had alerted the wagons in front and behind in the wagon train. He had to work quick. Hauling his still bound companion to her feet, he stares at the blood coming from her mouth.

"What in god's name was that?"

"I bit the inside of my cheeks! That and a bit of acting, and suddenly, I'm dying! A serviceable distraction, don't you think?"

Jumping down from the wagon, he fishes around for their unconscious guard's keys, and handed them up to her.

"Where'dya learn that from?!"

"Nowhere! I just thought *'what would lady Elizabeth do'*, and it came to me!"

He looks up and down the cavernous tunnel. Their escape had triggered chaos. As centurions rushed to capture them from the faraway wagons on either side, their captives took the opportunity to enact their own escapes. And, like fire down a line of oil, these escapes set the carriage's down the line panicking in turn. Yet another *'serviceable distraction',* as Garth and Anna sprinted for the darkness.

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

"We... probably should have stolen a lantern or a torch too, huh...?"

Utter, cloying black. They had escaped their pursuers, only to find themselves lost in the dark as well. Anna had believed this place to be a single tunnel, but as they fled, they had found that the central shaft which they had escaped from was simply the core of what seemed like a colossal web of caves.

As they felt their way through the cold shaft of black glass, Anna felt her senses beginning to return. An almost invisible glimmer reflecting of the smooth ground. Light was near.

"Y'know... now that we can relax a bit, I got t'ask... *where'n the hell are we?"*

Rounding a corner, Anna can see light, reflecting off the black glass that formed every surface of these caverns. White light, not the dim glow of flame.

Daylight. They had entered a natural cistern, a gargantuan, spherical chamber with a great crack along the top, allowing light and snowmelt both into the cave, forming a sizable underground lake for the two ashfeldian knights to rest on the shores of. Still winded from her flight from the convoy, Anna all but panted out her reply to Garth's question.

"How... should I know?"

"Well, yer the one always listenin' t' Elizabeth's fancy prattle!"

Sitting down at the edge of the water, disturbing the myriad birds that had come to drink of the water and eat the strange, blind cave-fish that populated it, she caught her breath, and thought for a moment.

"Well... They came from the south. That means they had to find some way through the Skyrakers. This black material... It looks like obsidian."

"Wot now?"

"Obsidian. It's a kind of glass formed when lava cools quickly. The Skyrakers were made by the Cataclysm. When the land pushed itself up to form their slopes, it dredged molten rock up from the depths of the earth. A sea used to be here, so when the lava met the water, it must have cooled extremely quickly, forming all this obsidian. And when the boiling water became steam and tried to escape, it must have formed these tubes and bubbles as it rose and expanded through the lava. These caves... they must thread the whole mountain range."

"Well, if it's always been 'ere, then why are these face-wearin' blokes comin' through now?"

Cupping the cool, clean water of the cistern in her hands, she drinks deeply of the snowmelt, quenching her throat, parched by the hot, moistureless atmosphere of the volcanic caverns. Sighing, she responds.

"It's a common misconception that the Cataclysm is over, or that it was a single event with a beginning and end in the first place. The worst of it occurred all at once, to be sure, but even now, the banks of Ashfeld's rivers wind like serpents on the prowl, and the Myre of the samurai cannot be mapped for how much the ground roils and moves about. Maybe the earth shifts such that the entrance is only open periodically? Or maybe the snow simply buried the mouth until just recently. I cannot know for certain."

"It's a damn shame that th'mountain had t' crack itself open an' let all th'baddies out *now*, of all times. We're already gettin' whipped on all fronts up north."

Standing up, the Warden dusts off her standards.

"All the more reason to find our way out of this blasted pit. We need to get our friends back, and return home. We've both seen what ashfeldian powder charges can do. Reduce castle walls to nothing. Change the shape of cliff faces."

She looks to the sliver of sunlight high above, determination in her eyes.

"Maybe they can seal this place up once more."

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

Mars Quirinus had a headache. She hated headaches.

A nervous soldier stood before her. A *praetorian*, and a Misrian one at that, just like her.

"M-my lady, I tried to..."

She narrows her gaze. The praetorian cringes away from the sight.

"...The woman, she started bleeding at the mouth, as if struck by a southern plague, and I-I..."

"Panicked?"

"N-no! I was just surprised, i-is all..."

She looks to the ground, eyes wide with fear.

"You let two prisoners escape, and who knows how many we lost in the chaos that followed. Do you know what kind of omen this is for the campaign ahead?"

"M-my lady, please-!"

"If I was Mars Gradivus, you'd be in shackles, bound for the fighting pits 'til some other wretched slave gutted you for show."

Rising from her chair, she strides forward till she stood face to sniveling face with the woman.

"If I was Mars Ultor, you'd be flayed alive, salted, and nailed to the cliffside for the sun to bake."

Suddenly, she places a hand on her shoulder, and smiles softly, voice calmer.

"But I'm not Mars Gradivus, and I'm certainly not his bloodthirsty pet weasel. But I can't let you go unpunished. My fellow Aspects would have my head for it. Report to the *lictor* for a dozen lashes."

The hand on her fellow praetorian's shoulder goes now to her own chest, against her heart. She speaks now, softly, in Coptic, the language of their people.

*"Be brave, my sister."*

Staggered by the unexpected mercy, the lower ranking soldier repeats the gesture, and replies in their shared tongue.

*"Th-thank you, master."*

Without another word, the praetorian scurries from the tent, afraid that her good fortune would suddenly be pulled from underneath her.

\-And stumbles right past Mars Ultor himself on the way out.

The waiting Aspect stares down the fleeing soldier wordlessly, then steps inside. He was a thin man, thinner than most in the Empire's army, but the *Salii* preferred agility to raw strength, as evident by his light armor and twin blades. He was a wretched thing, a thin, almost skeletal face with two soulless blue eyes, topped with a chaotic mass of curling blonde hair atop his head.

Eyeing her suspiciously, he hissed, as a viper should.

"There was hope in that *proscriptio's* eyes. What sentence did you hand down, Quirinus?"

"A dozen lashes from a scourge. Her back'll run red."

Scowling, he steps forward angrily.

*"A dozen lashes?! For her idiocy, we lost some of the hostia's finest stock! All we are left now is the weak! The gimps and the cowards! Mars Gradivus will hear of this!"*

Rising from her seat once more, this time with her ornate *pilum* and *scutum* in hand, she stands fast against the cruel sycophant in front of her.

"*I don't care, Ultor.* Gradivus may have taught you otherwise, but the Aspects are equals. I can punish my soldiers as I wish. That is the *emperors will,* and his is the only one I will heed. Your master has not taken the throne yet, and while I breathe, *he* *never will.* Now get out of my sight, before I kill you."

"Y-you dare?!"

He lunges forward-

\-only to be stopped by the point of her spear.

"I do. As long as I breathe, I will fight for the emperor and his line. You mean to betray him, to stab him with knives while he sleeps, like *cowards*. This I know. And you should know that the instant you give me a reason -nay, an *excuse*\- I will put you down like the dogs I know you to be."

Staring hatefully into her dark brown eyes for a long time, the Aspect of the *Salii* suddenly backs away.

"You should be more measured with your words, Quirinus. Passion serves you poorly here."

"Passion is what brought me here. Passion for my people. Passion for our society. Passion for our prosperous future. It takes heart to stand on the front lines. Less so, to slit throats in the dark like some bedtime monster."

Without another word, Mars Ultor skulks out of her tent, surely to inform Gradivus of her words. She looks down at the goblet of wine at her side in thought, but decides against it. From here on, she'd be eating only the fruit off the trees, drinking only the water from the rivers. Harder to poison.

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

"Light! Blessed light!"

Far off in the distance, the mouth of a tunnel. No momentary glimpse, no cruel tease. Beyond was the far side. Beyond was the Empire.

"Heh! Would ye looka that?! How ye talked abou' it, I'd figure we'd be stuck down here 'till we starved!"

As they rushed to meet the sun's kind embrace, they both felt something odd. A chill breeze, cutting through the sweltering heat of the caves, and a sound like distant thunder.

And then Garth slipped and fell flat on his face.

"Oh my! Ser Brickender!"

"It's wet! Bloody wet glass! Goddammit, my nose!"

"...*Wet?"*

Reaching down, she removed one gauntlet and touched the bare skin to the obsidian floor. It was absolutely soaked, standing pools of water forming in the dips and depression of the tunnel. As she approached the exit from the underground, close enough to see more than the farway glare of sunlight, it soon became apparent why.

A waterfall. The tunnel exited out behind a waterfall. She couldn't see anything past the rushing water, including how far below the water's destination lay, or how deep said destination was already submerged.

"Of course! Of course it had to be a bloody waterfall! Fuck it, lets jump!"

"Are you crazy?! We don't know how far it goes down! Besides, we can't swim in this armor!"

"Well, what are we gonna do, huh, girlie? Go back down into that hellhole and pray we're somehow lucky enough t'find another way out?!"

"Let me think! For now, let's just be glad we have light to see by, yes?"

With a grumble, Garth concedes the point. After all, not even he was in a rush to jump down a waterfall.

Investigating, she looks to the side of the tunnel's mouth, seeing if there was a ledge or a lip to stand on. Alas, all she could see was an utterly vertical cliff face, bare, save for a small, sturdy little tree growing defiantly from the mountainside.

This gave her an idea. A poor one, but here they are.

"Garth? I'm going to take off my armor."

"Wot?! Yer a lady!"

"I've still got my gambeson on under it, you halfwit!"

"Yeesh, yer soundin' more like Lizzie each day!"

"Just listen to me, alright? There's a branch I could climb on, without all that weight, get a lay of the land. But I need your help."

"What for?"

Turning back to him, she begins unbuckling the straps and ties holding her cuirass on.

"I need you to keep me from falling while I reach across."

A minute or two later, the last of her half-plate had been discarded, and, one hand held firmly in Brickender's grip, she begins to reach across with the other, leaning over the divide for the sturdy little plant she had set eyes on.

Edging ever closer, until the very tips of her feet wavered on the uttermost edge of the cave mouth, her fingertips brushing the rough bark.

"Give me more, Garth, I've almost got it!"

"Alright, alri-"

Suddenly, a shout of surprise issued from the Conqueror bearing her weight for her, and in the work of a single moment, it was the other way around. Keeling over, she wraps one hand around the branch in the instant before gravity would have swept her off the mountainside, and the other hand goes from being held to very firmly holding the hands of her compatriot, who was now, courtesy of a troublesome patch of wet obsidian, dangling off the cliff alongside her, in a full set of very heavy chainmail.

"GARTH!"

**"SHITE!"**

*"Just hold on!"*

"*I can't! This armor's... too bloody-"*

***CRACK.***

With a calamitous snap, the trunk of the cliffside shrub snapped, sending Warden and Conqueror both into freefall.

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

*"Lord in heaven... Sir Brickender, are you alright...?"*

"GODDAMIT! Fuck this! Fuck all this to hell!"

*"Good... That's good."*

The two of them sheepishly dredged themselves from the shallow river they had dropped about ten feet into.

"...Well, it *COULD* have been a 500-foot drop into a certain, watery grave, and the both of us know it. Better safe than sorry, y-yes...?"

"I'm not the one climbin' back up that wall to get yer armor back, alright?! Dammit all!"

"Come on! Ser Brickender!"

As the Conqueror angrily storms off down the riverbank, Anna mewls plaintively for forgiveness.

*"I'm sorry! GARRRRRTH!"*

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

Aquilus. His home. Not where the flesh was born, to be sure, but his title? His name? His very reason for living? It all started here. This is where he was named aspect of Mars, given the *persona* of Gradivus, given the sacred duty of leading the centurions, the most righteous and pure-hearted of all the Empire's soldiers, into battle.

His people have grown weak. The Emperor sits, stagnant like a filthy pond, content to play king over this tiny patch of earth. He would bring glory to his people once again, as Mars wills it. He would bring war to the world, make his people strong, as the young Lupa had always wanted.

Ultor approaches.

"My lord. The barbarian has been moved to your quarters. Chained. The elixir has proven effective. She sleeps, even now. Should I wake her?"

The Lupa. From mysterious origins she came, and without answers she left. When she arrived here, chains on her wrists, a great blade at her hip, and ice in her eyes, he realized that this world was so much bigger than he believed. That the Empire was not yet without glory to be won. And now, this woman came from beyond Olympus, speaking of exile and schisms. Of a past that had long been forgotten to his people. She wore a blade in the same style. Did they hail from the same land? Did the Lupa get her dream?

So many questions. And now, answers.

"Yes, Ultor."

~~------------------------------------------------------~~

**Hello! Thank you for taking the time to give my creation a read! I've put in this afterword to ask a question. As you might have noticed, the army of the Empire isn't just limited to the Ceastus and Gladii wielding Centurions. I've decided to make some fan classes for this story, to make the Empire seem more like an independent faction, and spice up the action scenes for the later parts. I've seen plenty of fan character concepts on here, like**  [**u/Blarpwhale**](https://old.reddit.com/user/blarpwhale)**'s amazing** [triple](https://old.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8peiod/a_fully_articulated_and_indepth_hero_concept_the/) [heavy](https://old.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8s6ijy/a_new_hero_concept_for_the_weebs_the_kongo/) [hero](https://f1.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8tbdkb/a_fully_articulated_viking_hero_concept_the/) **concepts, and I'm interested to see if any of you would like to see the Praetorian and Salii given some relatively in-depth moveset-ifying in the near future. I'm looking forward to your input, and as always, I hope you enjoyed!**

[M4F] She's a ranger, a woodslass, more lady than whore - but lewdness, sheer LEWDNESS, is what elves are for! The oak table grinds against your chest, the smooth wood worn from countless travelers pressing up against you as my hips bear down on you from above, callused hands seizing your waist and the solid, swollen *shove* of a warm human cock bearing down *deep* into your ass. It all smells of sweat and ale and rich, spiced mead, your ears tingling with heat as I grunt with pleasure above you.

With a *thump*, my hips meet yours again, and the ale-streaked table jolts back underneath you again, your toes brushing the floor as the crowd raises a raucous cheer.

"C'mon, lad!" a study old dwarf in the corner crows out to me, flashing me a grin and thumping me, hard, on the beat-up iron of my plate. "Ye can go *harder* than that; tha's what elves are *made* for, by the mountain!"

And *harder* I go, a hand wrapping around your throat and the world lifting up around you, your back to my chest as lube and our own juices make your thighs glisten in the candlelight, the alehouse crowd cheering and pounding tables in time to the heavy smack of my sack against your cunt on every thrust.

*Gods*, it's warm, and thick, and buried right up inside you up to your woods-damned *ribs*, it feels like, the grind of the hair at my base seeming to tease you into a sensitive mess. I'm grinning down at you, though, brown eyes warm as I stroke a hand through your hair, an arm wrapping about your waist to keep you properly *speared.*

"Twenny coppers if she can't stand after!" the barmaid cries, already undoing her bodice, and the heat only grows on her cheeks. "That's *lewd*, wot elves are for!"

You can only, from the stretched pounding you're receiving, knightly arms around you hauling you up and down like a toy, surmise that I *agree*, the charming gentleman of a few drinks before submerged into the rutting, sinewy heat of my lust. My eyes skate around the tavern, from the halfling lass already following your example, lustily bobbing her head along an orc's member in the corner, to the cheering, fist-pumping passel of farmers' sons eagerly watching your every bounce and jostle on my cock. "Fuck 'er!" the crowd cries, splashing with mead and eyes shining with lust. "Let loose in every hole, be *lewd!*"

Always, always, the refrain - "*That's what elves are for!*"

It only *continues*, warm fire running through your veins, the world blurring into a mess of getting *fucked*, and the scent of mead, and the distant recollection that I'd asked you *quite* nicely to join my adventuring party, as everyone needs a proper *thief,* though the only thing taken away seems to be any sense of shame. Louder and louder the crowd chants, and harder, *harder*, I pump, until you're not sure if the lurid moans are yours or everyone else's, pleasure and pain swirling like old friends on the dance floor. *For! Lewd! Elves!*, the words flashing staccato in your mind, until -

"No."

It's quiet, amid the grunts, my breath warm against your ear. Slowly, tenderly, my arm relaxes, sinking you all the way down to the base of me, and my hand slides warmly down your belly to pluck your dangling hand up. Callused and strong, gentle and practiced, my fingers slide delicately between your slender digits, dwarfing your palm and curling in until our hands are clasped tightly, my pulse thrumming against your own as I give you a gentle squeeze.

And that hand's twin, you can feel as the blush on your cheeks and chest only deepens, is tracing through your silver locks, thumb brushing the tips of your ears, my palm cradling you and patting, soft and slow and promising.

The crowd goes *cold*, silent - the halfling lass freezes mid-suckle, and the dwarves stand with mouths agape; the barmaid has her tits out at last, a hand on the cocks of patrons to the left and right clenching tight in abject horror and producing squeals of surprise that cut the still.

I can see it, now, on everyone's faces: Some lines, after all, are *not* to be crossed, in polite company.

This, I know, is *lewd.*

"This," I smile gently, pressing a kiss to your forehead and rocking my hips gently again, "is what elves are *for.*"

---

Another fantasy frolic, with many a way we can take it! Of course, charming, rough sex, loving shenanigans, and cheery adventures are always on tap.

Never a worry if you're reading this a month from now, even - I'm *always* willing to hear from *anyone,* any time!

HDD Upgrade Failed, HDD Now (Hopefully) Half-Bricked. So here we go. First I have to say it is my fault, I didn’t do enough research or take my time on it. Here goes they story and situation.
&gt;Original Xbox 1.0 is soft modded with UnleashX (2.38?)
&gt;I want to upgrade the HDD to install games to it.
&gt;Buys an unverified (not even lockable) hard drive as an upgrade.
&gt;Trying to do the upgrade thing with CHIMP.
&gt;Unlocks primary Original HDD, not really knowing what it does.
&gt;Knowing the hard drive upgrade didn’t work anyway, I try to boot with original.
&gt;Error code 05.
&gt;Drive unlocked.
&gt;Well, good thing I backed up the EPROM.
&gt;Uses that Xbox took that can unlock, format, and do a ton with hard drive (MHDD?) on a PATA computer.
&gt;Manually inputs EPROM, making sure it was correct (and it was, all 32 characters)
&gt;Cannot lock drive: security mode frozen.
&gt;Wot?
&gt;I forget a bunch of stuff I try, but eventually get it kind of unfrozen.
&gt;Types in EPROM.
&gt;Hard drive half accepts command. It sits there constantly doing nothing, no drive activity, no new commands to even enter, system frozen.
&gt;Shuts off the Original Xbox supplying power to the HDD.
&gt;I can put in commands again.
&gt;Yay!
&gt;Powers drive back up.
&gt;Wants to verify all went well.
&gt;Let’s unlock it then relive, just to be safe.
&gt;Cannot unlock drive: wrong password.
&gt;Nervous_What.jpg
&gt;Try’s to boot Xbox, maybe that’ll work.
&gt;Error code 06: EPROM doesn’t match HDD password.
&gt;Horrifically searches net for answers that I should have already searched for prior to this.
&gt;Boot into atawpd.exe.
&gt;Unlock with master password.
&gt;WDCWD...
&gt;Hard drive unlock success.
&gt;Noice.
&gt;DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR HARD DRIVE!
&gt;Turns off hard drive.
&gt;Realizes that the instructions said not to.
&gt;Oof, guess I gotta unlock it again.
&gt;atawpd.exe.
&gt;Unlock with master password.
&gt;Master password incorrect: command rejected by drive.
&gt;Insert JonTron reaction here.
&gt;3 months later, I’m here.
So basically, I really REALLY *REALLY* screwed up bad. So bad that, in fact, the drive WON’T EVEN ACCEPT WDCWD... as the master password to unlock. Is there ANY way around this? Can I use the jumpers somehow to override? Is the drive permanently locked and it’s a paper weight now? If anyone needs more details I will tell you them. Thank you so much in advance, I have not seen this anywhere online for anything, so any answer is good.

Recommended procedure for maintaining a Mercury 50hp 500 (1980?) parked in a marine slip? Hi all,

I'm totally new and bought a boat out of passion.  We moved to an island off the coast of Sweden and pretty much everyone has a boat here.  Wanted to fit in, so I grabbed a cheap-o-boat (5m ??? boat) with a 50hk mercury 500.  It has a blue band, so I think it's roughly a 1980 but I'm not really a gear-head and don't know much about maintaining it in day to day use.   We're obviously in salt-water here and I've heard that you're supposed to flush the motor after every use.  However, ours is parked in a slip (which does have a hose) but I can't figure out how to flush it reasonably easily.  I do have the ears and access to a hose - but is it supposed to be submerged in water while it's flushed?  Imagine I should not run it while it is raised out of the water.

Other than that, all I do is tilt the motor up out of the water and disconnect the fuel line.  Is there anything else I need to do?  I've read that you're supposed to run some motors dry after disconnecting the fuel line - but not others...not sure what type mine is.  I've also read that you should use fuel stabilizer every run - not sure what type to get in Sweden (new to this country which makes it a little difficult).

The motor has no hooked up tachometer either and I'm only making 10kts at WOT (which seems pitifully slow).  The forward throttle has a lot of play before it kicks out of idle, so I'm wondering if the line needs tightening. The propeller is also pretty dinged up...so that's not helping anything. But before I mess with anything too much I'm thinking I should install a tachometer.  Is there a cheap tach I could get for this boat?

I'd post pictures, but this boat is pretty embarrassing.

Best,

Rob

Why is Mum being nice all of a sudden?! Hi, all. Sorry to post yet again - I was intending to give you all a break from the sound of my voice but there has been a weird development I can't make sense of! Since Mum came back from her break, apart from her grumpiness on Sunday, she has been quite nice and thoughtful.  (I don't mean that she's suddenly turned into Wondermum, and I still wouldn't attempt to talk about "feelings" with her, though!) She came over yesterday to help me with my duvet &amp; asked more than once if there was anything else they could do. I said I was fine, and was going to the shop today (which I did). she said to let her know if there was anything I couldn't cope with.  I haven't had to do that, thankfully!

And today, on the phone, she was asking about my medication - what I was on &amp; if I was managing it OK! Yer wot, Mum? She's never asked that before, and I'm managing it just fine! Why suddenly ask it now?

My bus pass arrived today, and Mum is thrilled - she's asked about that bus pass several times now which I thought was strange.

She &amp; step-dad are also taking me to my retreat tomorrow, where I shall be mercifully Internet and phone signal free for a few days. I was just wondering what on Earth was going on, though! Is she feeling a bit guilty? Is it just that she happens to be in a reasonable mood? It feels... weird, if I'm honest, but maybe I'm being needlessly paranoid. She'll probably switch soon though... guess I'll just have to take it as it comes!

One-Shot Battle Royale within a Campaign. &gt;be me

&gt;massive fighter with 20 strength

&gt;only non-caster in the group

&gt;DM decides we need to have a Battle Royale

&gt;don't argue, i really want to beat the shit out of some people

&gt;i start next to our cleric, which has the inflict wounds spell, which would kill me almost instantly

&gt;i go first, i swing twice, do 23 damage to him, hes hurting bad

&gt;he goes next, vampiric touch on me, only 6 health from me

&gt;i swing, roll a nat 1 and toss my +1 longsword into the water

&gt;fuckeverything.jpg

&gt;he goes next, heals and forces me to drop weapons, i pick them up next round.

&gt;on the other side of the ship (we fought on a ship), another PC just turned into a giant octopus and went underneath the ship

&gt;once again, i'm up, I swing with my axe. I succeed dealing a bit of damage, I swing with my other hand, and miss. I do action surge and go again, I swing and with a nat 1, swing it directly into the ocean.

&gt;imsorrylittleone.gif

&gt;he goes again, and somehow disarms me again (I forgot how, but I know he did) and I drop my axe and shield. He kicks my last axe into the water

&gt;DM can i use my shield as an improvised weapon

&gt;sure Anon

&gt;i pick up my shield and attempt to bash him, fail both

&gt;whyarerollssoshit.png

&gt;this isn't even my true bullshit yet

&gt;his turn, he tries to push me off, failing massively and he moves to the center of the ship, sure

&gt;wot

&gt;i move to where he is, shield bashing my way through, miss both

&gt;why.jpg

&gt;he tries to move away, granting me an opportunity attack

&gt;OHYESBOY.GIF

&gt;i use my shield and hit him, NAT 20

&gt;thankyougods

&gt;he goes down, and drops his mace

&gt;he fails death save

&gt;i go over and bash his head in with his own mace, killing him instantly

****

****

&gt;now this is where it gets fun

&gt;giant octopus from earlier attempts to attack me, misses both times

&gt;hurrah!

&gt;i convince the pc/character from an old roleplay thing to not attack me

&gt;i try to cross the ship into the other wrecked half, finally see the situation over there

&gt;8 giant fucking lizards, and nobody to be seen

&gt;okay?

&gt;i do a second wind on myself, expending literally everything I have at this point, bad mistake on my part

&gt;giant octopus swipes the deck, looking for his opponent (rogue with invis potion, bad combo)

&gt;me, being a good little boy, puts a crossbow bolt into the giant octopus

&gt;it turns its attention on me

&gt;haditcoming.gif

&gt;attacks me with tentacles, misses

&gt;attacks me again

&gt;grabs me and I'm now grappled by a bloody tentacle

&gt;i didn't remember playing a hentai game

&gt;our rogue valiantly looses a shot at the octopus, trying to break its concentration on the giant lizards and its hold on me

&gt;he hits, but neither goal is achieved

&gt;guess this is the end, prays to tempus

&gt;dragged underwater 50 feet

&gt;okay i'll try to get out

&gt;i get out, and hit it with disadvantage

&gt;it hits, and it breaks concentration on the lizards above, saving my friend/enemy from certain death

&gt;last stand by sabaton is playing, i fully expect to die here

&gt;but wait

&gt;the giant octopus pisses itself, inks the entire area

&gt;alright sure, they dash away, not to be seen for a bit

&gt;i roll a d6 to figure out which direction i go, moving 10 feet out

&gt;i didn't go down, i went to the right, yay!

&gt;i try to swim up for the next few turns, until i reached a chain

&gt;guess i'll die when i go up here then

&gt;goes up, our somewhat friendly rogue is holding onto the chain, with an oil lamp in hand

&gt;atleastimnotdeadyet

&gt;i get up, he explains to me that he wants to set the sea on fire

&gt;okay, but i have other plans

&gt;somehow not losing my mace, i bash his head in with it

&gt;he goes down, 2 death saves from my extra attack

&gt;youcangetup!.jpg

&gt;nope.jpg

&gt;bash head in again, and see giant octopus land on deck, and morph into our local druid

&gt;i try to hit it with my crossbow

&gt;miss, it goes wide, and picks up friends body and uses as half cover

&gt;okaysowhatcanshedofromthisdistance

&gt;WANDOFMAGICMISSILES

&gt;ohfuck

&gt;all seven charges come blasting towards me, i am surely dead

&gt;hits, i'm at 6 hp

&gt;group goes fucking insane "HOW MUCH HEALTH DOES SHE HAVE?"

&gt;ihavenotyetbeguntofight!

&gt;our mighty god and DM pulls ship together, with a gap in the middle

&gt;i run over to the child (shes 17 in game) and make my athletics check and jump the gap

&gt;easy.jpg

&gt;i swing, twice. missing both times

&gt;and this is where i truly fucked up

&gt;she thunderwaves me at point blank range

&gt;i succeed saving throw by a hair

&gt;i have one HP left

&gt;"ANON YOU JUST TOOK A THUNDERWAVE TO THE FACE"

&gt;our druid, runs to the back of the ship and jumps off

&gt;not before opportunity attack time

&gt;i swing, miss

&gt;and this is the end

&gt;then the 189 in the service of heaven!

&gt;she jumps, but the ship begins to sink

&gt;i let myself go down, allowing her to pop up for an attack so i can finally end this

&gt;thishasbeengoingonfor4hoursnow

&gt;few turns later, i see her 5 feet under the surface, and i use my action to dash towards her, i'm right on top of her

&gt;she tries to move, opportunity attacks galore

&gt;she finally moves, allowing me to deliver the final blow

&gt;i swing, i roll a 24!

&gt;then, as i was about to give a massive warcry, i hear the faithful words

&gt;"anon,you have to roll disadvantage in water"

&gt;my heart sinks 90 feet, just where the ship is

&gt;i roll

&gt;i roll a 13

&gt;im at one health, and i just missed by one

&gt;accept my fate, my saltiness could fill 10 happymeals to the brim right now

&gt;she comes up, and thunderwaves me

&gt;there is absolutely no way for me to live here

&gt;my massive fighter of 20 strength, is thrown back in the water, unconcious

&gt;please nat 20, you are my only hope

&gt;i roll

&gt;6

&gt;"mark a death save anon"

&gt;i'm proud and sad at the same time, i've fought through hell and back

&gt;i mark it

&gt;our druid comes over, and with her scimitar, she swims over to me, bashing my head in with the pommel

&gt;our DM announces "Balisa perishes in your arms, Circe"

&gt;all of it was a dream within our campaign, which our characters do not remember

&gt;but we remember, and we are proud.

Roush Axle Backs w/ Mishimoto H-Pipe Daily Driven? Hey, I already have the Roush Axle Backs on my ‘17GT, but I want just slightly more sound out of them.

I was wondering if anyone has paired this axle back w/ a Mishimoto H-pipe?? If so, how loud is it under 3.5k RPMs around the city/hwy during the day &amp; night??

I understand the cold starts &amp; WOT will be slightly loud, but thats too be expected. I’m just looking to sound mean/aggressive while being tame enough to commute/daily drive at low RPMs.

How's your week going? How is your week going so far?

I've met some of the goals I set so far. Did my laundry; stayed on top of rhe dishes (SO did a lot of them 😜); remained in the window of tolerance; had veggies every day, though not two cups and one day I counted salsa as a veggie (I ate a lot of it!).

I'm trying to focus on the postiive, not like toxic Pollyanna shit, but legitimate stuff. It helps me. Ans also my high levels of negativity are affecting my SO.

So this week was work on staying in the Window Of Tolerance. Thankfully my neighbor was quieter than usual because I was trapped indoors for several days due to the heatwave and poor air quality outside.

I managed to stay in the window 4 days straight. My goals kinda cobtributed, I ate veggies every day, I got outside every day walking and sitting in a park (early in am or night when it was cooler and air quality better). I managed to remind myself that the footsteps and vibrations weren't someone going to attack me, and when it still reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore I stayed calm, and grabbed my stuff and went somewhere for bit. I allowed myself to sit and do nothing but TV all day and enjoyed binge watching a show.

Told my inner critic to hush, I'm not procrastinating or being lazy, this is literally to relax and be in the WoT. And also I'm really lacking in social interaction, watching TV helped, actually. I wasn't being a lump on the bed totally cut off, the show was bilingual and it was about other cultures interacting and I saw parts of another world instead of being stuck in my head all day. Closest I could get to getting away from a mental rut and dated, isolated views of the world. Even pop culture from elsewhere helps.

I got 20 pages into a book my therapist gave me before giving up and we talked about it and I am to bring the book to the next appt and see about what thoughts and sensations I'm having that might be interfering with concentration (anxiety,inner critic, flashbacks, etc) so I can calm myself and focus.

I haven't met my veggie quota for the day, yet, so I will have to find something.

I'm kinda frustrated that I'm bogged down trying to manage myself and stay stable instead of 'getting shit done'. I'm fighting back thoughts like 'if I were a normal person', or 'normal people would think...' and I feel bad about it. Not really sure how to dispell that so I can focus and do what I *can* do.

How bout you?

2015 Yamaha R3 no longer running      Earlier this week my motorcycle had trouble starting when it did turn it would idle at 1000 rpm or lower in neutral, very harsh sounding like a lawn mower would be and inconsistent. When I put it in gear it would stall out with the clutch in, but i needed to get home so i drove twisting the throttle to keep it from dying at stops which it did several times. the low idle and harshness was becoming a frequent issue in the past month, letting it warm up would alleviate those issues but it never stalled on me like it had recently.
     On the way home i noticed a significant loss of power, taking the freeway i had to maintain WOT in 5th and 6th to stay at 65+ speeds. I tried turning it on a little after making it home but it no longer idles and dies when releasing the throttle in Neutral  and in gear.
Im at a loss and i would appreciate any help

things ive done recently within the last 30 days
*Replace Air filter (K&amp;N washable air filter)
*Replace Spark plugs (NGK CR8EIX gapped correctly)
*Oil Change (I had been driving overfilled by at least 1/3 of liter for about 3 weeks)

Other things ive done to the bike are a full exhaust swap

Lost compression on one cylinder - what could happen? Hi guys

I‘ve recently rebuilt my engine in a Fiesta ST (@350HP) due to a money shift.

Unfortunately I can‘t afford an all new long block so I had to repair the damage step by step.

Now I‘m done but the problem is; one cylinder is slightly ovaled (not visible, rebuild shop said it‘s well in tolerance, with a little lost compression) and the car now runs great, prolly a little bit less power I‘m guessing 300-320 HP.

When I go WOT, the car will spit out black smoke, you can‘t see it in the rear mirror because it‘s not a big cloud or something, just people watching me go WOT and in wheelspin bouncing off the rev limiter tell me there‘s black smoke coming out my tail pipe. I reckon this is because compression is lost due to cylinder ovaling but the real question is HOW dangerous is this and what could happen if I still go on driving like I do? Normal driving most of times with some daily spirited driving for short times.

Sorry for the bad format/way of writing but I‘m really busy atm and just wanted to get this question off my heart in hope for some mechanical answers.

Many thanks!!!

i hate body positivity movement tbh like, dont get me wrong. i believe that fat ppl have all the right to post their pics online and consider themselves beautiful. i got no problem with that.

what i hate is the fact that body positivity is only for fat people...

i have sh scars and in a bodypos thread i posted a pic of my scarred legs. i got called out that i promote self harm. like wot??¿¿ those were scars, more than a year old scars.
scars are a permanent thing. i cant just get rid of them. cant i love my body when i have scars? bc selfharm is unhealthy?
obesity is also unhealthy. very unhealthy, actually. but its ok when obese ppl post their pics. nothing wrong with that. the most hypocritical thing is that u can change your weight. scars are not changeable.
why is it ok to promote obesity and promoting love to your body regardless of any deformities it has is not ok?

body positivity should also include ppl who have deformities, scars, any "imperfections". we cant change them. why cant we love our bodies the way they are?

What did you accomplish this week? For those of you who set goals

https://old.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/8vc20s/what_are_your_goals_for_next_week/

So far I
* did laundry

* ate veggies a few days, met my 2 cup quota twice

* did dishes one day and SO caught me up once this week

The big one was that I stayed in the WoT 6 out of 7 days, only lost my temper once. It was a lot of work and I am really fatigued and feel pretty weak and have had some issues that scare me into thinking I possibly have heart problems, I had some chest pain too and once a shooting pain in my shoulder for a sec, spoke to a doc about fatigue and he was like all your bloodwork 6 months ago was great, it has to be your brain, see a psychiatrist, maybe a neurologist. No energy for anything else. It was hot and poor air quality kept me at home all day, neighbor was away a few days so that helped a lot. One day I got out, one day I blasted smooth jazz at one end of the apt and my TV at the other to drown his TV and stomping around out. It helped stop the panic and flashbacks that day. And I sat in a different area of the apt so he wasn't directly over me and the vibration was weaker in my body. He wasn't around to throw a party last night and hopefully not tonight either.

The fatigue is really bad and getting worse. I have a sleep study next month, maybe they'll find sonething.

Planet Brocoaster Summercomp - My thoughts for each matchup and predictions for the future Moin guys! For everyone not on Bro Nation this might seem a bit random, but please stay, if you like a well executed and thought out Planet Coaster Competition.
To Explain to you what Bro Nation is, and whats happening there read this:

Bro Nation is one of the best, maybe THE best Planet Coaster Discord Server out there. Especially if realism in themeparks is your jam. We are a very lively community that helps each other out all the time, with tips, tricks, and critique, so we can improve our builds and skills all the time.
Right now there is the Summer Brodown going on. A Competition started by Masked Bandit and N7 aka Mike Sheets, in wich 16 contestants qualified through a qualifier for the actual tournament. They had to build a small parkplaza scene, according to an audiofile, wich they got from the Bros over at BN (Bro Nation).

If you wanna join BroNation, here is a link! See you there!

https://discord.gg/bUMvwE

So now everyone should somewhat know what is going on, so i can begin to talk about the entries, the matchups, what i liked and what i disliked.
A quick note for you all: I will be harsh, and talk about my opinion very freely. I still love you all, dear BN people, so if your entry didnt get that much praise by me, dont be sad, or think i dont like you. Thats definetly not the case :)
Also i am no native speaker, so if you feel the urge to correct my mistakes, you can do that, but please be nice about it.
_______________
Matchup 1 - Redline682 vs Mr. Domez

This Matchup was really interesting for me. The first placed of the qualifier, Redline, going against the last seat, Mr. Domez. One could think its somewhat David vs Goliath. A theme we will observe a bit closer later on.
Redlines entry fit the music very well, and he put a lot of detail work in. He obviously knew the origin material of his music file, since he got the skyrim game musik (i think its partly whiterun) and built according to that feel. The medieval vibes you get from his build are very well woven into the whole scene. The water that you can hear splashing around is present, and the singing birds give you a very nice feeling of being out in the nature. I thought this entry was spot on while first watching it, and expecially the small lake with its wooden contraption around it really caught my eye. The only thing that somewhat disappointed me was the attraction of the area. It just felt wrong, not fitting, and was only there for the sake of keeping the terms of the competition. I think Redline would have done better with any other attraction that is not that anti medieval, like this plane ride is. But its only a small detail for me.
And then came Mr. Domez entry.
At first i was a little underwhelmed because of the lack of detail work we had in his build. It was a lot simpler, and there was NOTHING that caught the feel of the music i got while heraing the audifile. But then i realized:"Wait. He isnt using any music out of his promt, but the construction sounds in the Backround." And that was a genius move. With this move, to dive into this somewhat hidden, and secondary sound in his audiofile he did something unique wich no one in this whole comp did. And this needs to be honored. He even built in a small detail, about a basketball team that was the first one to upset the #16 vs #1 matchup. A nice little hint to the possible David vs. Goliath Situation we have going on here.
In the end i still think that RedLines Build is a lot stronger, and captured more of the athmosphere from the audifile than Mr.Domez did. But he still is the only one to use his Audiofile in such a creative way that he is already the Winner of Hearts in my eyes.

_______________

Second Matchup - Remnant vs. Meatball

Holy shit, this was a hard one.
Remnant, somewhat like the unspoken King of Bronation vs. Meatball, a member of Bro Nation that i rarely so on BN. This might be just me missing his stuff all the time, but i was still surprised how redicoulsy close this one was.
First of all, they both didnt go the Skyrim route, but built totally different things. And i have to say again, this is so clos, i cant even really decide who makes the match, but in the end i still will tell you who my favorite is.
Remnant built this Asian town area, something i can definetly hear in the audiprompt, but it still needs some creativity to get to that interpretation. He had this calm, and relaxin athmosphere going on, wich just went sooooo well with the audio and expecially the music. But what really got me was his attraction: The Stingrayencounter. He used the watersounds in the prompt as his attraction, and in such a creative way, wich is just stunning. The Stingray encounter supports this calm, and quiet athmosphere of the asian town so well, its crazy. I will come back to this later.
Meatballs entry in a whole was, in my eyes, a little bit stronger in that sense, that the music had quite a sad undertone with it, that Meatball used, to creat this postapocalyptic, overgrown feel. Wich he pullled of really well, and his whole area synergized with his audio, and expecially the music, without going anywhere near the Skrimroad. His attraction is where this matchup goes over to Remnant in my opinion, because he used this really big Diskswing Flatride, wich somewhat fit the area optically, but didnt synergize with the calm athmosphere the audio produced. But Remnants Stingrays, as i said earlier, caught this feeling very well, wich is why i have to give this matchup to Remnan.
But i would not be surpised if Meatball takes this one.
Both ducking good entries. So hard to decide.

_______________

Third Matchup

Michael/Zergei vs The Magician

This Matchup is a special one. Later i will tell you why.
This audiopromt was this jazzy, downtownish one, and both builder got quite the same idea. Both built thise nice street scene, with the jazz music going on. Both captured the feeling of being in a big citiy, but with one major difference: Michael made us feel like we are in an actual city, while the magician gave us the feeling of a very immersive themeparkversion of a city, wich is wh i see The Magician in favor here. But there's more. The Detailwork of Michael is already stunning, and he heven has woven some BN eastereggs in his build, but the Detailwork of The Magicians' area, the composition of the buildings, the themeparky feeling, and the presentation by day and night just got me. I waatched this thing at least 5 times, jaw dropped to the floor, and still couldnt process what i just saw.

I will tell you so much, that i had a somewhat clear winner for the whole Brodown this summer, but The Magician might just have changed my view on this topic. I am so excited to see what he will do in the rest of the competition IF he wins.

_______________

4th Matchup

UaKins vs Ducttapeforum

Same prompt as the previous one, and surprisingly similar builds.
UaKins build was a little underwhleming to me, since i got the feeling that he tried to impress us with the size of his Buildings. The Detailwork was not bad, as all of the contestants are really talented builders, but it seemed a bit.. lazy to me. I dont wanna seem mean here, but i have to call it that, since the lack of better words. #langaugebarrier.
It might also be a reason, that the entry from Ducttapeforum on the other hand is so damn strong. While UaKins tried to show us the real city, like Michael did, Ducttape captured the feeling of the Themeparkversion of a city perfectly. The detailwork was awesome, and his attraction, a theater wich seemingly hosts Caravan Palace tonight, was unique, very well put together, and just plain awesome. Due to the fact that the details work a lot better here, the overall composition of sound and build is very well done + the perfectly executed Themepark feeling was hit spot on, i have to give this matchup to Ducttapeforum.

_______________

5th Matchup - SilentMember vs. Zurg

This is a matchup i could not predict. Sadly, SilentMember, a colleague of mine in organizing the Community Bropark (applause to him at this place to managing at nearly alone at most times, since matejakezman and i are very buys during rush hours), seems to have missed the point of his audiofile. At least that is the feeling i get while watching his entry. The music gave me the vibe of some futuristic, dytopian area, with a cold and sterile feel, but what Silent gave us was completely off the tracks. The build itself is nice, and very well executed, but would have fit a lot better with the Skyrim track. Even when i tried to disconnect my expectations for the audiprompts, i still couldnt see what Silent apperantly saw in his entry. Zurg on the other Hand hit the nail on the head (can you say that in engrush? lol). His scene gave the impression of a plane, futuristic area in a japanese park. The feeling was VERY themeparky, somewhat boring, wich is good in this case, and synergized very well with the overall feel the prompt gave. So i have to give this matchup strongly over to Zurg, although the actual build and presentation by Silent was awesome. It just didnt hit the target.

_______________

6th Matchup

Homebanner vs Kaytee926

Same futuristic prompt as before, but completely different results. This matchup saddens me a bit, not becasue of missed targets, but because of one of the contestants seems to have had quite some timeissues (stares angrily at mike). Kaytees build was quite interesting, since he went for a arabian palace feeling, wich i acutally could get behind after listening to the prompt a few times. The idea was kinda off, but definetly not wrong, or missing the target. The biggest problem for me here is, that her area feels very unfinished, and the presentation very rushed. So all i can hope for is, that next time, mike will get sane again, and make the competition fair for all contestants, and that she will then be able to finish her awesome ideas, and give us one kick ass entry. Let all the Jaws hit the floor.
Homebanners entry on the other hand got me. At first, when i saw those rockformations i thought :"Oh! He is doing Taron future style. nice." But then i was surprised in a VERY postive way. His area presents this futuristic, dystopian feeling of the audio in such a perfect way, its hard to describe. The very alien feeling all around this plaza is something i could not shake off, and i wanted to explor that place. The same thing goes for his attraction, the "Time Travaler". I actually have no idea what that exactly is, but because of the way he presented his whole area, and how he integrated the attraction into it, made me wanna see what this thing is. Top notch Themepark building!
So this matchup goes to, if you dont already know, Homebanner.

_______________

7th matchup

Nemmie vs Exmagnus

The first matchup for the advantury audio. and two very different executions of it. Nemmi went for this Indiana Jonesy feeling area, wich he executed very well, while Exmagnus went for a asian (nepaleisan?) area, wich isnt any worse than Nemmies execution. So the question who got the better entry is based on the challangepoints they have to include. And here lies the rason, why i think Nemmie wins this one VERY closely. nemmies attraction, the same airplane ride Redline used in his Skyrim build was integratet extremely well into this whole area. Nemmie achieved a feeling that motivates you to explore the whole area with its forests and waterfalls, wich is further supported by this Ride wich gives you a whole new perspective of the whole area. Exmagnus attraction, i assume, is a Temple with a giant Buddha in it. I can see how this would be an attraction, but in this case it feelsto me that the area was built around the Buddha to give it purpose, while Nemmies flying ride has a purpose on its own, and supports the athmosphere of the area even more.
So i give this Matchup to Nemmie.

_______________

8th matchup

Matejakezman vs Mr. E

This is a matchup whre its hard for me to stay objective, since my Bro in Crime for the Ruobro series is involved. But after meditating over my objectivity, and disconnecting from worldly manners, i got my shit together, and looked OBJECTIVLY on what we got here.
We have two very different builds again, wich both are executed quite well. But one is a bit stronger than the other one, and i will tell you why. While Mr. E went for this Big castle scene, to give us this fairytale feeling, something no one tried in the whole Comp thus far, he oversaw some small things. First i think he overdid it with his idea. The castle is big and impressive, but lackss so much detail that it feels off in some parts. My guess would be that it was to big to finish in a proper way in time, wich is why it gives the feeling of unfinished, and plain facades. Secondly the whole area he shows us is abcent of water. Something ALL audiopromts inculde, and (i think) every other entry executed was missing here. And i think some form of fountain would have fit this area very well. Matejakezman on the other hand, had this very small, and mundan feeling adventure area. But this actually was the perfect call. He overdid nothing, could put in the right amount of detailwork, and he built in the waterfeature in such a unique way, that this point definetly goes to him. All the buildings, all the foliage, and even the pathwork with the waterinteraction were just spot on. The only underwhelming part of mates build was his attraction. It exists, and the ride does fit the area quite well, but its very undetailed und somewhat unfinished in itself, wich might have given him some trouble if he would have been in other matchups.
But in the end, matchup 8 goes over to him quite clearly for me.


Now with all matchups done, i hope you liked reading all of this WOT. If you did, let me know, so i might do more of those posts in the future. Maybe not on reddit but on a better plattform for this.
Thanks guys if you got to this part!
Last but not least i wish all the luck to all contestants that are goin on to the next round. If i predicted them right or wrong dosent matter! Good look yall :)

I wot m8 I was at school and two kids in my line got in a fight. I was irritated of seeing people fight and nobody getting in trouble so I stood up. I walked in the middle and separated them. I stood in the middle like Chris Pratt with the raptors in Jurassic World. A teacher walked up and yelled at me for  “fighting innocent bystanders” she treated me like I was four and told me to go to the back of the line. Not really trouble but very irritating.

Shaky boost in 6th Hey y'all;

Got a weird one- coming home on friday it was 109F and I had to accelerate hard in 6th to avoid someone who really, really wanted to be where I was. Noticed some weird fluttery-ness/shakiness in the boost at WOT after the turbo spooled. Tried it again later on a cooler day (80f) and it's definitely shaking pretty bad. Boost gauge (mechanical) is reporting a flutter between 20-25 PSI. I'm not exactly holding it there because I don't want to damage the turbo or anything.


Any thoughts on what could be causing this? Could be as simple as a boost gauge problem because I didn't feel any weirdness.

How my wife &amp; I turned Fallout 4 into the best co-op game we’ve ever played The question “What would it be like to play Fallout with other humans?” has probably crossed the mind of every devoted lone wanderer at some point or other. When you experience a truly wonderful moment alone in a game (or in life), it’s only natural to wish you could share it with someone else. A while back my wife &amp; I went to Far Harbor IRL (Bar Harbor) [https://imgur.com/gallery/Xmx1V](https://imgur.com/gallery/Xmx1V) And stomping around on the real life Longfellow Island it was impossible not to be seduced by the idea of playing together somehow in the same game world.

But we also know how far from wonderful game experiences can be when a game not only lets others join you but also gives them permission to harass &amp; murder you over and over. For what it’s worth, I have some hope that Bethesda can find a way to build a mostly grief-free wasteland without lone survivors but this post isn’t about the new game. With the subject of multiplayer Fallout on everyone’s mind, I thought I’d share how my wife &amp; I have been having a blast in the Commonwealth for months and months in our first \*co-op\* playthrough and you can do it too, if you have the right ingredients.

**Ingredient 1: Bethesda’s Pip-Boy mobile app**

Technically what we’re doing is sharing a single character’s playthrough but describing the insane adventure we’ve been having together like that seems like...I don’t know….like saying the statue of David is just a hunk of marble. Literally true but misses some important stuff. First of all, we’re not taking turns. We play simultaneously &amp; experience every new discovery &amp; event together. This is possible because we have a real world pip boy. Many of you know that when Fallout 4 came out, Bethesda created a mobile “pip boy” app, mostly as a fun compliment to a plastic, wearable pip-boy toy included with the deluxe version. In other words...the app was marketing. GOOD marketing, but still meant more to help sell Fallout than to be a real gameplay enhancer.  But the thing is... it was fully functional.  And as of this post, it still is. It connects to (in our case) the Xbox &amp; you can still use this app on your phone or tablet instead of pulling up the in-game pip-boy. It’s great and looks wonderful on my huge ipad pro.

**Ingredient 2: A partner with a complimentary playstyle.**

My wife &amp; I love the game equally but we each love different aspects most. She loves the exploring, the scavenging, controlling all the various narratives &amp; relationships, and the combat (especially when it involves a big flaming knife). She’s also really good at making a mountain of caps &amp; likes doing that too. But while we share a love for survival mode, she finds it tough to handle all the resource management that comes with that. Having to stop in the middle of a fight to jab some stims &amp; chug some water breaks her flow when she’s busy handing some raiders their asses. She’s also never really been drawn to managing settlements. But me? I love all that stuff.

**Ingredient 3: A Clear Division of Labor**

When we first started I think we both thought it was just a lark. I’d just started my first survival mode playthrough and she wanted to try it. She kept forgetting to eat so I started force feeding her bloodbug steaks myself via the app and we thought it was funny. And when our pockets bulged &amp; we slowed to a crawl thanks to her hyper-thorough scavenging technique I started chucking out junk without asking &amp; we thought it was funny.  But neither of us thought we’d keep going. I mean, surely if we tried to play the whole game as two partners inhabiting a single character’s body we’d be at each other’s throats before long right? I mean if sharing a single car can make even close friends cranky on road trips, won’t sharing a single suit of power armour be insufferable? The idea was initially even hard for me to get my head around conceptually. I mean this is a role playing game. Who’s role are we playing and how can we both be doing that? I thought about movies like Inner Space, All of Me, &amp; Being John Malkovich. All of them are funny cause the idea of having someone two people in one head is so awful right? But as we got going, each of us handling our own favorite stuff, it felt less like we were Steve Martin &amp; Lily Tomlin &amp; more like we were Goose &amp; Maverick. Or maybe like the pilots in Pacific Rim with each of us equal partners in driving this girl around. In fact that’s how we came to think of it. “Hey wanna drive the girl around tonight?” I’m sure there are many ways it could work but here’s how we just naturally landed on who does what when we play simultaneously with her on the controller &amp; me manning the pip boy on my ipad pro.

**Her Jobs:**

* All the walking/running &amp; ass-kicking.
* Making all the dialog choices, even the morally hard ones.
* All scavenging, bartering, trading, &amp; generally making us super wealthy
* Managing our character’s love life &amp; companion relationships.
* Decisions about what quests to take &amp; which ones to attempt next.

That’s a lot, but so is this game. There’s a lot on my plate too.

**My Jobs:**

* I’m Q. You know, the industrial designer/inventor dude in James Bond who is always crafting up new awesome weapons &amp; gadgets for him. I manage our (now sizable &amp; widely distributed) armory. I do all the weapon &amp; armor upgrading &amp; pick her loadouts from the stuff I made that she likes enough to try out. I won't kit her out with something she doesn't dig but so far I think she's approved everything but rocket powered bats. Won't use those. Even the black one with lightning! OH well.
* I'm the caddy to her Tiger Woods. In the field, I’ll sometimes make weapon swap recommendations &amp; tactical suggestions as I’ve got more general game combat experience than she does and even more opinions. :) But I keep aware that the caddy only recommends. She's the one wot swings the clubs and she swings hard.
* And mostly...All sorts of real-time pip boy help you might file under. “Guy in the chair” stuff. [https://youtu.be/IQfFyls6iA4](https://youtu.be/IQfFyls6iA4) E.g., Navigation. I run the map, keep her apprised of potential nearby threats &amp; quest opportunities, help with wayfinding in the interior “dungeon” areas. Feeding, drinking, managing diseases, rad protection/recovery, stabbing her mid-fight with psychojet or whatever, you get it. I’m also the DJ and make sure we always have the right background whether from a wasteland radio station or Spotify for things like playing the theme to Get Smart every time we go through one of the 20-door doorways in the mechanist’s lair (makes us giggle every time).

But that’s all I do when we play together. The rest of the ‘jobs you gotta do in Fallout” aren’t fun enough to do as a team &amp; only really interest me so I do those solo. For example, “Base Architect.” I love designing &amp; building homes for us in our settlements and thanks to her magical cap-and-material generating talents, we have lots of good bases all over. We’re never too far away from a comfortable place to relax &amp; pretend the world is still normal. More than I even realized actually, this is the first time I looked at them in a list like this.

I was an Architecture major who switched careers &amp; never got to practice it so it’s fun for me to spend way too much time designing our various headquarters. I know many think these fancy pads commit the sin of ‘breaking lore.’ Maybe they’d be right. I do use mods to get access to more types of building materials but only materials that are actually used elsewhere in the game. The story I tell myself is that if a person REALLY cared about his or her house and was a good builder, they might do scavenging runs JUST for shit like panelling &amp; railing. Urban archeology! Also we have access to good clean shit from the institute &amp; pre-war stuff in vaults. Maybe it’s a stretch, but it works for us. I’m also President &amp; CEO of our Commonwealth-wide robot-run component shipping company that keeps all our bases full of concrete, steel &amp; glass for all our leaky skylights. But an important rule we established early on was that I can do whatever I want solo as long as I never go any place we haven't been together. All NEW stuff we expcerience as a team.

So anyway, how’s this crazy two-people-in-one-character playthrough going?

Well we’re finally almost done with the main story quests. Really not sure how many hours we have in it but it's a lot. Looks like a Minuteman ending is a brewin’. We’re level 117 with over 50k caps. That might not impress you all but I’ve got maybe 2000 hours in this game myself from prior solo (normal) playthroughs and I’ve NEVER seen that kind of money or level before this. Between my building and her killing/trading, we were level 40 before we ever even saw Diamond City! This all sounds weird probably but for us it’s working great and is super fun.

You know, now that I think of it, I’m not sure Pacific Rim is the right metaphor for what we're doing because those mech pilots do exactly same things &amp; we augment each other. Our girl is being piloted by two beings like a mutualistic symbiosis. You know, like Venom!

I think we’ll probably be wrapped up and ready to start 76 when it gets here so if you're in West Virginia this Fall and run across an over-designed settlement house with a highly questionable amount of windows it might be us so stop in and say hi.  I think it'll be fun being together again in a new wasteland but this time as separate characters for a change. We will likely be quite rich but please don’t kill us for our caps, just ask &amp; we’ll share! Especially if you bring liquor. Wife makes a mean Dirty Wastelander….just sayin.

Brides with anxiety - what helped you during your bridal shower(s)? Hey everyone! My family and FH's family are throwing me bridal showers early next month (one Saturday and the other Sunday.) I'm flying back from California to the Mid-West, so it's going to be a really, really quick visit. I will be super exhausted, and I've noticed when I do weekend visits to the MidWest I get more stressed than normal.

I'm anxious about both showers for different reasons. My side's shower, because my mom is really intense and will be at level 1000 (she's hosting.) That, and because I'm visiting, it's going to be a super intense GET WEDDING STUFF DONE ordeal. My FH's side - because I only know his mom/grandma/two aunts. There will be a LOT of his extended family that I don't know attending. I'm really shy and also really awkward so idfk what to talk about. I mean, I'm also looking forward to seeing my friends/family, since I don't get to visit that often.

tldr; I haz anxiety, wot 2 do about long-distance showers?

Thermal R&amp;D catback exhaust review I recently installed the Thermal R&amp;D 3" catback exhaust.  I bought it for $633 shipped.

The exhaust was very well made. Quality welds, T309 stainless steel. It didn't include any instructions.

[I made a picture for reference for any future installers](https://i.imgur.com/TPvDukB.png).

Installation was mostly easy, but the pipe that goes over the axle was very difficult. I imagine it is difficult for all systems.  I installed it on jackstands and ramps. I wish I had more room. I also used COBB exhaust hangers.

On a 2018, you will need a T30 torx bit, a 15mm socket, and possibly a 14 and 13mm as well. One of the exhaust clamps was smaller (I think 13mm) for some reason, while the rest of them were 15mm.

I ended up having to cut off the hanger on the pipe, there was no way it would fit over the axle with the hanger.

The exhaust uses all slip joints. For the straight sections, this was no problem. For the pipe that goes over the axle into the rear resonator/muffler, the ends of those pipes were enlarged like a bulb.  The axle pipe slips into the muffler pipe and then a clamp goes over it. For the life of me, I could not get the clamp to go over this part without it leaking there.  I also lost the hardware for the tailpipe, and wasn't able to clamp it on.

I ended up taking the car to an exhaust shop, and they welded the troublesome clamp sections for me.

It is very quiet at idle, only slightly louder than stock.

It's also quiet while cruising, and there is no drone. Under WOT t gets very loud. I'm surprised how it can go from so quiet to so loud.

[The tip matches the rear valance very nicely](https://i.imgur.com/nPXuNxI.jpg)

I would have preferred if they used flanges for their joints. I'm embarrassed to say that I spent nearly 5 hours on this, mostly because I couldn't get the rear clamp to not leak.

I'll try to upload a video later, as there are virtually no videos of this exhaust.

OTS Tune to Limp on CS Turbo I recently blew my K04, haven’t driven the car for about two weeks. I just ordered a Corksport turbo and the 3.5 bar MAP sensor. Should be here tomorrow, but I need to be able to drive the car still, until I am able to get a custom tune.

For the record I will only be running this tune for about a week at most. I just need to get from Point A to Point B, no WOT or high boost or anything.

What I was thinking is downloading the Safe Mode Map from Cobb, and changing the MAP scalars and the MAF voltage tables for my specific intake. To prevent overboost I want to unplug the BCS to force wastegate spring pressure (I think it’s 17 PSI on the CS turbo).

Is there anything else I need to do? Like I said this is just to get my daily back o the road while I wait for the custom tune. Also, anyone know where I get the data needed for the MAP scalars?

SOLVED - 1998 KLR250 Bogging at High RPM A while ago I made a post about an issue I had where my 1998 KLR250 was bogging at higher RPMs and would update it when I found the issue. That was in January and I deleted the post as I figured the bike was as good as scrap as I couldn't figure it out 4 months down the line.

Tonight I figured it out!

So, the issue was, my gf and I were riding out to a state park in Jan, I was on my 650 and she took the 250. About an hour in we stopped and left the bikes idling as we checked out a dam. After getting back on the bikes I motioned for her to lead and she zipped forward before slowing down and giving the tell-tale problem signs of fiddling the with the stop cock and looking down at the engine. We pulled over and she said it had no power at high RPMs. Okay, I figured it was some dirt in the carb as the fuel was running low in the tank and all the particulate matter had likely concentrated toward the bottom.

We limped in to a gas station and fiddled with it, blowing gumout into the fuel line for 30mins to an hour before we were about to give up when suddenly it would rev higher, then backfire. But we still could get it home.

After getting it back I ordered a carb rebuild kit and when it came I cleaned the carb completely and rebuilt it. After installing, the same exact problem occurred. UGH!!! So I added all new fuel lines, checked the petcock, checked the air hose on the tank, and added a new inline fuel filter. Nada.

So, I went forward and checked the valves, as the bike had 15k miles on it I figured maybe that was the issue. The valves were basically in spec but could use a slight adjustment, which I did. Same issue but now the bike would kick over easier than ever... so strange.

So I figured okay, well, maybe it's the main jet. Took apart the carb, totally clean, rebuilt. Same issue. So, I begin testing electrical components starting with the plug. Plug looked like it was running rich, really rich, but I figured that may be due to fucking with the carb. Replaced it, same issues and still rich. Compression was good on the engine still, too.

So I removed the wiring harness and tested it. No shorts. Tested the rectifier, good. Tested the coil, good. Tested the stator, good.

So at this point I crossed nearly everything off my list and said, fuck it, this bike it trashed.

So there it sat in the garage for a couple/few months.

Then one day I was surfing the net and a guy on another forum had mentioned that his jetski wouldn't rev to max without bogging and it was either his stator or his rectifier as he replaced both at the same time but, the key was, they both tested fine.

So obviously, I figured there's no way it could be that easy.

I purchased an all new rectifier and stator and tonight I installed the rectifier first and fired it up. I pulled the handle back to WOT and it screamed all the way through to the top.

THAT WAS IT. THE G-DAMN RECTIFIER. After I danced a jig and finished waking all my neighbors up with the racket, I re-tested the old rectifier and it tested fine, however, one small thing I noticed I never saw before was a bit of corrosion on one of the contacts. Could it be that with that corrosion it had enough contact under low load to operate fine but after a higher load it would fail? I'm guessing so.

But, for all you out there with a similar issue, maybe it is the rectifier that tested fine that's actually the issue.

Cheers!

5.7 vortec engine stumbles and won’t hold 1-1.2k rpms after wot runs. I know this is a shot in the dark but I’m hoping someone may have an answer.
All other rpms work great including idle. 1-1.2k even works great when first launching the boat and cruising around but as soon as I do a wot run and then slow down, it’s like a dead spot at those rpms.
Normally wouldn’t be a problem at any other rpm but that’s the cruising speed for our canals. Any slower and you’re barely moving and any faster and it’s turning up too much wake.

I’ve checked compression, timing, spark plugs for AF ratio and they’re the right color. What else could it be?

Thanks guys

July 14 What accomplishments are you proud of this week? For those of you who set [goals](https://old.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/8wzmst/july_8_what_are_your_goals_for_next_week/)

* I ate more veggies this week, I notice it helps improve my mood and ability to handle things.

* I did my laundry, including washing the dust mite covers, heat treating pillows in.the dryer (kills dust mites)

* was bad about dishes this week, but caught up on monday and today

 * I did some work with parts this week. Discussed book with therapist.

* my chest pressure is still there, but fatigue improved after eating a lot of red meat.

* staying in the WoT was hard this week. Neighbor was home a lot and it was a battle. Spent three days just doing everything I could and hovered at the top part of the window (lost my temper once, lots of angry thoughts and fantasies about my neighbor being run over by a bus and celebrating). People, particularly kids, decided to invade my personal space and not others. Thankfully today nrighbor was out and I caught up on rest and sleep. It dropped me down to a calmer level.

* paid fines, returned stuff to TJ.

Got about 25% of my list done.

My keto Journey from Jan - Jun/July Warning: a WOT written by a cynical man

Okay, so I start keto since January, but I am in and out. Whenever I am in, I stay in for about 4 - 6 weeks before I break the combo for festival celebration.

Chinese New Year on Feb. This break lasts for 1 month(too many cookies to clear up... And I am not one to waste the food.)

My birthday on May. This break lasts for 1 week(I didn't manage to find a keto version, so I can only eat the real version, then I also take this chance to eat some foods that I missed...)

The trip with my family on June. This break lasts for 1 week(the trip is only about 2 days, but I also take this chance to eat back some stuffs that I missed)

Now... No break right now, about 3 weeks. Around after 1 week in, I tried to check my body, and by right, in this state, my urine ketone should be shown "positive", but I got "negative" instead. Of course, it is possible that  my body can utilize ketone efficiently despite all the breaks... Or maybe I am on the wrong track.(as in, my diet might have tiny bit too many carb, meaning I am only on lchf track, not keto track.)

And now...
72kg(actually I measured at the mid of Jan, when I was already halfway of the 1st keto... So I believe that I am heavier) -&gt; 60kg(ranging from 58kg to 61kg)

For someone who is 165cm(male), Asian, it seems alright. Lots of people did ask me to stop slimming anymore, and I only have one thing to say: let me keep at it for a few more months first to stabilize the weight. Losing is not easy, but keeping it is the hardest, and I actually still want to lose... Some fat (not necessarily weight)

But my feeling throughout the journey so far?
Meh... I will say the feeling is neither worse, nor better. And even during those break/cheat periods, I also don't feel any negative effect from eating the carb.

So when people said that they come for weight loss, stay for health, I have my very-cynical doubts.

It is likely me on the wrong track, or I just simply don't feel any amazing effect.

So I also suspected that the slimming effect on me is not caused by keto WOE (fat burning by using ketone)...

One more thing to mention: in the past, I thought that I would like bacon and cheese, so it is also one of the reasons why I jump in this keto ship... After some attempts on cooking bacon, I find out that bacon is just OVERRATED. As of cheese, it is also not very wonderful... Cheese bake is just bitter even when it is not burnt...

That's why when lots of people said as if it is not restrictive, I felt tempted to snark back cynically.

Sorry if this post is way too cynical and negative, but it is my journey so far.

Peugeot 103 with new carb still won't go faster than maybe 30. What next? Got bitten by the moped bug, and got a Pug 103. Lots of fun...but 25 mph? BOO!  WTF is this drinking straw intake/carb?Gurtner BE GONE, and take that rattly air box with you! So...I added a Dellorto 15.15 and Malossi intake and after 3 engine mount/remounts to fix the air leaks on the shitty intake she's running like a champ.

BUT, even with so much more flow through that engine, I'm not going any faster than before. Definitely moves my fat ass a lot easier both at launch (i use that term LIGHTLY) and across the throttle...but top end is exactly the same it seems. Speedo needs work, and I left the phone at home so it was just feel as opposed to actual measured. Wasn't thinking I'd be racing, but expected more.

It's the non-variated 103 LS-U1, so I'm thinking that the clutch/gearing might be whats maxing me out? I don't even need WOT to hit top speed, but once I'm at a certain speed, trying to accelerate gives me some shudder, and it feel like I'm fighting the bike at that point. Trying to be gentle while breaking the new stuff in, but the engine feels like it has power to spare for sure.

I have a couple of theories:

1) No variator. Just cant apply torque well enough to get past 30. Doubtful on this, because it feels like a bad guess. Even if the torque is applied poorly across the throttle, I should be able to "run up" to higher speeds over long flats. I am also topping out feeling like I have more left in the engine. The shudder I get when I apply the last bit of throttle makes me think this guess is super wrong, but I'm including it because I can't help but wish I HAD a variator!

2) The clutch was designed to help limit the power applied. This model has all kinds of power killers to keep it to the rated speed. The carb, the intake, the cylinder, literally everything. Thankfully the carb/intake should be the biggest part of that, but given that I'm getting shudder when trying to go above certain speeds...I'm wondering if there's a limit to how fast it can spin before it disengages again?

3) I am trying to exceed the maximum speed the gearing can take. Again, this feels like a bad guess. I have ridden bikes before, but never really tried going at high speed on low gearing. Just seems like if I'm trying to spin it all too fast it might shudder/slip? That feels like something chain tension should keep from happening, though.

So, be gentle. I'm a reasonably smart guy, but I'm brand new to mopeds and to small engines in general. I got bit by the bug, and I'm absolutely LOVING working on her, but I have a lot to learn...so if I said something INSANELY stupid up there....you know why!

Tomos A35 throttle issue, cutting out at WOT: Just finally managed to install a new carburetor, a 19mm OKO.

I currently have the air filter off completely, I got one of the mesh ones but it didnt give enough clearance for the pedals, so for now I just dont have one. Im planning on stretching some pantyhose or something over it to make a makeshift air filter later.

I went to give it a test run, and found that it was running pretty lean.

I tried switching the main jet out, which cleared up the white exhaust? But now two things are happening:

1) It lurches forward when im not putting any throttle on, sometimes when running it and i dont have any throttle on, the throttle is still on and it keeps going.

2) When I get up to WOT it dies out, i can bring it back by reducing the throttle. (is this a float issue?)

Also, the main jet had "K95" on it, what does the K mean? I was told Polini main jets work, and they do, but the numbering is different, I figured 60-80 would be the range that I was in, am I wrong? Does that K95 mean its actually a 95 jet or is it a manufacturers code or something?

We're suppost to be at the hospital in 1 hour!" I awoke to Stacy's face and let out a mighty ree "REEEEEE GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ROOM STACY" before I fell out of my crib and falling on her. "Anon, you fat fuck get off me!" I let out a big poo in my Toy story diapie before I had Chaddy Daddy lift me up while Stacy limped up and started breathing too loud. "Oh god, everything hurts.." she said with my poo stains on her. "REEEEEE MUMMY CHANGE MY DIAPIE" Mommy walked in my room to see Stacy limping covered in poo. "You're 32 years old! Don't you know how to use the toilet already?! Stacy, are you ok sweetie?" Fucking bitch put Stacy before her precious big boy. Stacy showers my poo off before we head to the big hospital. We were in the waiting room before a group of nurses approach us and take me to a room. I dont like this. I lay in a bed and am forced to breathe this sleepy gas. I dream about my beautiful waifus Fluttershy and Kotori Minami giving me blowey joeys and feeding me tendies on my throne in my very own McDonalds play place. A few hours later I awaken to see my family above me and me in a hospital gown. "How was the surgery?" Wot. Surgery?? I get up with the hospital gown still on me. I can feel the dried shit in my buttcrack from earlier. "Yes you are very morbidly obese and had fat removed from your body because it was unhealthy and dangerous" Did Bitch Mommy really call her precious baby boy unhealthy!?! I let out a mighty ree before waddling out the door in my poo covered hospital gown and demanded I be taken to Wendys for my daily 20 tendie meal. "No! You are very unhealthy and are being put on a diet!" A diet!?! I let out the biggest ree my body could do and aimed my butthole directly at Mummy, Stacy, the doctors and nurses and Chaddy for denying their big boy tendies. Mummy sighed and I could hear her crying "Fine..." Yaaaaay! Mummy, Chaddy and Stacy had cleaned themselves up and I ended up getting 40 tendies and 500 gbps for my surgery and spent the night jerking off onto my Chiaki Nanami figure that night and quickly regaining my 1000 figure.

My Experience With Riots Banning System Hello, my name is Genagoon, Genchi, or Genacoon. Those are all 3 aliases I took on multiple accounts I've played league of legends on since around season 4-5. But to get to the point, riots banning system is one of the most unfair and shitty systems I've ever seen. 2 of the accounts have been permanently banned, Genacoon and Genagoon, and in my opinion it is incredible how they even went through. Let's start with the original ban, Genacoon. This account was banned sometime in September of 2017 (unfortunately I cannot pull the actual date because the ban thing doesn't show it) for the text shown below. As seen in the text, the only things I said that bannable was flaming the Trundle and calling him and the skarner garbage, and complaining ab Silvers being bad. Some context for that scenario, the Skarner ganked me as Jax 7-8 times before 15 minutes, so I was extremely behind, and recommended the Trundle go to another lane and get them ahead since the Skarner was camping top lane. Instead, he comes top to a 2v2 and dies about 3 times if I remember correctly, to which he starts to flame me for being bad, which admittedly I wasn't the best player then, even though I was ganked around 10 times by 20 minutes by Skarner. The Trundle also started flaming the enemy Skarner for being trash and things of the sort, even though he was doing much better. So to that obviously I was aggravated, so I responded to him to mute the Skarner who was taking advantage of the trundle being childish and instigating him more "imma mute him from now, i suggest u do the same". Instead he continues to flame, which is where I go further to flame and other things, "for the living fuck shut the hell up. and hes trash at skarner. so shut up. fucking 3 year olds holy shit" . You may say "well why didn't you mute him?" in reference to the trundle, which is a very good question which I don't have the answer too. I proceed to get flamed by the bot lane who aren't doing any better even though they weren't ganked at all, then nothing else said is really toxic, except "Silvers pathetic".

So yeah, I guess that ban isn't as insane because I was pretty toxic there, but not at all compared to some other things people get away with. But after that ban I was very careful with things said in all chat and in game, because league has a community that can dish it out but can't take it.

So the first temp ban on Genagoon was entirely a misunderstanding error, but even then it makes no sense due to me explaining it to them but they basically just ignore what I said and just typed an automated response.  The reason I was banned, according to the rioter response, was because I said "kys", which I then apologized for in all chat due to it meaning to be for a close friend in a /r message.

\[11:40\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): sol
\[12:40\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): kys
\[12:41\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): slav
\[13:40\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): Gg
\[13:45\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): OH SHIT
\[13:46\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): I SAID
\[13:48\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): KYS IN ALL CHAT
\[13:49\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): MB
\[13:52\] \[All\] Genagoon (Nidalee): LOL

I explained to the rioter that it was a mistake and was supposed to be a /r message, to then he said

"I understand that the penalty is frustrating, but we don't want this content said at all. We do have the context of the situation and we would not remove the penalty from the account.

If you have anything new you would like me to address please let me know.

Skeletor
Riot Games Player Support"

So basically what they're saying is context doesn't matter (which is incredibly unfair, because there are so many scenarios where it DOES matter, a LOT) and that even if you apologize in game it's still bannable. It's even worse knowing that the entire situation could've been avoided if 2 things said were typed in a /r instead, showing how a simple mistake could still lead to a ban because riot doesn't care ab context. But that's just a temp ban, the permanent is MUCH worse trust me.

After this ban, which was June 9th (wow I have not realized it was that recent) I chose my words carefully, and used discord a lot more, where I could flame my friends how ever I wanted because we could take jokes. But then today about 2 hours ago, I played a normal game, because I wanted some practice before going on Genchi and playing ranked, and this account needed to be leveled up instead so I thought lets kill 2 birds with one stone. I call top, then it's taken by an Insta locker Yasuo. I remembered why I don't play blind then asked the Yasuo if I could top, since I assumed that he just didn't see me call "yop", which anyone with basic assumption skills could realize was meant to say "top". Instead of him replying, the Jax replies and calls me some sort of curse or something then tells me to shut up. I just ask the Jax "are you good?" bc I assume he's just having a rough time. No response so I lock in Wukong mid. As the game goes on, I get first blood and another kill on the enemy katarina, so I take the Jaxs second or third red since he's topside anyways and it would help me mid anyways. As a Jax main and Jungle main, I would have no issue with this and I doubt any normal person would either, but instead the Jax proceeds to mia ping me about 5 times then goes to my lane all the way down to the tier 2 turret and suicides. Then after he flames me the entire match. I ask the enemy team to report him and quote him on something he said, seeing as it would give them an actual reason to report other than my word.

Genagoon: easy report
Genagoon: report jax
Genagoon: calling me a nigger autistic fuck then running it down mid ?
Genagoon: i mean idc what lies youre trying the chat logs show more my man
Genagoon: reports do nothing if nothing was said lol
Genagoon: no, you called jng first then told me to stfu after yas took my top
Genagoon: if you continue to flame its easier for you to get banned, I would just stop talking lmao
Genagoon: your choice ofc

Might I add that "if you continue to flame its easier for you to get banned" was SO ironic, I actually chuckled while reading the ban.

So the rest of the game I play on while the Jax just flames and ints, telling the enemy team that I'm toxic even though I said nothing to the jax that could be seen as toxic, and me and the enemy team begin to poke fun at his nonsensical racist comments about french people and blacks. That's really it. I hope people reported him but I have no idea. But after I get the ban notification, I send a ticket to riot immediately and send the text to riots twitter, in hope of a faster response there. As I'm typing this its been about an hour and I still haven't gotten a response.

With my story said and over, I would like to just say, riot fix your fucking game. Yeah the balancing is terrible but that I can cut some slack on seeing as I'm a 16 year old with no experience developing or balancing a game, but I do have some experience with bullying, toxic behavior and how punishments should actually be delivered, and I find it pathetic on how little attention is given to this system yet how sever the punishments are.

Where to buy Pregabalin (Generic Lyrica) online cheap # PREGABALIN CAPSULE

## What is this medicine?

Pregabalin is an anti-epileptic drug, also called an anticonvulsant. It works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures. Lyrica also affects chemicals in the brain that send pain signals across the nervous system. Lyrica is used to control seizures and to treat fibromyalgia. It is also used to treat pain caused by nerve damage in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), herpes zoster (post-herpetic neuralgia, or neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury.

Anons first day at school Be me, Mommys now 32 year old big boy and favorite child INSTEAD OF BITCH STACY. Chaddy had convinced Mommy to take me to this place called 'School' because he thought I was 'mentally disfunctional'. The fuck is he calling disfunctional?! I'm the ultamite intellectual due to my daily hours watching Rick and Morty, I bet that Chad never even heard of it! Whatever, I go back to sleep in my crib hugging my Sena Kashiwazaki waifu pillow after I shot a fresh load of milky pee on it and dream of my own personal planet, Tendie World inhabited by all 396 of my sexy waifus. I wake up after I heard Mommy call my name. "Anon, time to wake up! Its your very first day of school!" I waddle out of my crib and put on my finest Barney shirt and a fresh Toy Story diapie and headed out the door. I stood out there for 3 whole minutes. Was Mommy still upset about the poo poo incident at the hospital?? Soon I seen a small yellow bus by our house and I saw a 60 year old woman in the drivers seat. I squeezed my 1026 pound frame in the bus (I'm still in REEEEcovery :() taking up the entire bus. A couple minutes later we arrive at a brick building. "Sunny side up Elementary school". Sunny side up is Chad food! I ran out the bus while a bunch of little boys and girls followed me. The driver must of been super tired, I dont think I saw her move since half way through the trip. I arrive at my new big boy school and I hear the bell ring. Everyone else was going inside so I waddled along. I saw lots of doors with kids names in the halls. Kayla, Brandon, Amber, David.. Anon? Thats my name! I was greeted by an older looking Stacy while little kids scattered by me and walked in the class. "Good morning class! I'm Mrs. Johnson!" "Good Morning Mrs Johnson!" Mrs Johnson took our names and gave us a piece of paper and crayons for us. I could finally show my beautiful art skills! After a half an hour later, I ran towards the front of the class "Mrs Johnson! I made this for you!" She took the paper "Oh thank you, Anon-" "Its a scene from my favorite hentai, Oni Chichi!" Mrs. Johnsons face turned pink "This isnt very appropriet for school, Anon.." Wot "REEEEEEEEEEE I MADE THAT JUST FOR YOU, MOMMY LOVES MY ARTWORK" Suddenly the bell rang. Snack time! Me and the rest of my grade primary class ran to our class table in the cafeteria. I noticed that Jade was wearing an MLP shirt with my waifu Fluttershy on it so I sat by her "Hi.." she said. "Do you know that Fluttershy is one of my waifus??" "Whats a 'waifu'" I told this young woman of culture all about MLP and I even pulled out my Fluttershy x Rainbow Dash doujinshi out if my 6th chin to show her. "Ewwww!" She said before running away to some 5 year old Chad. I pulled a leftover tendie meal from my 3rd chin and ate it. I'm a recovering big boy after all. By the end of snack I heard my name on the announcements telling me to the office. "Hello Anon" "Hi" "We got a call from your teacher that you were drawing inapropriet things in class and was even screaming" Wot "We called your parents to pick you up" Mommys coming to pick me up?? Yaaaay! 10 minutes later I saw Mommy and Chaddy in the principals room. I was taken home later and spent the night in my room sucking my thumb and jerking my mighty 2 incher to Asian porn before falling asleep. Like usual, I woke up and went to school but wasnt put in my normal classroom. I couldnt find Jade or Mrs. Johnson anywhere. Then it hit me. Bitch put me in Special Ed

2018 WRX how to take off faster? So today I was at a red light next to an Acura MDX or something, there was a merge straight ahead to when the light turned red I floored it. Essentially it felt like there was a huge lag up until 3k RPM, like the feeling you get when the A/C is on except my A/C was off. Also, I got smoked by the MDX. This has happened to me before in a similar situation, where I got passed by a Chevy Bolt or something off the line because I have no pull in first gear.

Am I doing something wrong? I don't go flooring my car off the green light very often, probably like once every 3 months when the situation calls for it, so I'm not too experienced with what I should be expecting. Should I be dumping the clutch at 3k RPM to get a faster start, I don't feel like I should have to do that in order to get ahead of crossovers/econoboxes. Besides, I heard it's bad to go WOT in 1st gear, so if that's true then would the car be even slower if I was driving it properly?

WoT player shoots robber, proceeds to play WoT A 44-year-old World of Tanks player from Novosibirsk, Russia is being brought to trial for killing his robber. The accused believes that the computer game saved his life. It all happened on the night of May 9, 2018.

He was alone in the house, because his wife was visiting relatives that night: "Three o'clock in the morning, I'm playing WoT. Since I had health problems since childhood, I have trouble breathing and a sleep disorder. From the corner of my eye I noticed a silhouette of a man behind the window. He was messing around in my garden. I just finished cleaning it up before the Victory Day celebration, left my pitchfork and a shovel there. I was afraid that he might use these instuments to attack me."

But houseowner wasn't only armed in the virtual world, he is an avid collector in real life too. He has a whole arsenal in his house, so he immediately rushed to the safe, where his guns were stored.

"I have airsoft guns, and pneumatic rifles, and some weapon replicas, there is a Makarov pistol model, for example, - he boasts. - So I picked up a pneumatic gun, the biggest one I had, for intimidation purposes."

With his weapon readied, he opened the door and almost immediately met face to face with the criminal. "I was mortified! He was wearing a medical mask. I pulled the trigger instinctively."

The bullet hit robber's neck. The wounded criminal ran off. What happened next is already reported in the prosecutor's office of the Kirovsky district: "After he was shot, the masked man escaped, and houseowner, after getting back inside, resumed playing World of Tanks. In the morning a corpse of a masked man was found by a passer-by."

Police immediately identified the victim: a well known face in the region, a convicted criminal. Sentenced at least twice for a total of 22 robberies and thefts in the past, he was just released last year and apparently decided to get back into business.

Houseowner admits: when police arrived on May 9th, he told them everything. He was questioned and later released from the police station. Police officers even sympathized with him. It is clear that houseowner had no intention to kill. It was dark, it was raining and he was only trying to protect his property. However, in Russia, killing someone even in self defence is considered a crime, namely "causing death by negligence".

"I had to take loans to afford a lawyer, - he says. - Honestly, after what happened, it feels like it would've been easier to just kill myself. On the other hand, if it weren't for the World of Tanks, who knows what might've happen to me."

According to Russian law, WoT player faces two years of jail time. But provided that earlier he was not tried, he can hope for a suspended sentence instead.

Cool detail about the kirkhammer and LHB I recently watched a video about how impractical a longsword sheathe on the back would be and my mind hopped over to bloodborne. I gave the transformation animation(wot in turrnashun) a closer look and i noticed the hunter kinda clips the longsword through the side of the greatsword/hammer. First i thought the devs overlooked or ignored that little goof, but after adjusting the camera i noticed the weapons actually have a slit on the right side for the longsword to be pulled out through. I have to say, i was amazed at the attention to detail from puts in their games.

6.5 hp briggs won't rev up and dies under load. So a little back story first. Have a wheeled trimmer with 6.5 briggs 4 stroke. not sure on year, probably purchased in mid to late 00's. So started a few weeks ago was cutting everything going great trimmer dies during operation. Would not start back up. After tinkering with, found coil to have open in wire under stress. Replaced coil, And adjusted kill switch (sometimes wasn't opening ground). Now starts every time, and on first start after coil it started was running awesome like a raped ape. Starting to do some cutting, lasted about 2 minutes then bogged down and died. Now will start up but wasn't wanting to rev up. I messed with the governor spring and if I play with the throttle while idling it doesn't seem to respond, with WOT. I left it alone for the night. Any idea of where to go now? I was trying to see if there's a adjustment on the carb or a fuel filter, but neither seem to be present. I will say carburetors are not my forte. Have pics if interested. And will respond to any advice. Now back to google and youtube

A letta from one humie to anuvva, as written by a Gretchin. Foreword: I originally wrote this for my girlfriend who is currently off in boot camp at Fort Jackson. We like Warhammer, (I mostly do IG though, while she's all Necrons.) and have been in correspondence mail-wise ever since she left off. Today I decided to write this all Orky as best as I understood, and hopefully when she receives this letter it'll be a real kicker. I also added the link to the picture that I've sent her alongside the letter. Oh, and the letter might not be the most mature, and I'm uncertain if I should qualify it as NSFW since it contains, I quote, the word "Boob."

Enjoy.

Hi dere. Da boss ain't 'round t' rite you, so'z izz'n gonna do it for 'im. My name iz Iggumz by da way, and iz'z gonna show you a piksha of me in dis letta. Da boss sez I iz pretty good at ritin' so 'e gave me a cupple fings t' rite about t' ya.

Izn't it a humie wif sum swollen muscles on der chest? Wot d'you call'em? Boobz? I iz pretty sure da boss sed sumfin' 'bout you an' doze. Y'know, I fink you otta get dat checked out. Nobody should 'ave muscles dat big on dere chest, not even Ghazguul or da biggest warboss o' da great waaagh.

Sekindly, 'e sez dat da work iz cummin' along reel nicely wif da boyz. Now, fer sum reezin da boyz'z all metal an' scary wif der big stikkas an' all, an' dey ain't green like me or da rest of da boyz. Da boss sed sumfin' about Nek-ronz or whatevva. Dere iz still plenty 'a more fings da boss wanted me t' say, but rite now iz'z too tired. I'll get back t' ya t'morrow on da nine-teenf. G'night, an' let Mork send ya plenty a' dreamz about bein' cunnin'.

Alrite, I iz back fer t'day, an' I iz gonna fix up da rest o' dis 'ere letta. Da boss called me into 'is tent earlier t'day an' told me 'e got free more of ya lettas, all datin' to July ferteenf to da siksteenf, an' den 'e sez t' me ta rite a cupple a' "responzez" to ya. I dunno why youz so importint to da boss, but you musta gave 'im a lotta teef, or else 'e wouldint make me rite ya so much.

So da ferst responze iz dis:

Yeh, 'e'z been finkin' about you lotz. 'e sez dat youz da most importint humie in da hole zoggin' world to 'im, an' dat it don't matta 'ow much dirt 'r mud getz on ya. Youz still alwayz gonna be da prittyest, bestest girl to 'im. An' den 'e sed you waz da only girl. I still don't gettit. Why iz humies wif big chest muscles so much betta den 'umies wiffout any? Whatevva.

Da sekind responze iz dat 'e nevva knew dat dey shot you wif sum kinda hormown supprezzant. Wat da zog iz a hormown, doh? Anyway, 'e sez dat it'z kinda freeky cuz it reminds 'im o' dat book 'e wonse talked about wif ya. Nineteen-eity-sikz iz wot 'e sed.

At dis point, da boss sez t' me dat in case you DONT unn'astand wot iz'z ritin', you shuld speek it t' yerself an' meybe youd unn'astand betta. I dunno why you couldint, doh, cuz I izzn'n da bestest ritin' gretchin dere iz. A lotta boyz pay me lotza teef t' rite fer 'em, Y'know! Anyway, da fird responze iz dat 'e 'opes you get sum good rest afta you do sumfin' called Da Forge, and in case you've already been fru it, 'e sez dat 'opefully it wazzint too bad on ya, an' dat you kicked it'z zoggin' azz all rite an' proppa insteada da uffa way 'round.

Finally, da boss sez to me dat 'e luvz ya agin, an' dat 'e 'opes real bad ta see you agin sumtime soon. 'e 'az me qwote, "Sinzeerly, yer fewtcha feeanze, Brockly Squash Bottum"

A humble request for advice Yar mateys!  I've run into a bit of a snag.  I conduct my torrenting behind a paid vpn on a dedicated machine.  For the first week with charter, I was torrenting as usual, but over this past week, a 1-3 hour torrent is suddenly estimated at days and even weeks.  I thought perhaps it was just the torrent, but it seemed to be everything I tried.  So I did the old internet speed test from google.  On my other computer it reports nearly 180mbps, but on the torrenting machine it is reporting around 10mbps.  So there's my problem.

I turned off the torrents and the vpn and the torrenting machine reported nearly 180 (the same as the other machine).  So I turned on the vpn and it dropped to about 70mps.  Thinking I could deal with that, I turned my torrents back on and BAM!!! back down to 10 mbps.

Is charter somehow throttling my torrents?  Is pia just having issues?  Are my days of sailing the high seas behind me?  wot do?

Boost Issue Good morning all, I am hoping you guys might be able to help me out with something. over the last few days i have noticed an issue with boost in my car, the issue is intermittent. occasionally after startup the car will not produce more than 6PSI of boost, and the wastegate will only go to 60%. my drive for work is a good distance(65 miles) and usually at some point of the drive everything will begin to behave normally, wastegate will go 100% and i will build 25PSI. i also have a separate(possibly related issue) where occasionally during WOT at high RPM and full boost i will get a little smoke/vapor from my exhaust. I am still relatively new to turbos, having come from a supercharged car and still trying to learn everything i can.

as for mods, for reference, i have a GTX2867, intercooler, piping, synapse BOV and custom tune(that for the last year of owning the car has been fine)

i have tested the BOV and it works as intended, there are no leaks in the piping that i can find, and i have tried reloading the tune and resetting ECU and KAM

I have a daughter I didn't know about - What do I do? I'm coming here because I tend to trust the advice of people here moreso than other subs with regard to relationships.

This...requires a little backstory.

About 20 years ago I was involved with someone. We were very young, very silly, and eventually we broke up. We stayed in touch and stayed friends and we always peripherally had feelings for each other but by the time we'd managed to confront those feelings again she'd married and had a child, a girl, with her new husband.

Then about 10 years ago both of us got into a pretty bad place. Her husband has always disliked me because he knew we had feelings for each other and due to a lot of family stress he was ignoring her. I had a relationship end in a pretty bloody way that threw me off the rails something awful.

We spent some time together and...things happened. It was a mistake and I make no excuses for what happened, both of us made poor choices. We didn't use a condom because she was on birth control. This happened a few times until I finally put the brakes on it because I didn't want to cause problems for her daughter.

We went our separate ways for about a year or so and when we reconnected it turns out they had two kids now, both girls.

I didn't really connect the dots at the time but after spending some time around her kids things just didn't add up. Their newest daughter looks uncannily like I did when I was young and nothing like her father. The timeframe fit as well so I talked with my friend and asked her directly.

It...turns out I have a daughter...and I don't really know what to do about that.

We did a DNA test about a week ago and confirmed it. She's biologically my daughter.

I talked with my friend and she said it happened in large part because she was careless and she also thinks it was partially because it was hard to get over us just being friends. The breakup derailed where we both saw our lives going and she had a hard time adapting to that.

I haven't talked to her since the day after the test. I told her I need to just digest all this and I'm...really not sure where to go from here.

I realize this is a huge WOT but I don't really know where else I can ask these kinds of questions.

[Contemporary Fiction] Tiniest Things With a metal-cold *Yale* key held poised to unlock a door he had faced eleven thousand seven hundred and eleven times before Mr H. J. Jenkins stood on the edge of a space that separated two incredibly overwhelming forms of noise that had occupied his life since the age of sixteen. This space was contingently woven together (but by no means exhausted) by twenty-three minutes and approximately two point seven miles, six bus-stops, fourteen avenues, three crescents, ninety-six houses—but since he categorised the bungalows populating his journey home from work as “half-houses” he would say that there were, in reality, only eighty-eight houses if you ever asked him to give a precise number, and although he had never actually been asked about how he categorised houses he secretly, desperately longed to be—two tree-houses, one (now) faded-red post box, four hundred alder wood fence posts, and innumerable blades of grass.

•

He fantasised, for far from the last time, about the painstaking mental and physical fortitude it would require to accurately and successfully count each individual blade of grass that constituted but a single piece of his infinitely dense twenty-three-minute route between work’s oppressively grey fire door exit, with its perennially high-pitched A# screech accompanying its every open, and his own rose-pink front door (a colour of Mrs H. J. Jenkins’ choosing, a mere glancing sight of which was more than enough make him feel extremely nauseous). The walk originally took twelve minutes door-to-door. He had initially accepted the job offer for the pedestrian office job, which he ended up spending three quarters of his life at, because of its proximity to the house and the distinct lack of commuting such proximity afforded. Now that time had almost doubled; an extra road here; an additional turn into a cul-de-sac and through a space dilating chicane there. Short-cuts that weren’t really short-cuts added to diversions. With every deliciously niche and nuanced second he added to his daily circumambulations he felt like he was creating time, not wasting it. He found it funny that every other person alive seemed to derive such little enjoyment from diversions and how such an attitude betrayed the word’s other meanings “amusing” and “entertaining”.

As he lined up his *Doc Marten* encased toes to the passing verge of the sun-tinged turf his mother’s voice skipped through the branching limbic synapses resonating in his skull.

‘In the tiniest of things there is a universe of happenings, Herbie.’

The faintest snap followed an inaudible rustle as he crouched slowly—with his back painfully and severely straight—to tear off a single strip of yellowy-green grass between his thumb and fore-finger.

Standing again—and because he hadn’t moved his back seldom a single millimeter vertically—he imagined himself as representing the start of a perfectly straight imaginary line beaming from the crown of his head and extending up and beyond the slowly passing breeze above. He imagined that if there were an onlooker approaching from his left that she would undoubtedly witness the sketching of a graph. A graph with a human shaped y-axis terminating at a earth-lying x-axis which formed another similarly straight imaginary line that emanated from his toe caps across the field he now faced. These two lines meeting in a fulcrum of laces and leather. The lines were dissimilar, he thought, because the latter would eventually wrap itself around the earth and meet with his heels, while he wasn’t entirely sure if this could be said about the imaginary sky piercing axis. Not letting his lack of knowledge about astronomy stop him from positing fanciful speculations—not even knowing if astronomy was in fact the correct science he needed to know more about in order to make a less fanciful and a more informed speculation—he teased out the possibility that if he climbed the ever extending y-axis through the pale blue, the atmospheres, and then (enough) space that he’d eventually reach the bottom of the universe and start approaching, at a stupidly slow pace, the underside of his boot’s heels; like a non-Euclidean *PAC-MAN* boring through space with stars for fruit.

This incarnate graph with an ankle as its point of origin ostensibly contained a flattened impression of a three-dimensional landscape. In the foreground there was a bluish-grey diamond wire fence dicing up in mini kite like portions a pelican crossing and a row of five terraced Victorian houses, behind and smack-dab in the middle of which was the top of a *Corylus avellana* tree. The tree retreated incrementally back into its roots, like some perverse nature in reverse, the closer to Mr. H. J. Jenkins the onlooker approached until eventually it disappeared. The onlooker with her own graph, her own Cartesian coordinates. Necessarily destined to never coincide with Mr H. J. Jenkins’.

What if all points meet back at where they begin; his graph extending indefinitely and then returning to itself in all directions? Contains itself? Everything?Don’t be silly. Don’t be fucking mad.

Mr H. J. Jenkins shifted his gaze—underscored by a fractionally agape mouth exposing a weird and wet darkness wrapped in two pale-red lips—between the blade of grass now microscopically separating his digits and the grass laid out in front of him.

Grass.

Grass.

Grass.

Grass.

He yearned to count all the grass. He definitely felt like he wanted to fuck the grass. Cross species pollination. He was prepared to abandon living his life for the diligence of subsuming every last strip of grass under concrete cardinality in the hope that each piece would be rendered with the sweet, sappy existence it demanded. His aim being to attach a number to all things on his route so that this might be sufficient enough to transform the world he knew from being something outside him to something interior.

This would be the day.

•

Hot, sick, vomit inducing pink was all he could see when he emerged from his stupor, erection pressed up against his inner thigh, back of his neck hot and dry. He placed the key which was now incredibly hot—due to a combination of the pincer grip he had been unconsciously inflicting on the key and the sun’s rays traveling unimpeded through one of about an average of seven cloudless days afforded to the English year—back into his pocket and turned to enter the six bus-stop sized space he was just about to leave.

Mrs H. J. Jenkins noticed a jagged, key shaped singe on his upper right quadricep as she guided his hunched and heated naked body into the cool running shower at 3:12AM the following morning.

•

Mrs H. J. Jenkins—Mr H. J. Jenkins’ mother i.e., Mrs Hazel Jane Jenkins, not his wife i.e., Mrs Hazel Joy Jenkins (love has no concern for names it seems)—was a serial addict. An addiction addict who never indulged in one of her fleeting predilections for more than around a year and to which she never returned. She was a woman of incredible will power... when she wanted to be. Once she quit something she would never drink, smoke, disco biscuit, huff, puff, bake, drop, tweak, blaze, blow or generally partake of it again.Rocking side to side frenziedly squeezing as much revelry into the last twenty-four-hours of her soon-to-be ex-preoccupation she would religiously recite, as if singing hymns to a newborn, the same stanza over and over.

*If I implore*

*“Don’t exist!”*

*Forever more*

*I shall resist*

With every year that passed and with every addiction she forever abandoned she slowly became, in a weirdly ironic way, an ascetic of sorts as past addictions became a catalogue of abstinences. She ended these annual binges at the mark of a New Year out of sync with the rest of the world’s. Her New Year’s Resolution revolved instead around April 30th; young Mr H. J. Jenkins’ birthday.

Pieced together from old family photos on *Biro*\-dated *Polaroids*, anecdotes from various relatives (close, distant and estranged; the last of whom made the veracity of their anecdotes’ contents doubtful yet contradictorily entertaining due to their blatant hyperbole), and (when he was old enough to have the misfortune of a grown person’s capacity to remember) his own memories Mr. H. J. Jenkins was able to match each of his ages to the appropriate corresponding year of his mother’s addictions.

1 = Alcohol

2 = Caffeine

The result of such an extensive list is that by the age of Sugar—if he was around friends that knew of his mother’s past Mr. H. J. Jenkins would start most stories about his youth with the phrase ‘at the age of Cocaine...’ or ‘must have been around Gambling and Meat when...’—Mrs H. J. Jenkins (for mostly better but occasionally worse) now abstained permanently from twenty-one previous addictions, addictions that she often had no idea she had a problem with until a month before giving them up for good. It was very common for a looming, fully blown addiction to slowly start bleeding into the previous year’s. In a bitter-sweet way Mr H. J. Jenkins sorely missed the ages of eight and nine. It is the only period in his life he remembers running home. Where upon his arrival he’d bask in a T.V.-less home to the sound of his mother playing Satie’s *Gymnopodie No. 1* or a considerably slowed down version of *Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto 1 in B Flat Minor* whose arrangement of notes reached his ears by the very same atoms that carried the smell of either *McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Miss Millie's*, the local Chinese or Indian, or (the oddly named) *Chicken BBQ Fish Bar*—the last of whom’s food he was never able to identify by smell before entering the house because the wide variety of food they cooked easily lent itself to several of the other takeaways’ offerings—straight to his nose as he sped down the front path.

Fifteen was the last great year he could remember, after that his mother’s penchants were beginning to make him increasingly uncomfortable.

‘I don’t need to know any of this. This is all *much* too much information.’

‘I just thought you might wanna to know.’

‘So you, i.e. my mother, thought that I’d want to know that you, i dot fucking e, my MOTHER, have been attending Masturbators Anonymous meetings?’

‘Steps eight and nine, Herbie.’

‘Which are?’

‘Acknowledge those you have harmed and make amends.’ You could see the quotation marks dangling from the edges of her mouth.

‘So the same as every other pseudo-AA-esque group. But I didn’t even know about your problem until you told me just now! You’re definitely doing me harm now though, isn’t that something you should NOT be doing?! Have they got a step for making amends for failed-slash-unnecessary amends? Jesus.‘

Slowly being absorbed by a fifteen year old recently re-upholstered armchair and floating on a prescient sea of half-emptied spilled packets of *Jelly Babies*, *Wine Gums* and *Smarties* whose presence augured a rising tide of sugar, Mrs H. J. Jenkins sat moribund as Mr H. J. Jenkins made the decision that this was the last time he was going to see his mother.

*Aisle 3:*

*Stationery/Books*

The clothes section’s distant tannoy announcements could be overheard overhead and a wall of scissors piercing his eyes with their variously bright-coloured handles was in his direct line of sight. He had no idea how much time he had spent in the store staring at the these columns of metal and plastic. The sprint from his front door to the store he now stood in, with his y-axis smashing through fluorescently fitted ceiling (almost) sky high, made him more perspiration than man. The technique Mr H. J. Jenkins finally decided would achieve the best result for counting his grass was so simple he hated himself for not having thought of it earlier: one blade at a time. Ockham would’ve been bloody proud.

He reduced the utensils he’d need to four essential elements: The Scissors, The Counter, The Paper, The Pen.

In one hand he would have a pair of red handled scissors delicately snipping through each green, earthly fin with the ol’ olfactory working to imbibe the redolent kicked-down-for-the-fourth-time-in-five-days-of-mandatory-P.E.-lessons muddy perfume. In the other hand a tally counter, preferably bright red—just like the scissors—so he could easily find it when he would inevitably drop it in the grass due to exhaustion.

He had accepted his plan was going to be consumingly tiresome. Such a prospect excited him.

In his trousers’ back pocket he’d have the smallest notepad (A6) which would be extremely accessible given his soon to be perennial bent-over-ness, and thus conveniently reachable with a flick of his arm ass-wise, to record the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands as the counter rolled over afresh to ‘0000’ .

Thousands of thousands.

In his top left breast pocket he would place an assortment of pens and pencils. He initially considered using just pencils based on the ease with which he could erase erroneous tally marks he might make, but after finer thinking he thought such errors would be pretty improbable. He’d only be making tally marks every 10,000th snip of grass, after all. Plus, he imagined the pencils were more liable to fall out of his breast pocket when bent over, as compared to pens. The pens’ clip would make them less likely to escape from his pocket as he moved along the grass, head forever gravity-ward. So he opted instead for a mix of both pens and pencils as a happy medium.

Thousands of hundreds of thousands.

To be consumed in the pursuit of something else’s existence was to truly live, he thought. To stop living but not be dead, to think thoughts but not in your head.

‘Sorry scuse me sir you orright?’

‘...’

‘Just coz you’ve bin standing there for like 45 mins and I kinda need to get in there to stock the notepads there.’

Mr H. J. Jenkins slowly extended his arm and picked up the brightest red pair of scissors, not quite as red or as bright as he would have liked, and brought it toward his gaze. He looked back and forth with an introverted smile.

Scissors.

Scissors.

Scissors.

2018-07-24 20:27:05
[MF] Tiniest Things With a metal-cold *Yale* key held poised to unlock a door he had faced eleven thousand seven hundred and eleven times before Mr H. J. Jenkins stood on the edge of a space that separated two incredibly overwhelming forms of noise that had occupied his life since the age of sixteen. This space was contingently woven together (but by no means exhausted) by twenty-three minutes and approximately two point seven miles, six bus-stops, fourteen avenues, three crescents, ninety-six houses—but since he categorised the bungalows populating his journey home from work as “half-houses” he would say that there were, in reality, only eighty-eight houses if you ever asked him to give a precise number, and although he had never actually been asked about how he categorised houses he secretly, desperately longed to be—two tree-houses, one (now) faded-red post box, four hundred alder wood fence posts, and innumerable blades of grass.

•

He fantasised, for far from the last time, about the painstaking mental and physical fortitude it would require to accurately and successfully count each individual blade of grass that constituted but a single piece of his infinitely dense twenty-three-minute route between work’s oppressively grey fire door exit, with its perennially high-pitched A# screech accompanying its every open, and his own rose-pink front door (a colour of Mrs H. J. Jenkins’ choosing, a mere glancing sight of which was more than enough make him feel extremely nauseous). The walk originally took twelve minutes door-to-door. He had initially accepted the job offer for the pedestrian office job, which he ended up spending three quarters of his life at, because of its proximity to the house and the distinct lack of commuting such proximity afforded. Now that time had almost doubled; an extra road here; an additional turn into a cul-de-sac and through a space dilating chicane there. Short-cuts that weren’t really short-cuts added to diversions. With every deliciously niche and nuanced second he added to his daily circumambulations he felt like he was creating time, not wasting it. He found it funny that every other person alive seemed to derive such little enjoyment from diversions and how such an attitude betrayed the word’s other meanings “amusing” and “entertaining”.

As he lined up his *Doc Marten* encased toes to the passing verge of the sun-tinged turf his mother’s voice skipped through the branching limbic synapses resonating in his skull.

‘In the tiniest of things there is a universe of happenings, Herbie.’

The faintest snap followed an inaudible rustle as he crouched slowly—with his back painfully and severely straight—to tear off a single strip of yellowy-green grass between his thumb and fore-finger.

Standing again—and because he hadn’t moved his back seldom a single millimeter vertically—he imagined himself as representing the start of a perfectly straight imaginary line beaming from the crown of his head and extending up and beyond the slowly passing breeze above. He imagined that if there were an onlooker approaching from his left that she would undoubtedly witness the sketching of a graph. A graph with a human shaped y-axis terminating at a earth-lying x-axis which formed another similarly straight imaginary line that emanated from his toe caps across the field he now faced. These two lines meeting in a fulcrum of laces and leather. The lines were dissimilar, he thought, because the latter would eventually wrap itself around the earth and meet with his heels, while he wasn’t entirely sure if this could be said about the imaginary sky piercing axis. Not letting his lack of knowledge about astronomy stop him from positing fanciful speculations—not even knowing if astronomy was in fact the correct science he needed to know more about in order to make a less fanciful and a more informed speculation—he teased out the possibility that if he climbed the ever extending y-axis through the pale blue, the atmospheres, and then (enough) space that he’d eventually reach the bottom of the universe and start approaching, at a stupidly slow pace, the underside of his boot’s heels; like a non-Euclidean *PAC-MAN*boring through space with stars for fruit.

This incarnate graph with an ankle as its point of origin ostensibly contained a flattened impression of a three-dimensional landscape. In the foreground there was a bluish-grey diamond wire fence dicing up in mini kite like portions a pelican crossing and a row of five terraced Victorian houses, behind and smack-dab in the middle of which was the top of a *Corylus avellana* tree. The tree retreated incrementally back into its roots, like some perverse nature in reverse, the closer to Mr. H. J. Jenkins the onlooker approached until eventually it disappeared. The onlooker with her own graph, her own Cartesian coordinates. Necessarily destined to never coincide with Mr H. J. Jenkins’.

What if all points meet back at where they begin; his graph extending indefinitely and then returning to itself in all directions? Contains itself? Everything?Don’t be silly. Don’t be fucking mad.

Mr H. J. Jenkins shifted his gaze—underscored by a fractionally agape mouth exposing a weird and wet darkness wrapped in two pale-red lips—between the blade of grass now microscopically separating his digits and the grass laid out in front of him.

Grass.

Grass.

Grass.

Grass.

He yearned to count all the grass. He definitely felt like he wanted to fuck the grass. Cross species pollination. He was prepared to abandon living his life for the diligence of subsuming every last strip of grass under concrete cardinality in the hope that each piece would be rendered with the sweet, sappy existence it demanded. His aim being to attach a number to all things on his route so that this might be sufficient enough to transform the world he knew from being something outside him to something interior.

This would be the day.

•

Hot, sick, vomit inducing pink was all he could see when he emerged from his stupor, erection pressed up against his inner thigh, back of his neck hot and dry. He placed the key which was now incredibly hot—due to a combination of the pincer grip he had been unconsciously inflicting on the key and the sun’s rays traveling unimpeded through one of about an average of seven cloudless days afforded to the English year—back into his pocket and turned to enter the six bus-stop sized space he was just about to leave.

Mrs H. J. Jenkins noticed a jagged, key shaped singe on his upper right quadricep as she guided his hunched and heated naked body into the cool running shower at 3:12AM the following morning.

•

Mrs H. J. Jenkins—Mr H. J. Jenkins’ mother i.e., Mrs Hazel Jane Jenkins, not his wife i.e., Mrs Hazel Joy Jenkins (love has no concern for names it seems)—was a serial addict. An addiction addict who never indulged in one of her fleeting predilections for more than around a year and to which she never returned. She was a woman of incredible will power... when she wanted to be. Once she quit something she would never drink, smoke, disco biscuit, huff, puff, bake, drop, tweak, blaze, blow or generally partake of it again.Rocking side to side frenziedly squeezing as much revelry into the last twenty-four-hours of her soon-to-be ex-preoccupation she would religiously recite, as if singing hymns to a newborn, the same stanza over and over.

*If I implore*

*“Don’t exist!”*

*Forever more*

*I shall resist*

With every year that passed and with every addiction she forever abandoned she slowly became, in a weirdly ironic way, an ascetic of sorts as past addictions became a catalogue of abstinences. She ended these annual binges at the mark of a New Year out of sync with the rest of the world’s. Her New Year’s Resolution revolved instead around April 30th; young Mr H. J. Jenkins’ birthday.

Pieced together from old family photos on *Biro*\-dated *Polaroids*, anecdotes from various relatives (close, distant and estranged; the last of whom made the veracity of their anecdotes’ contents doubtful yet contradictorily entertaining due to their blatant hyperbole), and (when he was old enough to have the misfortune of a grown person’s capacity to remember) his own memories Mr. H. J. Jenkins was able to match each of his ages to the appropriate corresponding year of his mother’s addictions.

Tuned Volkswagen GTI violently jerks/lunges during peak boost/torque upshifts I've been trying to solve this issue for half a year and decided to post here for some advice.

I have a 2012 Volkswagen GTI (dsg/auto) with an ECU tune (custom tune via a popular tuning company), air intake (Neuspeed P-Flo), and an aftermarket resonator (Vibrant Bottle Style 1792).

If I am cruising in drive and apply even and smooth throttle, the turbo will lag like an other turbo'd car. Once this lag ends, the car will blast off but it'll horribly jerk forward during the 3rd to 4th upshift and 4th to 5th upshift. It's so violent it shakes your body when it lunges forward. This usually occurs when it shifts around 4k RPMs at peak boost and torque levels.

If I remove the tune and go back to stock mode via my Cobb Accessport, this does not happen at all. Every shift is as smooth as butter no matter what kind of throttle I apply (even WOT). I can even run Cobb's "off the shelf tune" Cobb Stage 1+ and that is still as smooth as stock mode. This issue ONLY occurs when I'm running the custom tune from the reputable company.

After going back and fourth with the company, even with data logs and revisions, they cannot seem to fix this issue. After surveying around for months, some users of this tune have had this exact issue, but the majority have not. Even GTI's on the stock TCU software don't have this issue.

Does anybody have the slightest clue of what could possibly be wrong? These jerky upshifts only occur with this specific tune and not the less powerful ones. It's even more tricky considering identically modified cars with the same tune do not have this issue (only a handful do). Any insight on this issue is appreciated! I love my custon tune for the power it puts out, but it's shifts are unbearable.

After 5+ years since the build was done I've never gotten around to having the car tuned. Now it's finally tuned for WOT! Got some buttoning up to do, larger fuel pump and more boost etc. This car keeps me from wrenching on the Viper. Or anything else for that matter... Had it since I was 14.

Question about engine braking, “lugging” I’ve watched and read hours worth of takes on whether you should downshift when coming to a stop. It’s incredible and infuriating how there are so many people on both sides. So I’m not looking to be convinced one way or the other right now (but feel free to try).

I’ve come to the conclusion that in most cases, say, coming to a stop light in fourth gear, I’m either going to not downshift at all, or possibly rev-match and downshift to third gear. Then I’m going to use the engine and brakes to slow down, and put it in neutral for the last little bit. It’s this last little bit I’m here to discuss.

My question: if I’m getting close to a complete stop, say, 15 MPH, and I’m in third or fourth gear and obviously very low RPM, is this hard on the engine in a similar way that going WOT in a high gear at low RPM is hard on the engine? I wouldn’t do this, but for the sake of reason, would it be hard on the engine to be in 4th gear and shift to neutral a moment before the car bogs down and dies?

Bike extremely sluggish while in gear, graceful when not in gear Hi. I have a bike problem that is beyond my expertise.

Background: Bike is a 2004 Vulcan 500LTD, carbed. It sat for ~6 months before I bought it. I bought it, let it sit for a month, then got my liscence and rode it around town. After about a month of this, the bike ran on only 1 cylinder. Before the 1 cylinder issue, the bike took off like a bat outta hell. Extremely fast(for me, 0-60 was about 7 seconds give or take). I took the carbs apart, cleaned them, put them back in. Bike runs like a total champ in nuetral. I can bring it to redline and back with no hiccups, and the RPMs climb extremely fast. The bike sat for about a month in-between the 1 cylinder issue and me finally cleaning it.

Problem: In gear, my 2003 suburban accelerates faster. No joke. I'd recon the 0-60 is now 12 seconds? 13? In addition to that, when I fully let off the throttle, engine braking hits me like a truck. It's almost like I have the brakes on. If I pull in the clutch, engine braking stops, so I know it's not my actual brakes.

In addition to that, the RPMs climb extremely slowly in gear. I can go WOT and it sounds, and feels, like a slow acceleration. The kind you'd use going through a school zone.

My first words, upon getting on the bike after cleaning the carbs, were "did someone nueter my bike?" It's pitiful.

Aside from that, when I'm stopped there is a slight and intermittent "burbling" from the left side of my bike. I don't know if this is related.

Here's what I've noted:

Oil is 2 months old and has 200 miles on it.

Spark plugs are new

Fuel is 1/2 1 month old 91 octane, 1/2 1 day old 89 octane, with a splash of b-12(carb clean).

Again, bike revs perfectly in nuetral, so I think that rules out a fuel delivery/air/spark problem



Anyone have ideas?

If I was not specific enough, please tell me.

Bike sluggish in gear, graceful in nuetral Copy and paste from a /r/ motorcycle post

It's almost like I have the brakes on. If I pull in the clutch, engine braking stops, so I know it's not my actual brakes. This didn't used to happen, but I might have simply forgotten about it in the month of no riding.

In addition to that, the RPMs climb extremely slowly in gear. I can go WOT and it sounds, and feels, like a slow acceleration. The kind you'd use going through a school zone.

My first words, upon getting on the bike after cleaning the carbs, were "did someone nueter my bike?" It's pitiful.

Aside from that, when I'm stopped there is a slight and intermittent "burbling" from the left side of my bike. I don't know if this is related.

Here's what I've noted:

Oil is 2 months old and has 200 miles on it.

edit 3: The bike is leaking oil onto the spark plugs. I tightened the bolts up a litte, and it wasn't a bad leak at all, but I felt like it needs to be mentioned.

Front tire pressure was 7PSI when I stopped to fill it up to 28. The tool couldn't reach my rear tire stem. Could a low rear tire cause this?

Spark plugs are new

Fuel is 1/2 1 month old 91 octane, 1/2 1 day old 89 octane, with a splash of b-12(carb clean).

EDIT: 2: I should mention, the carb wasn't just cleaned. It was a complete rebuild using a rebuild kit. While I was putting the carb on the bike, I turned the carb upside down and hear the float/float needle move around in 1 carb. In the other carb, if I turned it upside down, I didn't hear the float/float needle move. This might be a red herring, it might be the problem.

Again, bike revs perfectly in nuetral, so I think that rules out a fuel delivery/air/spark problem

Anyone have ideas?

If I was not specific enough, please tell me.

EDIT: Before you say, "are you sure you're not just imagining it", here's a video of another vulcan doing 0-60.

54 seconds

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u52NIK8tUM

My bike would take at least 2x as long. Before the carb clean and 1 cylinder issue, it ran just like this.

Problem: In gear, my 2003 suburban accelerates faster. No joke. I'd recon the 0-60 is now 12 seconds? 13? In addition to that, when I fully let off the throttle, engine braking hits me like a truck. It's almost like I have the brakes on. If I pull in the clutch, engine braking stops, so I know it's not my actual brakes. This didn't used to happen, but I might have simply forgotten about it in the month of no riding.

In addition to that, the RPMs climb extremely slowly in gear. I can go WOT and it sounds, and feels, like a slow acceleration. The kind you'd use going through a school zone.

My first words, upon getting on the bike after cleaning the carbs, were "did someone nueter my bike?" It's pitiful.

Aside from that, when I'm stopped there is a slight and intermittent "burbling" from the left side of my bike. I don't know if this is related.

Here's what I've noted:

Oil is 2 months old and has 200 miles on it.

edit 3: The bike is leaking oil onto the spark plugs. I tightened the bolts up a litte, and it wasn't a bad leak at all, but I felt like it needs to be mentioned.

Front tire pressure was 7PSI when I stopped to fill it up to 28. The tool couldn't reach my rear tire stem. Could a low rear tire cause this?

Spark plugs are new

Fuel is 1/2 1 month old 91 octane, 1/2 1 day old 89 octane, with a splash of b-12(carb clean).

EDIT: 2: I should mention, the carb wasn't just cleaned. It was a complete rebuild using a rebuild kit. While I was putting the carb on the bike, I turned the carb upside down and hear the float/float needle move around in 1 carb. In the other carb, if I turned it upside down, I didn't hear the float/float needle move. This might be a red herring, it might be the problem.

Again, bike revs perfectly in nuetral, so I think that rules out a fuel delivery/air/spark problem

Anyone have ideas?

If I was not specific enough, please tell me.

EDIT: Before you say, "are you sure you're not just imagining it", here's a video of another vulcan doing 0-60.

54 seconds

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u52NIK8tUM

My bike would take at least 2x as long. Before the carb clean and 1 cylinder issue, it ran just like this.

Finally buying an exhaust. Any opinions? So I’ve had by 14’ BRZ for about a year and a half now, but I’ve only done aesthetic mods so far (valentis, sidemarkers, convex mirrors). I finally have some money aside for me to start digging into “real” mods. Exhaust (catback) first, then probably new shoes and skirts.

I’m looking at the Perrin catbacks and right now I’m stuck between the 2.5 Resonated, 2.5 Non Resonated and the 3.0 Resonated. Any input here would be really appreciated, even input on exhaust systems I’m overlooking.

These are my thoughts on the options:

2.5 Res: I don’t want to wake up any of my apartment neighbors with this car. I just want a nice deeper tone to the exhaust with a nice WOT sound.

2.5 Non-Res: I’ve heard the 2.5 Res is almost too quiet, and the non Res with only the catback sounds better, and still not too loud/droney. The only thing here is I would love some FI later on (wayyy later on). I keep seeing non-res is not the way to go with FI and I don’t want to re-buy an exhaust.

3.0: Not waking up the neighbors, but still a bit deeper than the 2.5. I’ve heard 3.0 is better for FI, so it would set me up down the line, but I’ve also heard 2.5 won’t hurt that much with FI.

Sorry for the super long question but I want to make sure I get the right exhaust on this thing. YouTube audio clips only help so much and I want her to sound a bit more aggressive without sounding like a ricer. Haha

Thanks!

hob's campaign \&gt;At the end of a dungeon in 5e campaign

\&gt;All the while we had to deal with stupid puzzles the DM created

\&gt;Run through dungeon cause we know most of his tricks by now

\&gt;On the way elf rogue comes across a pillar with weird writing

\&gt;No one could figure it out even the halfling wizard

\&gt;Can't do shit cause I'm a stupid barbarian

\&gt;At the end of the dungeon

\&gt;No idea what the pillar means but maybe boss might have a clue

\&gt;Two bosses, gynosphinx and androsphinx

\&gt;We fuck them up

\&gt;I chopped off the gynosphinx's head spare the androsphinx

\&gt;No loot drops from the bosses

\&gt;Look around the boss room for some stash

\&gt;A hidden button opens a secret room

\&gt;Nice big chest in the middle of the room

\&gt;Elf opens the chest and finds it's fucking empty

\&gt;U wot m8

\&gt;No fucking loot at the end of the dungeon

\&gt;Look for more shit but can't find anything so we're about to leave

\&gt;Elf reminds us about the pillar

\&gt;Still haven't solved the big secret in the dungeon

\&gt;Still haven't solved that stupid pillar

\&gt;I asked the androsphinx

\&gt;Laughs at us saying how easy the puzzle was

\&gt;And the sphinx finally said to me:

\&gt;"Go to the pillar and read the first letter of every line"

My mum redirects all her problems onto me Ever since I was 13 (17 now), my mum redirects all her stress and work problems onto me. She could come home from work and I’m just sitting in my room, and she would flip at me blaming me for something out of my power. Her problems mainly come from work and her parents (they live overseas with deteriorating health problem), and I feel as though she blames me for them although she doesn’t explicitly say so. She just vents all her frustration and anger on me, without realising how it impacts me.

Now that I’m a bit older and have some money of my own, I often don’t come home until 9-10pm mainly to avoid this toxic environment at home. It impact on my mental health and she prevents me from achieving my goals just to satisfy her needs. Every time I talk to her about it she just yells at me and says “I am older I know what is best for you etc” and “your too young to have your own opinions and values” WOT THE FUCK. I get treated like I’m fucking 5, and she thinks I am incapable of taking care of myself, because I avoid being around her as much as possible.

I have all these ambitions once I’m out of high school. I’m really set on this one scholarship at uni I’m trying to get, which would definitely change my mums attitude about me if I get it.  And I’ve been studying my ass off and doing a bunch of extra curricular activities to build up my cv. And my mum tells me “don’t aim to high, just focus on the small things first” FUCK YOU.

She’s holding me back from doing all these things I want just so I can be her little baby. Fucking help idk what to do. Can’t wait till I’m 18 in a few months

Rockwool fibers popping out of the panels, should I be worried? High density rockwool isn't very common in my country. Only two factories manufacture it and I had to purchase it directly from them. Unlike the rockwool I've seen on the internet, the one i got was kinda squishy and less rigid (that's the reason it was sewed with a layer of metal net, to keep it rigid-ish). Upon touching it, your hands/gloves would get all covered up with the fibers. Very itchy (or may I say prickly).

Made wooden panels, covered the back with white cloth which was kinda thick. Couldn't see any fibers popping out from the back. But decided to cover the front with a cotton polyester (not really sure of the material though, its called a wash-n-wear fabric here). The front fabric was relatively thinner than the back and the fibers seem to be sticking out from here. Before getting the panels in the room I tried blowing a couple of panels with an air blower. The fibers on top of the black cloth did not seem to disappear so I assumed they are just stuck in there.

I ended up making 30 panels for the room. [Here are a couple of pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/wI8ZSD6)

Its around 10 days and the acoustics of the room sound beyond amazing. Aside from the slight distinct smell which hasn't gone yet, everything seems fine. Today my brother came in the room and was like, bro this thing is harmful, I can see little fibers popping out of the panels. I convinced him that they were just stuck in there, then he went like saying that the size of the fibers are so tiny that you just can't see them, its all in the air and you're breathing it all in. This got me a little worried even though I had read about the health hazards of rockwool. The fact that my rockwool was very different from the ones on the internet got me a little more worried.

I ended up calling the factory guys and explaining to them the whole situation that I made such panels and have hung them indoors. The factory guy was like, 'bro you mad or wot? a thin layer of fabric isn't enough to stop the fibers from leaking', to which I asked him if covering the panels with a layer of polythene would do the job. He replied by saying na, the fibers might still leak. He suggested me to cover it with wood. I'm really not sure if covering with wood is a good/feasible idea. The dude did assure me that the rockwool is not cancerous (just what the internet says). What he said was that the tiny particles inject themselves into the skin and that takes a couple hours for the itch to go away. I haven't experienced such a thing.

Anyway, what do you guys think I should do to as a precautionary measure. I spend an average of 9 hours in the room daily with the fan on and make sure the window is opened at least 5 to 6 hours a day. Would covering the panels with a thick layer of plastic (polythene) help? is it even necessary? I don't feel no itch or breathing problems though. Any long-term problems i should be aware of?

Repost: Brief overview of the history of grime by /u/Reflex2011 in an askreddit thread. Since old posts can be deleted, and this deserves to stay alive, reposting [from 4yo post](https://www.reddit.com/r/grime/comments/2bhrhc/pinned_topic_brief_overview_of_the_history_of/):

[I uploaded for Proof it was posted by /u/Reflex2011 and not myself](http://i.imgur.com/5g7hgqm.jpg)

Text below incase of some sort of dramatic coincidence it is unavailable.

"Grime has more of its roots from UK Garage rather than Hip Hop to put it very briefly UK Garage was club music of the 90s and early 2000s, particularly in London where Grime comes from.

Here's the timeline on how it slowly evolved.


A typical 2 step garage song, as you can hear it's a fasted paced beat but hasn't really got much lyrics to it but it was something typical of Garage at the time, and is a sub genre of a genre called speed garage which again has its roots in jungle and drum and bass.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF97KFfMIaY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcO8NZSGCA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_oLMEVHZSc


Then producers would incorporate the fast temp beat to a more soulful sound to it, Now this is when Garage really took off late 90s early 2000s with songs being charted Craig Daivd coming out, and the whole of London was listening to this sound. I feel personally MJ Cole is the greatest Garage Producer, but as you can hear it still sounds like a club tune but with soul influences

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiRMzC4aKVQ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHFFol-8REI

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0kQj7uCxBE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw-Fl_xGpyY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvVIyKHXJ9U

Here is when the roots of Grime started coming through, we had producers who liked the soulful sound but wanted harder beats.
Wookies Battle was a great example of this a harder beat but still has its soulful vibes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nggZE0A9nE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWM5SbBUOw

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULFQVzFt6RY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhKypM3H0iY

So a few years down Garage was a HUGE breakout sensation in London, And since Garage was such a big hit in London MCs (rappers) started MCing over UK Garage songs to hype up a crowd they weren't the main attractions but it took influences from Jamaican Dancehall events and jungle sets where there would be MCs. And because of this Artist started MCing over beats here is where the (rapping) comes into the genre, again a harder beat but now with MCs. And as you can hear there really isn't much lyrics to it but rather simple words to hype a crowd up but in a song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ-27rdwJPs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5PXdScoOrg

Now Garage was a mix between the old school soulful sound and the harder sound but both would be played and mixed together seamlessly since the beat was still all made on the same tempo. By this time its early 2000s and the mix of the two sounds was just widely considered UK Garage. And with the growing trend of MCs on a song of course Lyrics would be improved. Here is probably the breakout song with an all MC crew over a garage beat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7VhofoV3qs

A typical Garage event sounded like this, DJ EZ probably the most well know and best Garage DJ.
The night will start off slow with soulful sounds of Garage but as the night went on and things started heating up an MC would come into place to really hype up the crowd as well as the song played will be alot harder, and to end the night of course you have to have everything chill back out slow dance with a girl and dance until  the night was over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OraL6lKoyXE

Now in the mid 2000s this is where Garage and Grime have a blending together, some DJs would play these songs but others considered it something different and wouldn't, I should add onces the MCs took priority over the UK Garage scene ( people consider MCs destroyed Garage) was when troubles happened at clubs and Garage nights would be canceled by the police in fear of violence.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTek4AdPkik

Mid 2000s and UK Garage is almost a dead genre with radio stations not playing the music since it seemed to glorify violence so it went back underground and only certain clubs would play Garage, but here is when the whole Grime scene truly started, when a guy called Wiley (An old school MC and producer for both Jungle and UK Garage) came out with a song called "Wot Do You Call It".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1YKFV45M18

Now the 2step soulful sound of Garage is dead! no one is making it and no one is playing it, and as such Grime is well and truly taken off with Dizzee Rascals album "Boy in da Corner" winning a mercury award.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3awpTfbpyyc

And from there Grime came about, but just like the music scene in London its ever growing and Grime slowly faded back to the underground and slowly a new genre arrived called DubStep, and im sure when listening to Grime songs you can see the influences producers slowing down the beat and making it a lot darker but with no MCs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qVsNPxdE8

I missed out on a few other steps on the whole evolution and how UK Garage its self held big influences from drum and bass and Jungle music."

A catch-up and some good news... Hi, all (again!). This is by way of an update on this post here, from some days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/92bbif/my\_spideysenses\_are\_tingling\_but\_im\_not\_sure\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/92bbif/my_spideysenses_are_tingling_but_im_not_sure_why/)

First, the usual brief back-story - I'm a 48F, who was widowed 4 years ago, with a variety of health problems which mean I can't work just now. My Mum (who is 71 with her own health problems) has decided off her own bat that she's my "registered carer", in spite of not doing much actual physical caring, as such, and is very controlling. If you feel like it, a glance at my post history should fill you in a bit more!

Anyway, as mentioned in the above post I met up with J (Mum's neighbour, who also has a stoma) today, which was actually really nice. She wasn't rude about my Mum - she said she likes her - but has found her behaviour odd. She said that Mum &amp; step-dad can be very self-centred. Whenever she bumps into Mum, she doesn't get a chance to say anything about herself, but Mum will talk "at" her about what she &amp; step-dad have been up to - that's exactly my experience too. She also said that she isn't sure if Mum is quite as poorly as she likes to make out. Apparently Mum was telling J all about it &amp; made it sound as if she was a walking miracle, lucky to survive! :-/ I honestly don't know - I do know that Mum has some quite serious health concerns, and does have pain, but she also manages to do some fairly physical stuff, such as gardening and house-painting for hours which I couldn't do - so who knows?!

J said that I must carry on standing up to Mother - and also that I really didn't seem in need of a "registered carer". She also thinks that Mum loves to have something to worry about!

As for the phone number, I think what happened is that as she was leaving Mum, she called out for Mum to "ring her", or something like that anyway! I'm glad we've caught up, though, and on our terms, not on my Mother's!

And now for some good news! You may remember the stoma bag problem I had. I detailed it in my post yesterday - sorry, I know it's about as interesting as watching paint dry lol! Well, the good news is that my GP's surgery has suddenly relented and I'm back to my usual supply! Wot a fuss eh! Thanks for reading!

Puppo's Cone of Shame adventure! Ok, so Bonnie got spayed today, and she's in a ridiculously oversized Cone of Shame. She's still very much awake at 2 a.m.. I check to see if she's able to eat and drink, because my dumb ass realized how big the cone was. She can eat and drink (using pasta bowls in place of regular bowl. Just put a few nuts in, and she immediately ate them. Peace of mind achieved!)

So, since she's awake, I decide to let Bonnie out to the garden in the CoS to do what she gotta do. She looks at me with a "you wot, m8?" look, as she realizes she has to make her way over the step into the porch. She eventually ends up outside, by either my hand or her own, my brain just farted.  Anyway, on the grass, Bonnie loses her damn mind, tossing her cone head like a whinnying horse. Tossing up gravel with her makeshift shovel. In her tizz, she runs down the back into the steep af garden. In her cone.

I panic myself. I've issues with slopes and steps, and it was dark, so after a second or few more of "wtf do I do, this bitch is going to get stuck behind the Pampas grass," I go inside, turn on the dining room light, return to the wilderness to find Bonnie back at the top of the garden. I sit on the concrete, coaxing her back, but she says "no," and plods down the step onto the grass. She picks her way down, and finds a suitable sacrificial patch. She wees for an easy 30 seconds, and drudges up the path, pausing momentarily as she bonks the CoS on the way. She reaches the makeshift gate, fusses, then marches hence forth. I am amazed. Bonnie reaches the next step, ponders a moment as her cone smacks it, then climbs over. Over she trots, like a stoner after a bad batch of Scooby Snax, to the front door. In awe, I let her in, and she struts into the living room, where she gets stuck and needs my assistance. I check her stitches, much to her chagrin. There's little dots which I hope are just blood. I bring her to her boudoir (the kitchen). Then, after hours of being all confused, she climbs, with some difficulty, into her lovely new bed. She is now asleep.

I am flabbergasted. This pup, who was scared of the CoS, traversed the mighty jungle (garden), and the Cliffs of Death (path and steps), on her own. To think I assumed she needed my help. How audacious of me!  I'm such a proud mama 😊😍

My roommate is basically a carbon copy of the "humungus wot" lady. She says I can't have guests, threatens legal action against me and even threatened to make false police reports about me and my guest/s if I bring even 1 person over because she is offended by strangers. She's 38 and I'm 25; I'm truly at a loss, I find it unbelievable that this situation is even happening in student housing. I've been nothing but polite and courteous to her. I spoke to management about the issue and it was supposed to be resolved because guests are very much allowed. Besides limiting my conversations with my roommate, is there anything else I can do?

Not only did you flat out ask me if I worked at my job (DID MY UNIFORM GIVE IT AWAY??) you managed to ask me if I was even eligible to work where I work, and if I had legal papers and an I.D... Are you seriously one step forward, three steps back? Who wants to be somewhere for no stinkin’ reason, wearing a stinkin’ uniform with a stinkin’ logo from a stinkin’ company for bloody fun?! Raise your stinkin’ hand! Wot!? Nobody?

I hope you run into every goddamn stop light. I hope you get a tasty blowjob from a guy named Jim, mistaking for your wife.
You had the audacity to ask me— ask me if I worked “here,” 1 minute after closing out your account for you to catch the shuttle to get to the airport. You even asked me if you could leave the rented car seat in the car. You said you didn’t trust me. Well, sir, you’re the most racist bigoted, ignorant, man I’ve ever met and I hope you find this and read this. Goodnight Nathan. I hope the devil sucks your dick better than your wife and son. Because hell is where you’re going

I don't know what to do (WoT) My parents believe I am addicted to my computer or the internet. I believe I have a problem with that, but I'm not addicted. Internet and videogames are my coping mechanisms and the problem is I abuse them to the point they are unhealthy. They are not the cause, they are the symptom of another problem.

&amp;nbsp;

Last weekend I was feeling depressed after weeks of feeling just normal, with a lot of negative thoughts but without the bad feelings, it's hard to explain. The thing is it hit me really hard.

&amp;nbsp;

My family and I usually go to our village on Sunday to have lunch with grandma and more members of our family. I didn't want to go, I wanted to be alone, I didn't want to stand the rest of my family, but I made an effort and I went.

&amp;nbsp;

After lunch I tried to be alone there, the house is huge so there are plenty of rooms to stay and not be bothered, but the very moment I wasn't around I heard them alarmed "Where is Schultz?!?!" and they found me and they kept asking me questions about the future, triggering my anxiety and making me even more depressed.

&amp;nbsp;

I told them I wanted to go home, so I asked for the keys of the car, I'd drive home and go back for them when they wanted. They said no. My mom said we could leave in two hours. It was a lot of time.

&amp;nbsp;

I went outside, there is a garden / farmyard there, my grandpa used to breed calfs there and after retiring he turned it into something like a garden. I go there sometimes when I want to be alone. For some reason there is a donkey from a neighbour, I knew that, but the problem is the fucking ass won't leave you alone, it follows you and invades your personal space.

&amp;nbsp;

I went back home, my mom told me we were leaving soon. So just before leaving my mom told me to go wake up my father from his nap. He seemed upset, he asked me if I had plans or something.

&amp;nbsp;

So we got in the car, my father removed the thing you put in the car to cover it from the sun. It was hot and he left it just behind the steering wheel before turning the car on. He didn't put it away so he couldn't see, but he turned the car on. I put my earphones on because I didn't want to listen to them, I just wanted to be alone, but I could hear them.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom said "Give me the thing (whatever it is called)", for some reason I thought she told my father, who was driving already, but at the same time I thought I should gave it to her because again, my dad was driving. I also thought he shouldn't have started driving with the damn thing there and that it may still be hot and I didn't want to get burn, so my father would tell her it was too hot or something, but he gave it to her while driving. Then all of them starting to say things like "You don't hear us, right? You shouldn't be co-pilot if you are going to put your earphones" and some more hurtful things about how bad I was at it.

&amp;nbsp;

The best one was from my father: "You are useless". The way he said it didn't sound like it was just because I put my earphones on as a co-pilot or because I woke him up from his nap, it was because he really believes I am useless. I am not like him, he was a ladies man when he was younger, he is social and hard working and I'm asocial and a terrible student that is costing him thousands to get a college degree and now I can't get an internship or a job, I am doing nothing all the summer and still on the weekend I manage to bother all of them at the same time because I just want to go home and play videogames (I'm sure that's what he believes, because they think I'm addicted).

&amp;nbsp;

My mom wanted to spend the day there and leave after having dinner, but we left early because of me.

&amp;nbsp;

Tomorrow my parents will go to the village again, same plan: have lunch with the rest of the family and leave after having dinner. I told them I wasn't going so they could do whatever they wanted. They didn't like it. My mom asked me to go with them. I don't know what to do, honestly. I want to go, see my grandma and spend some time there, but I don't want to stay there all day or piss them off again.

most reliable hi cap mags &amp; darts Hiya there.

So, I'm still experimenting with my cool new nerf gun (a Regulator).

...and i'm still getting a lot of jams. It runs ok on the 10 dart stick mags it came with, but it's able to eat them pretty quick so I'd like to be able to feed it hi-cap 18 dart sticks or 35 dart drums. But they seem to keep jamming.

I grabbed a couple of 'job lot' listings off ebay (*) and I have 10x 18 dart sticks here. And four 35 drums. All of them are second hand and of unknown providence, but none of them will run reliably and feed smoothly without jamming. If I'm lucky I can run through an 18 stick without having to whack the side of the gun or open the jam door, but even then the fire rate is a bit random suggesting they still ain't feeding quite right.

Now, a dart gun wot won't shoot isn't much fun.

So then, what can I do about it? I understand there are replacement springs for the 35rnd drums available from the states
which leaves the 18rnd sticks and the darts.

1) other than 'new and in good condition', do some darts feed better than others? Is there any way I can modify them to improve how well they feed?

2) I tried taking one of the mags apart to lubricate it. It seems to feed a bit better/smoother/quicker but still jams. And opening it up seems to have unsettled the spring a bit so i'm not sure it was the cleverest of ideas. Many of the other mags seem glued shut and completely unserviceable. Is it worth trying to rub some white spirit inside them to clean them? Squirt some lube inside? Is there anything else I can do to help them work better?

3) Is there a brand of hi cap mags that seems to work better, or are they all basically identical? Ie is it worth buying brand new worker / nerf / ? mags, or are they unlikely to be any better than the best of the second hand ones I have already?

4) Are there any 'easy' (&amp;) mods I can do to the gun to help it feed better?


(*) = I was lucky and got several that went cheap because they were local and the sellers didn't want to post heaps of toy blasters.
(&amp;) = I do intend to get stuck into modifying it sooner rather than later, but am still very new so lots of learning to do first. One of the reasons for buying random blasters on ebay to serve as test cases.

Oz God's Pre-Draft Post-Truth Captain Interrogations (Part 4.2 of 0) [Taurus](https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/9/18/1379525219652/Daniel-Radcliffe-in-Equus-010.jpg) -  Captain of The ConBots

* Number of bullfights sabotaged: 14.
* Number of accidental gorings sustained while sabotaging bullfights: 6.
* Astrology reading for today: “Beware faux journalists.”

*Okay, let’s start the second half on the right-*

Hola, senior egotist.

*What the fuck.*

[Taurus and an actual bull are in the interrogation room. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God has no idea how Taurus managed to get the animal in here, but it quite honestly frightens him. Not as much as being face to face with a bull frightens him, but still frightens him a bit. On a more lighthearted note, he is mesmerized by Taurus’s exotic accent and how the way in which he rolls his r’s reminds The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God of sweet cherries coated in milk chocolate being dipped gently into his ear holes. His panties moisten despite the fact he isn’t wearing any today.]

Please, sit. But do not make any sudden movements. Eduardo does not like sudden movements.

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God takes a stance at the table which offers him the choice to uselessly flee to either side. The imprint of Fender’s face offers no protection or advice, nor does the dried blood. The trace amounts of cocaine might.]

*So, uhhh… a real bull, huh?*

Eduardo is my flame, my muse. I saved him from a bullfight in Barcelona. The magnificent creature had survived for twenty hours and was at his breaking point when I arrived at the arena. I will not regale you with the exciting and tantalizing tale of how I managed to escape with a two ton bull, but needless to say, it was very much like how I fit him into this cramped room.

*Are you even Spanish?*

In this fantasy world of yours anything’s possible, my friend.

*Point taken. And please refrain from any more comments like that, the meta can only withstand so much.*

I acquiesce to your demand, but only on the condition that you do not judge me prematurely.

*I'm scared.*

It is not my confession that should startle you so but your own closed mind should it reject what I an about to tell you. It may be hard for you to believe that Eduardo is more than my companion. He is my lover.

[This is surely the most demented thing that will happen to The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God today.]

*u wot m8.*

[Taurus wraps his arms around Eduardo and glares at The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God like *he's* the most offensive thing in the room right now.]

Is love between man and beast so wrong? Are you in any position to judge my relationship with this fantastical creature? Gaze at his luxurious tail and try to tell me he is of this depressingly bleak Earth. Try to tell me he is undeserving of my affections.

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God begrudgingly admits that Eduardo’s tail has a certain enticing swish to it, but that hardly warrants beastiality. Taurus nuzzles Eduardo. Eduardo nuzzles back. By The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God, the bull nuzzles back.]

I must be off, there is a celebration of interspecies love where I am scheduled to give a speech. I am the keynote speaker and it could generate enough attention for Eduardo and I to receive the reality television show we so desperately wish for. Wish me luck, my bigoted friend.

[Taurus extracts Eduardo from the room in a way that is extremely intriguing, possibly illegal, but not pertinent to this interrogation. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God is left in a state of utter bewilderment. His nonexistent panties, once so achingly full of hope, vigor, and fluids, are now drier than the Gobi desert. It occurs to him that this is by far the furthest Tagpro has been from any discussion thus far.]

[A$ap Caplord](https://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/28059/1-2/adult-t-rex-costume.jpg) - Captain of What Can Dinos Do?

* Number of dino emotes used: Countless
* Number of times he could have done something conducive but instead deferred to ask ‘wcyd’: Very Countless
* Number of times he’s refused to give The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God admin powers in gen chat: Make him admin already you dino fucker

*First and foremost, where the hell did you come up with that team name?*

[dino emote]

*How, what, how are you making that noise and twisting your face like that. That’s not humanly possible.*

[dino emote]

*How the shit.*

[amused dino emote]

*Hold on, The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God is beginning to understand the subtle intricacies of the dino emote.*

[incredulous dino emote that might say, “Understand dino? That unpossible!”]

*Oh yes, he has definitely seen this kind of language before. Caplord’s a crafty bastard but he’s not as clever as he thinks. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God did several tours of duty fighting off the lizard people attempting to infiltrate world governments, and what are dinos but oversized lizards?*

[aggitaged dino emote that probably says, “Lizards were friends! How dare you!”]

*Friends they might have been, but they stood no chance against us.*

[Caplord finally reveals his true form as that of a dino saboteur. This has been a long time coming between him and The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God. It shall be their final battle. Dinolord screeches and flies at The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God, but unbeknownst to Dinolord, he was an amateur gator wrestler in his heyday. He swiftly dodges and snags the dino in a headlock.]

*Where’s your lair?! The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God knows you have a subterranean hideout somewhere, goddamnit!*

[rebellious dino emote that says, “I’ll never tell! You’ll have to kill me first!”]

*If that’s the way you want it, we can do this the hard way!*

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God grabs Dinolord’s tail, swings him around a few times, and slams him into the table. His dino fangs sink down and pin him to it.]

[pained dino emote that whimpers, “Teef hur.”]

*You’re the only one who can stop the pain, Dinolord. You know how.*

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God is too cocky for his own good. Dinolord whips his muscular tail around and sends his opponent flying against the opposite wall. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God knocks many wall tiles loose in the impact and is knocked dizzy long enough for Dinolord to dislodge himself.]

[retreative dino emote that yells, “You haven’t seen the last of us, human! The dino’s day shall come again!”}

[Dinolord shrieks one last time and claws through the interrogation room’s southern wall and escapes before The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God can stop him. The final battle is in reality the penultimate battle.]

*Scaly son of a bitch!*

[Dinolord is gone. However, he has committed one fatal flaw. A single fang is still stuck in the table. On its tip is a small amount of soil sample from the tunnel Dinolord chewed out to breach the surface world. A forensic analysis will quickly reveal which region the soil hails from.]

*You may have survived this time, Dinolord, but The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God won’t rest until that asteroid is only the second-worst disaster in dino history. That’s a promise.*

[Armbranch](https://previews.123rf.com/images/milinz/milinz1004/milinz100400020/6811977-arms-embracing-tree-concept-of-human-care-for-nature-preservation.jpg) - Captain of He Love Tree

* Number of trees hugged: Several forests worth.
* Accumulated amount of scovilles from pepper sprays to the eyes: Rough equivalence of a Carolina Reaper.
* Possibility that his activism has saved anything: -5%

[Armbranch’s interrogation is the only one to take place outside. This is because he has chained himself to a tree in the midst of a logging company’s most recent excursion and The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God can’t find the key to the chains. The loggers seem to think of him as some kind of mascot or good luck charm, as they provide him with food and water as they work around his tree. Armbranch himself seems oblivious to this while he struggles to shout anti-forresting slogans over the din of their machines.]

Thanks for coming out to support the trees, man, I really appreciate it. These dudes are straight out of freakin’ FernGully.

*Well, that’s not exactly why The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God came here, but if it tricks you into talking, he wishes to save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, and save those snails.*

Righteous, man!

*Are you going to be able to captain this season while juggling your extracurricular activities?*

Dude, Tagpro’s just a tool for the Man to keep us down. I’m going undercover as a captain to take Lucky down just like I’m taking these loggers down. It’s gonna be so cool dude.

*So you think Lucky represents authority.*

Hell yeah dude, he’s totally part of the establishment! Man, I just, I just really wish the balls didn’t have to pop when they, y’know, when they get tagged. Like, it’s really upsetting. It’s so violent, dude! Why’s it gotta be like that?

[Armbranch breaks out in actual tears.]

Why can’t Lucky just make it so they’re put in timeout, man? They didn’t do anything wrong, they didn’t choose to be controlled by us just for our amusement! It sucks, man, it really sucks!

*You have a kind soul and a soft head, Mr. Branch. Assuming you get out of this predicament, how exactly do you plan on stopping Lucky for his hypothetical crimes?*

Easy, I’m gonna stage a sit-in during all my games. I’ll be sitting in the middle of the map and spamming messages in chat. Yeah my players might get angry at me but someone’s gotta do it, dude. We can’t let this go on. Innocent balls are popping like popcorn and no gives a shit, man! I can’t sit back and let it happen!

*No, The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God supposes you cannot.*

Hey, can you do me a favor?

*The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God will consider it.*

Can you scratch my balls?

*No.*

C’mon man, they’ve been itching for like two hours! I’ve been trying to get all the dumb loggers to scratch ‘em but they just laugh at me and give me more water! Usually by dumping buckets on my head.

*No.*

Alright, fine, I’ll give you fifty bucks. Just help a dude out!

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God sighs and considers his financial situation. The Committee of The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God Related Interests for the Advancement of The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God van is low on fuel and needs a top off to collect the last few captains.]

*Fine, but tell no one.*

My lips are sealed, bro.

[The deed is quickly done. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God’s hand comes back smelling of tree sap and parental disappointment.]

*This hand will have to be destroyed. We’re done here, Armbranch.*

Sweet man, glad I could help you out. Stay cool!

[Armbranch goes back to yelling at the loggers while The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God collects his money and searches online for the closest vat of hydrochloric acid he can find.]

[PASSTHEFLAG](http://derindusun.com/tr/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ernesto-Che-Guevara.jpg) - Captain of Chicago Pubes

* Number of failed revolutions: 3
* Number of memes lost in the fight: 34,236
* Number of good memes lost in the fight: 2

[PTF is in an odd situation as he swaps the comfort of one cell for another. He arrives in the interrogation room a broken man, broken in his war waged against the injustice of memes having been banned on the Tagpro subreddit. Good memes, bad memes, stolen memes, he’s seen it all in his fight for meme justice. He is a man with no past and no future, no history and no direction. The only thing left to him is pain.]

*Seems like you’ve had a pretty bad run of luck, PTF.*

Luck? Luck had nothing to do with it. I was betrayed by those I thought were my friends, those who I trusted with my life. I still hear the memes cry out to me, the cries of doges and ball puns that have been silenced. They were a part of me and now they’re gone. A phantom limb, gone in every sense except the pain.

*Who betrayed you?*

They played me like a damn fiddle!

[He slumps down. The man has obviously gone through psychological torture the likes of which would destroy normal men. He continues speaking without looking at me.]

Why am I still here? Just to suffer?

[He pauses.]

They strapped me down, held my eyes open while they forced me to watch them scroll through page after page of 9gag and ifunny. Endless demotivational posters and pictures of infinite Super Mario 64 cartridges while the submitter brags about, ‘this gem I found at a garage sale xDDDD.’ They tried turning the memes against me. THE MEMES, GODDAMNIT, THE SAME MEMES I’M FIGHTING FOR!

*Jesus fucking Christ….*

Let me go.

*What?*

Let me go! I still have a few loyal to me that I know weren’t behind the betrayal. They’ll ambush the convoy coming to take me back and I’ll escape through the hole in that wall. You can tell the mods I overpowered you.

*The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God isn’t sure that’s a good idea. There are dinos and bulls and cocaine running rampant out there. Oh my.*

You think your interrogations are so different? They might not be meme in nature but they straddle the line. How long until *you’re* a target? How long until they bust down your door and throw you on the other side of this table? You don’t have to join the fighting, but let me go and I’ll make sure you’re protected when the revolution comes.

*The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God… is considering it.*

The memes, Oz. The memes.

*The memes….*

The memes.

*The memes?*

The. Memes.

*The memes.*

THE MEMES!

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God has heard enough. He unlocks PTF’s restraints before he can stop himself and helps the broken man up. PTF is limping but he fights through the pain and hobbles down the hole and onto street level.]

You won’t regret this. I promise.

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God cannot look at him.]

*Go.*

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God listens to PTF scamper down the alley and hopes he hasn’t made a terrible mistake. He reflects on the interrogations so far and comes to the conclusion that only the most neurotic and deranged of individuals could helm a Tagpro team. With only one more left, how much worse could it possibly get?]

[Sir Cle Jerk](http://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/shared/characters/celebrities/mr-hankey.jpg) - Captain of SirCleJerkers

* Number of shits taken: Enough to make a measurable contribution to the destruction of the ozone.
* Number of times talked about shits taken/shits about to be taken: Literally all he talks about on groupme. Dead fuckin’ serious.
* Probability he’s reading this while taking a shit: 99%.

*So good of you to take time out of your busy schedule to talk.*

Can we hurry this up? I really gotta take a shit.

*You just came back from the toilet after keeping The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God waiting for half an hour.*

Mother Nature waits for no man, my friend. S’not my fault my body produces shit at a rate that would make a cow blush.

*Might want to take a look at your diet, but we don’t have time to explore the Eighth Wonder of the World that is your anus. You’re a certified veteran of NLTP, so how does that impact your strategies and how you’re planning to formulate your team’s lineup?*

Well I don’t know about any of that, but I can tell you that the shit I had last night was one of those shits I like to call a ‘colon cleanser,’ you know, the kind that makes you feel like a new man, like you just drank a gallon of prune juice and let all your sins flush out of you, like you just had a poop gremlin climb up in there and clean up like he was being paid triple, like-

*Please stop.*

Of course, before that I had the constipation shits, which can’t even really be called shits if we’re being serious, so the time before that I had the kind of shit that twists your guts up and fights you all the way but once it’s out it feels amazing-

*PLEASE. I have had a long day and I’d like to finish already.*

I’m serious dude, you’re gonna regret it if you don’t let me go take a shit.

*Sir Cle, The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God hardly thinks there’s anything you could do to make me regret-*

Too late! I needed to release the pressure and you didn’t let me!

[Sir Cle jumps up, pops a squat on the table, and pulls his pants down. His extremely elastic balls droop down to such a degree that it’s impossible for them not to submerge themselves in toilet water every time he takes one of his frequent shits.]

*What the FUCK.*

[Try as he might, The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God cannot take his eyes off the two testicular singularities. It’s as if they have a telepathic hold over his mind, forcing him to watch as they swing hypnotically, much like twin pendulums of a grandfather clock. They cascade back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and the patterns they trace in The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God’s mind bestow upon him the date of the Second Coming. Before he can transcribe this information in order to warn others, Sir Cle lets loose with a chunky, voracious fart of the highest magnitude. It is the kind of fart that could strip the paint from a Sherman tank, waft over to Axis territory, and choke out a battle-hardened squadron of German *Schutzstaffel*, utterly embarrassing mustard gas in comparison to the point where it appears no more dangerous than a can of Warheads candy spray.]

[The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God is quickly overwhelmed. In the single whiff he gets before being knocked out, it is a smell that can only be described as the chromosomally-overdeveloped love child between a sopping wet cur dunked in a tank truck of skunk extract and a nursing home in which all residents have been left to ferment in their Huggies for a week straight on a strict diet of warm soured milk and greasy, righteously-pounded Smashburger. The interrogation continues, but interrogator and interrogatee have swapped roles. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God has taken his first nonconsensual steps on the journey towards the true meaning of suffering, and it is stinky.]

[Around this time, it looks like there might be a problem on hand.]

[A literal eruption of shit spews forth from Sir Cle’s ass, hereafter referred to as the Inner Sanctum of Hades. The resulting earthquake is so severe it registers on the Richter scales of major cities in several neighboring states. A busload of small children unfortunate enough to be within a two-block radius of the event horizon are temporarily deafened by the squelching explosion, and in the coming weeks there are several thousand reports of family pets going berserk and attempting to flee through whatever means available, including but not limited to flying through windows and scampering up chimneys. Several pets who chose the chimney unearthed skeletons of men clothed in red suits and fake beards, though the origin and significance of this has yet to be discovered.]

[By this point there’s a slim chance things could spiral out of control.]

This is your fault, boii^ii^ii^ii

[Through the previously unconceivable power of sheer sphincter-splintering fecal expulsion, he has achieved escape velocity, crashing through the roof and leaving the interrogation room in a state which completely demolishing the building and quarantining the city for a SHITCON 1 biohazard scrubbing will never truly exorcise the horrors witnessed here. Several hundred people die in the next few months after being overcome by the smell. The only viable comparison is that of Chernobyl and Fukushima, and even then survivors of those nuclear disasters are heard whispering after news reaches them that, ‘at least we still have our dignity.’ Sir Cle is last seen as a brown shooting star somewhere off in the Andromeda galaxy. The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God is found later on, having not drowned in a flood of poo by way of miraculous intervention. The straw from his drink lodged in his nose and acted as a breathing apparatus. He is resoundly traumatized, spouting delirious conspiracies of Judgement Day’s imminent arrival he divined from, ‘the balls of an angel.’ He makes a full recovery and goes on to pen a bestselling autobiography of his copulation with what will go down in history textbooks as The Smelly Death. This small fortune drains rapidly after a series of short sighted bets on the Cleveland Browns winning the World Series.]

[A hardened shit mask of Fender’s face inexplicably finds its way to the heart of the Amazon jungle, where a tribe of natives worships it as their new god of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.]

[In time it is learned that Sir Cle is actually descended from an alien world of creatures whose longevity depends, in blatant disregard for all laws of physics, solely on the frequency of their bowel movements. Sir Cle has proven once and for all that we are not alone, and that, indeed, everyone poops.]

And with that, captain interrogations are concluded! I hope everyone had a fun time reading these, The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God had several decades of his life shorn off retrieving this information for you dickheads. Never let it be said he didn’t suffer for his art. If you are a captain and were offended by this, please leave a comment and explain why so The Artist Formerly Known as Oz God knows how to satirize you during the next interrogations. Or he might just choose some randos if they leave a comment too, who knows.

Elite 80 seems sluggish - is there anything I can do or do I have the wrong expectations? I have a 1987 Honda Elite 80 (3.8k miles) and it feels slower than I feel like it should. From what I've heard on this sub, I feel like it should do better than the 35-40mph I can get it up to.

Here's what I've done so far:

1. Had to adjust the idle speed. It was idling so quickly the clutch never actually disengaged. Not sure how long the previous owner had it running like this.
2. Changed the engine oil
3. Cleaned out the grease packed CVT roller weight assembly, I also have a set of 8.5g and 4g weights I can try, but haven't installed yet
4. Changed the engine air filter
5. Started running 91 octane. Not sure what gas the previous owner ran in it.
6. Replaced spark plug and battery

When I'm riding at WOT and topped out at about 35-40, something just feels... Sluggish about it. It feels like the engine isn't running very smooth and is losing power intermittently for a very short period, so it feels almost like it's decelerating/accelerating very slightly and constantly.

Any ideas? Carb tuning? Or is it just old and I shouldn't expect much more out of an 87 scooter?

was i the victim of a hate crime at brighton pride my friend and i were staying at a hostel in brighton for pride. on saturday we decided to turn in early for the night (by early i mean just after midnight). a group of straight gap year kids were playing music in the dorm rooms and getting ready to party in town but we and one stranger were the only others there. we asked them to turn the music off and get ready elsewhere but one of them got very nasty with my friend. i stood between myself and her and she got very close to me and started making threats to smack me. we were laughing at her and she did strike me across the face. i got a scratch but it was a soft slap. i threw her on the ground in return and hit her back a few times, then i got up and went to my friend. she had called the police. the security guard must have heard the fuss as he came in and asked what had happened. the other group tried to lie and say i started it but the girl who hit me was not very wise and boasted that she had threatened me and that she had hit me first (‘so wot?’). the only thing i said to the guard was ‘she hit me first’ but they were shouting over me so he wolf whistled to shut us all up. they tried to provoke us as they told the story to him but we just sat on the floor and didn’t respond at all.

then the girl called me a dyke. i asked the security guard to acknowledge it and he did. she said ‘so wot? she is’

the guard said that the group had to leave bc they were the assailants. they spoke to the receptionist on their way out and he decided to kick us out too, which wasn’t very fair. he didn’t even want to hear our side of the story. i at least asked him to acknowledge the scratch on my forehead and he did. the police never came. i had to call someone from hours away to come pick us up, but we had to sit on the beach until 0330 with many creepy men hanging round us. we had to bail a few times because we got freaked out by a few of them. i hope the hostel refund our money but they will try to resist it

was this a hate crime? she called me a dyke **after** she assaulted me.

i feel bad. pride was 50% str8s in festival gear. i wouldn’t put it past any str8 to resort to the d-word the second they want to hurt me. it’s happened too many times now. what an awful word. i don’t want to go to pride anymore

Holy Crap, Glossier Customer Service Is The Best! I just contacted them about maybe getting a refund for a boy brow in clear and Balm Dot Com in Birthday Cake. (the balm had separated, also the smell is gross sorry not sorry.) And I purchased this stuff MONTHS ago. They just sent me a full refund...

I AM SHOCKED AND, FLABBERGASTED, HOLY CRAP I LOVE THEM, WOT?

For anyone else holding onto products they don't like or that broke because the 30 days are up, don't worry. Contact them and see what they say.

Help with a Honda? Hey guys, I never have to ask for help but this has got me stumped.
My dad has a 1991 Accord and for some reason when you are driving it it will start to lose power and bog down and then die. You wait a minute and restart it and you can drive it for a little bit and then it will do it again. It also pops and sputters when you go WOT.


It has had a new cap, plugs, wires, rotor, fuel filter, trans computer and I have replaced the icm in the distributor.

When I replaced the icm the problem seemed to have went away for about a week but it has come back.


The only check engine code is a code 12 for EGR lift valve. This code has been present for more than a year (well before this issue started) I pulled the valve off and checked for carbon buildup and made sure the valve functioned normally. I believe it is the sensor on the egr valve and that it is unrelated to the main issue.

Any ideas?

[HOW-TO] Polished Throttle Body (MZR only!) **DISCLAIMER!** By following this guide, you assume any and all risks if you fuck something up. I am sharing my experience and my processes, you alone are responsible for the outcome.

**SKYACTIV OWNERS:** Don't do this! You have a special coating on your throttle body that inhibits buildup of deposits, and by following this guide, that coating will be removed. You are strongly urged to not do this thing, but I can't stop you.

**QUICK INFO:**
* TIME REQUIRED: 1 hour minimum. Time + Effort = Results!
* DIFFICULTY: 3/5. While the work itself isn't difficult, it requires a steady hand with power tools and you must be careful with the throttle blade and it's mating surface on the horn. If you remove material there, you will have a host of issues.
* COST: I had all the stuff, but the sandpaper is about $4-5/pack at the local wally world, and a polishing attachment for a dremel is probably in the $10-15 neighborhood.

**WHY?** This is a guide on polishing the intake horn on your MZR throttle body. The aluminum casting from the factory is rather rough on the intake horn, and after years of use it can develop some corrosion. These deposits will create a rough surface for the air to flow over and create some unwanted turbulence (not the good kind). Polishing will bring the intake horn to a smooth finish and assist with the flow characteristics at partial throttle as well as WOT.

**TESTING:** This mod has been extensively tested on the following vehicles:
* 2010 MZ3 2.5 6SP (will be drag racing on Friday to see if there are any gains in my ETs)
* 2005 MZ3 2.3 5SP

Both vehicles showed an improvement in throttle response as well as midrange pickup below 3000 RPM. Launching is greatly improved, as is low speed drivability where the throttle is at less than 20%.

**TOOLS:** The required materials are as follows:
* 1 MZR throttle body (duh)
* 1 package of 600 grit wet/dry sandpaper
* 1 package of 2000 grit wet/dry sandpaper
* 1 bottle of lube (I used WD40, you can use soapy water or whatever libation will allow wetsanding to take place)
* 1 Dremel or die grinder with a polishing wheel and some polishing compound.
* Plenty of rags

**HOW-TO:**

1. Pull off your intake. Cars are slightly different, but you should be able to at least expose the 4 bolts on the throttle body rather easily. If you are having trouble with this step, this mod is not for you.

2. Pull off the coolant lines, they will make a mess.

3. Unplug the throttle body electrical connection and make sure both ends stay dry.

4. Using an 8mm socket, take out the 4 bolts and the TB will be free.

5. If you want to bypass the coolant line, remove the short coolant hose from the hard pipe behind the throttle body, and plug in the longer hose from the front of the throttle body. Done.

6. Clean the throttle body and get all the deposits out of there.

7. Take your 600 grit sandpaper and your lube and start sanding the intake horn. Make sure both the sandpaper and the input horn are staying wet, and when you feel the resistance fade, move to a new area. I cut off about a 3" wide strip of sandpaper, and when it gets clogged up, I would cut off the clogged part and continue with a fresh section. Once the strip is used up, I cut off another after cleaning the throttle body.

8. IMPORTANT: THERE IS A BIT OF A LIP LEADING TO THE THROTTLE PLATE WHERE IT SEATS IN THE VENTURI. YOU MAY KNOCK THAT LIP DOWN, HOWEVER LEAVE THE AREA WHERE THE THROTTLE PLATE SEATS ALONE!

9. Once everything is clean and feeling smoother, grab your polishing tool of choice, smear some compound on the buffing wheel, and polish wherever you sanded. I used a good amount of pressure here and got some good results.

10. Repeat with the 600 grit/polishing until you are pleased. For me I did 4-5 passes.

11. Perform the same process with the 2000 grit to make the surface very fine. You will most likely feel like you are starting over from the beginning. That's okay, remember to be patient. I did another 4-5 passes with the 2000 grit and the buffing wheel.

12. When all is said and done, your throttle body input horn should be slightly shiny (does not need to be a mirror finish) and smooth as glass. Hit it again with the throttle body cleaner (or however you want to clean up the mess) and reinstall.

13. If you did not move the throttle plate at all (you shouldn't have needed to) you can bolt it on, plug it in, and attach your intake. If you did move it, remove your negative battery terminal, reinstall the TB and intake, and wait about 5-10 minutes. Attach the ground to the battery and perform an idle learn procedure (5 minutes all accessories on max, 5 minutes all accessories off).

14. Take it for a test drive and feel the difference!

I should be grabbing some photos soon of where not to sand/polish, but my descriptions will make much more sense when you're looking at it. I will post a comment below on my findings after I take it drag racing on Friday.

Feel free to ask any questions about the process, or let me know if I need to explain something in further detail. Thanks for looking!

After Last Stone's Day: All Back To Mine. The first thing that occurred to Rosie, as she surfaced from a deep sleep of satisfaction, was that Prophe had a surprisingly large bed – a magnificent four-poster of lavish dimensions.

The second thing that occurred to her was that Prophe had a surprisingly uncomfortable bed. This damn mattress was no good for her back…

The third thing that occurred to her, as she sat bolt upright, eyes wide, was *why am I in Prophe’s bed?*

Prophe, an elvish Amazon of truly statuesque proportions, was resting with her back against the headboard, one foot on the floor – the repose of a warrior, ready for action at any moment. Her eyes flickered open at Rosie’s movement, and the two women stared at each other with surprise and dawning horror.

Neither of them was wearing a stitch of clothing.

“Why am I…?”  “Why are you…?”  “What did…?”  “Did we…?”

Rosie clutched her aching head. This hangover was the worst she’d ever had.

“Prophe… what *happened* last night?”

Prophe looked pale and greenish. “I… I don’t *know*, Rosie… I don’t remember any of…” She buried her head in her hands. “We… we wouldn’t have? Would we? I mean… well, *I* wouldn’t have…? Surely…”

“What do you mean *you* wouldn’t… oh, right. Fair… look, nothing happened? Agreed?”

“…Agreed. Of course.”

“I should go. Before anybody…”

There was a loud and lengthy yawn from below the sheets to Rosie’s right. Two hands emerged, pulling the sheet down, revealing a striking head of hair, dark with a vivid streak of red…

Elf and halfling spoke as one. “*Audra*?!”

Prophe’s wife opened her eyes and smiled at them sleepily for a moment. Then, as the scene sank in, Audra sat bolt upright, staring. “*Rosie?* What are… what did… Prophe?” Audra looked down. She wasn’t wearing anything either. A blush like sunrise spread across her face and chest. “Did… did we…? Oh no. Ye gods, my *head*. What *happened*?”

“We don’t *know*,” Rosie groaned in despair. “I… I would never… well, probably…”

Prophe bit her lip. “Er… I think… Maybe…”

The others looked at her.

“I… I think I remember something… it’s very blurred… but I think we were discussing. Um. Experience. Experiences. And I think we… Audra and I… I think we might have sort of asked you to. Er. Teach us. A thing. You mentioned.”

Audra relaxed a little. “That seems… well… that’s not actually… bad? Is it? I mean, there’s no actual harm in… learning…”

Rosie tried to concentrate, through the pounding headache. “That… rings a bell, I think… how drunk *were* we? But… like you said. No harm in it.”

“No.” “None.” “Perfectly fine.” “Really quite normal.” Prophe and Audra vied to agree with each other. Rosie looked around the room, wondering where her clothes might have got to. This place was startlingly untidy. “Look, I… I should go, right? And nobody else has to know about-”

“Hang on.” Audra was looking worried again. “If you’re there and you’re there… who is holding my leg?”

She flicked up the sheet to her right. A woman lay there, curled on her side, stirring slightly; slim of build; her face and hands deeply tanned, her body striking in its pure white marble paleness…

Audra prodded one milk-white shoulder. “Albie?”

The courier surfaced with a grunt, raised her head and blinked blearily. “Oh, hey, Audra… wow. That must have been quite a night, I feel…” Then she saw Rosie. Her eyes widened, there was a crowded moment of action, and Albie was crouched against the headboard, clutching a pillow defensively over her body. “Oh dear. I. Um. I didn’t expect to see. Er. You. Here.”

Rosie sighed heavily. “I would ask what you’re doing here,” she said as calmly as she could manage, “but I think I get the idea. Is this… is this going to be a problem? For anybody?”

Albie looked down shyly. “Shouldn’t be. I mean… it’s not as if it’s the first time… I mean, with…”

Rosie glanced between Audra and Prophe. They were both blushing again. “All right. That, I confess, surprises me.”

Prophe cleared her throat. “Well… with my wife’s work… we can’t always be together…”

“…and Albie’s always going back and forth between here and Waterdeep, and she’s been such a good friend for so long…” Audra tailed off.

“So, er, sometimes we ask her to deliver… messages. And, er. Gifts. Personal… private. Gifts. Sort of thing.” Prophe fell silent also.

“And I… I don’t remember it very clearly, but I think you were going to teach them a thing… and we thought I should know too, in case, you know, I had to… you know.” Albie buried her face in the pillow she was clutching. “Uuurgh. What in the hells were we *drinking*?”

Rosie shook her head, trying to clear the cobwebs, and immediately regretted it. “Whatever it was, they should call it Diminished Responsibility. Look, I think we should all be able to put this behind us-”

Albie snorted with involuntary laughter, which tailed off into a groan. Rosie glared at her with as much dignity as possible, under the circumstances. “Indeed. Well, since you three seem to know each other so well, and since, after all, it’s just us girls, I think we-”

She broke off. A memory was surfacing, slowly, like a whale in treacle. She looked down, and prodded the bed a couple of times, experimentally.

“It’s… it’s not just us girls, is it.” Nobody replied. “And this isn’t just a really lumpy mattress.” She whipped away the pillow she’d been sleeping on. “What the hell are *you* doing here?”

Seen in his natural environment, his bald head flushed with the heat and exertion of the forge, his moustache magnificent in its lushness and spread, Father Gordon was the epitome of bullet-headed masculinity. Currently, however, on the morning after the night before, he was pale, blotchy, greenish and rumpled. He cleared his throat nervously. “Ah. Um. Good morning… ladies.”

“We shall see. How long have you been awake?”

“…a few minutes,” he admitted. There was a seismic motion as he dragged himself to a sitting position against the headboard, leaving Rosie sitting in the middle of the bed.

“When were you planning to join us?”

“I, er, thought that perhaps I should be discreet. I did not wish to intrude-”

Albie giggled again. Rosie’s knuckles were going white.

Prophe laid a reassuring hand on the halfling’s arm. “Rosie… Gordon is… family. Really family. This doesn’t have to be… a thing.”

“I had thought, Prophe, that you and the good *Father* here were no longer… how shall I put it…”

Prophe and Gordon looked equally sheepish. “Well. Not… not usually. Not… often,” muttered the priest.

Rosie looked over at Audra, who did not seem surprised. “And your view on this?”

Audra coughed bashfully. “Well, it’s not as if it’s anything new… and it’s… not usually the, er, the three of us. Well. Except New Year’s… it’s kind of a tradition…”

Rosie could feel the headache getting worse. She realised that Prophe and Audra had leaned in against Gordon’s muscular shoulders, apparently without noticing. “And do you have any actual information about last night? Remember anything?”

Gordon frowned painfully. “Not a lot… I know Last Stone’s Day went well… and then, after last orders, it was just, er, a few of us… and we were drinking… something… and then you all asked me to, er, join you… and it seemed impolite to, um, refuse… you ladies were very, um, insistent…” He smoothed his moustache instinctively.

Rosie shifted uncomfortably. She had to admit that this was all horribly plausible. “So. Our little circle of trust grows apace. I’m sure we are all very grateful that you were so… gentlemanly, as it were. Now, we should agree what-”

She stopped again. Now that Gordon was no longer doing his mattress impression, the sheets had settled again, and she had a sinking feeling…

She reached over and slapped the most suspicious-looking bulge in the blankets, hard, eliciting a yelp. “All hands on deck.”

Another tousled head emerged indignantly, at the foot of the bed. “You didn’t have to do that!”

Rosie sighed. “So… Grella… it seems you decided to stay in Red Larch after Last Stone’s Day, this time…”

The baker extracted herself gingerly from the tangle of sheets. “Yes… well… you remember we’d, you know, talked a bit yesterday… and when Gordon turned up, I couldn’t resist the chance to get to know him a little better… and then the drinks were going around, and we may have all, um. Got a bit carried away.” She cast a rueful glance at Prophe. “I- I’m really sorry, dear… I, um, I didn’t mean to go too far…”

Prophe raised a hand to stop the apology. “Please don’t trouble yourself, dear. I know full well what an attractive fellow he is, and these days, with Audra… I am thoroughly taken…”

Albie squealed and bit her pillow, shoulders heaving with suppressed giggles.

Rosie closed her eyes and rubbed them hard with her knuckles, then waited for the little glowing spots to go away. “Fine. Congratulations, everybody. Now, what-.”

Somebody under the bed sneezed. Somebody else said “Shhh!” a little too sharply.

Rosie gritted her teeth.

“I can think of two people around here who routinely sleep on the floor,” she said to the empty air, “and I want you both where I can see you, girls.”

There were some scuffling noises. Two elven heads, one with a mass of flowing blond tresses, one dark and scruffy, emerged reluctantly into the light, their faces rising into view over the side of the bed. “Er… good morning, Grandmother. Everybody.”

“Good morning, Walnut. Brahma.”

Brahma nodded curtly.

“Now, I know the two of you are thoroughly… entangled. But I’m surprised to find you *here*. Especially since…” Rosie nodded at Gordon, “…not all the company would be… to your taste, perhaps.”

Walnut and Brahma exchanged glances, and explanations began to emerge, piecemeal. “We didn’t want to miss the, er, party-” “And then, once we’d had a few drinks, we sort of went with the flow-” “So to speak-” “And, er, when you offered an, um, instructional thingy-” “I know I’m not, you know, as… experienced as some-” “But you’re a quick learner, love-” “We thought we should, you know, take the opportunity-” “Some of it’s a bit hazy but I think we enjoyed ourselves-” “So… no harm done, right?” “Right?” They tailed off, hopefully.

Rosie coughed, her throat dry. “I *still* want to know what the *hells* we were drinking last night.”

There was another commotion in the last undisturbed corner of the bed. A hand emerged, waving an empty bottle. “I think I can clear that up for yer, luv.”

Rosie slumped backwards to lie on the bed. She’d had enough of this morning already. From her recumbent viewpoint, she saw a diminutive figure clamber into view – not a halfling, but a man so gnarled and shrunken with age that he could almost have passed for one…

“Hello, Waelvur.”

“’Ullo, Beestinger. Ladies. Gordon. Wot a night, eh? It’d be one to remember, eck-*sept* of course, after a few goes of this stuff…” he tilted the bottle to his lips experimentally, checking for any remaining drops, “rememberin’ stuff can be a little bit of a struggle… Anyway. Good morning to all of yer.”

There was a muttered chorus of greetings. Most of the ladies were blushing. So was Gordon. Rosie looked from one man to the other in disbelief. “Hang on… you two…?”

Gordon’s face and bald pate were entirely crimson now. “Look… it was a… confusing situation… for all of us… anyway, surely you ladies are in no position to cast aspersions…” He grumbled his way to silence.

Rosie turned to Waelvur, no longer able to avoid the hint of a smile. “Got anything to say for yourself, you old reprobate?”

“Younger’n you, darlin’, and don’t you ferget it. I say that yer never too old for new experiences, Rosie. An’ it was you that taught me that, for which I thank yer kindly.” He favoured her with a melodramatic wink.

“*Fine*. So… were you plying us with that vile brew of yours? The stuff that looks like tar and drinks like turpentine?”

“Ah, I see yer remember Wood Stain. Leaves an impression, don’t it? As I recall we started there, ‘cos all those bloody tourists ‘ad drunk the cellar good as dry, an’ rather than ‘ave Prophe go fight the rats and spiders to get to the reserve barrels, I said I’d bring over somethin’ a little stronger than ale. Started there, aye, and then once that’d run out, we got into my new batch. Been workin’ on somethin’ a little special.”

“Dare I ask what the new stuff is called?”

“Shaft Grease. ‘Ave ter say, though, I didn’t expect things to go with quite that much of a swing. Don’t know what got into us all…”

Albie made a strangled noise and fell off the bed.

Rosie, gazing idly upwards, was becoming increasingly suspicious of the way the canopy over the bed was hanging. Ah, well. It wasn’t as if this could actually get any worse. She cupped her hands around her mouth and called: “Anybody up there had better be down here, pronto.”

The reply came, not audible, but as a voice in her head. *There’s nobody here but us chickens. Please pay no attention to the drow behind the curtain.*

Rosie had had more than enough. She raised her hand, and there was an eye-warping moment as shadows bent and flowed from every dark corner, gathering in her grasp, becoming her staff. As she swung it, she growled, deep in her throat, and the weapon flickered, momentarily becoming something midway between a sword and a lance – a long, surgically sharp blade on a flexible shaft. The point carved with millimetric accuracy through the fabric of the canopy, just barely severing a layer of threads.

As the weapon vanished again, Rosie felt a feedback of emotion from it – something like satisfaction. That was a little worrying.

The canopy split, ripping apart along the line of her cut, and two bodies plummeted through it onto the bed below, landing face down on the mattress.

One of them, a tall, lithe, dark-skinned figure, raised a head decorated with many crystalline eyes and greeted the company with a broad and open smile. “Hello, friends! Good morrow to us all.”

The other figure stayed face down, apparently reluctant to face the world. Rosie realised she was staring, hypnotised, at the woman’s lusciously curved buttocks. She blinked a few times and addressed her friend. “K’Thriss… could you introduce us to your… attractive companion here?”

The warlock sat up, apparently unworried by his own or anyone else’s nudity. “Oh, of course. Everyone, this is Trixie. My succubus.”

“Your *what*? You *own* a *succubus*?” No wonder everyone was practically drooling over that magnificent, callipygous posterior… Rosie shook her head again, refusing to be distracted.

“Oh, no. Quite the reverse, in fact. Trixie can explain it better than I can…” He reached over and patted the recumbent woman on the shoulder. “Don’t be shy, dear.”

“This is all my fault. This is all my gods-damned fault.” The stranger rose to all fours – Prophe and Gordon, getting the full rear view, both made a sort of high-pitched keening noise, like steam escaping from a kettle – then sat cross-legged, shoulders slumped in dejection. Her bosom was even more ridiculously curvaceous than her behind. Her face would have been terrifyingly beautiful, but for her expression – tense, morose, and scowling. “This entire situation is FUBAR. Kill me now, why don’t you.”

“Don’t tempt me.” Rosie gritted her teeth and tried not to think about plunging face-first into that magnificent cleavage. “I need you to turn down the… all this… and I need you to explain the situation very clearly. Now.”

“I can’t make it go all the way away, but…” Trixie waved a hand in a tired gesture, and her body shimmered for a moment, glamours fading. She was still, clearly, the very incarnation of lust, but if you concentrated on the horns and scales and fangs, it was easier to ignore the curves. “Look, it’s… it’s complicated, okay? Thriss and I have a *long-standing* association which I literally *cannot* tell you about in detail because it is a matter of such *highly classified intelligence* that even *he* isn’t allowed to know about it when I’m not here. In fact, it shouldn’t even have been *possible* for me to arrive here in company, this is an *utter* Charlie Foxtrot, they must have broken something in the last update and of course they *never* test it properly, they just push it into the field and tell us to file a bloody *bug report*, hah, as if sending in a blue 105-B is going to fix this sodding *real-time mission-critical failure*…”

Rosie raised a hand. “Traditionally… Trixie?... an explanation involves actually *explaining something*. Try harder.”

“Okay. Okay. Gah. I’m supposed to meet him *alone*, and instead I turn up in the middle of this pastry-themed Bacchanalia you people are throwing, I have no *plan* for this so I do my best to blend in, and I may have had a drink of… something… and…” Trixie put her head in her hands. “Look, I have all the wrong instincts for this, okay? I’m a *succubus*. I have an… effect on people. I can’t help it.”

She looked up again, focussing on Rosie, with a plaintive expression in her face and voice. “Please, you have to understand, it wasn’t intentional… and, you know, technically, I’m just a *temptress*, I can’t actually *make* you do anything you wouldn’t plausibly choose to do yourself, and, heh, let’s be honest, none of you needed *that* much of a nudge to start licking the creamy juices off each other’s-”

She looked at the expressions of her audience.

“…I’m not helping, am I?”

Rosie shook her head slowly.

“…sod it. Look, believe me, whatever problems *you lot* have now, mine are *worse*. This is a *deep cover* assignment, and none of you moose-humping perverts are supposed to-”

“*What* did you call us? I have *never*-”

Trixie flapped a hand dismissively. “Moose, elk, whatever…”

Walnut said “No…” very quietly and slumped face-first onto the blankets. Brahma, a thousand-yard stare in her eyes, reached over to scratch behind her ears in an automatic gesture of comfort.

“…none of you is supposed to know that I exist. If this gets back to head office… I am one hundred percent for the high jump. You can’t *imagine* what… I am going to be fucked *sideways*, and I don’t mean in the good way. They’re going to give me to the lemures to practice on. They’re going to make all my dreams come true. They’re going to *verb* me right in the *noun* with an *adverb adjective noun*, and you don’t even *have* those. I’m *doomed*. Oh, and Squidly MacDiddly might get to eat your entire world, so, you know… you too.”

Rosie folded her arms and regarded the interloper sternly. “So. Now we’ve established that. What exactly are you going to do about it?”

Trixie folded up, head on her knees, hands over her head. “I don’t know,” she muttered. “Usually when this sort of thing happens, there’s no need for cleanup because I just drag everyone to hell afterwards. I don’t suppose you’d all be amenable to… no? No. Didn’t think so. Don’t look at me like that. There are no bad ideas in… Okay.”

Rosie drummed her fingers nervously. Even in her extremely extensive experience, this was a novel situation. “Leaving aside the various diabolical and cosmic consequences… this is going to be rather awkward, socially speaking. It’s not as if we can all just forget that this ever happened…”

Trixie perked up. “Of course! That’s it! I totes have a solution for this!” She reached into the air, and her arm disappeared to the elbow into a shimmering void. She bit her lip and seemed to be rummaging for something. “You know how what you want is always at the bottom of your handbag? Gissa second… hah!” Her hand emerged into reality, clutching a couple of objects – a pair of very dark spectacles, and a small, silvery wand. “Emergency Dysmnemonic Protocol Delta Zero Fnord! I *knew* this would come in handy one day!”

Rosie peered at the wand suspiciously. “You’ll have to tell us what that means.”

“It means,” said Trixie cheerfully, donning the dark glasses and smiling a grin full of fangs, “everybody watch the birdie!” There was a blinding flash of red light from the tip of the wand.

Rosie felt suddenly much calmer, and deeply fascinated by whatever the nice lady was going to say.

“Okay. Uh. Dammit, I should think of this stuff first. Er. Listen, everybody: nothing untoward happened last night. You, er, you had a very successful Tony’s Day or whatever, then you had a party to celebrate, and, er, you… you whiled away the evening with tasteful cocktails, light conversation, and some spirited, good-humoured parlour games… then everybody snuggled in socially acceptable combinations and, er… you all slept well and none of this seems at all odd to you. Also I was never here and you don’t know me, no names no pack drill, *capisce*?. Three, two, one, and Trixie *out*.” There was another flash, this time golden, and the woman who hadn’t been there wasn’t there.

Rosie yawned and stretched. “Morning, all. Who’s for coffee?... oh, hey girls. You seen my robe under there? Thanks. I’ll get a kettle on.” She pottered off towards the bar and kitchen.

//

Prophe returned from the cellars, carrying a barrel under each arm. Setting them into the racks, she stretched luxuriously. *So* lovely that Audra could drop by for the holiday. Shame they hadn’t been able to do more than cuddle, but… she felt herself smile… sometimes just being close to the one you love can be quite as satisfying as… ahhhh.

Very satisfying indeed.

//

Audra and Albie shared a cart on the road south towards Waterdeep. It took them a little longer than usual to get there, because they had to pull off the road several times to take care of some personal, private matters.

//

Grella carefully spooned the filling into the piping bag, attached the nozzle, and gave it an experimental squeeze. A torrent of thick, rich, white cream poured from the tip, and…

She leaned against the counter, breathing deeply, until the dizziness passed. Good lord. This was becoming intolerable.

She shook her head and returned her attention to the tray of fresh profiteroles. Carefully now, carefully…

In a matter of minutes, her work was done. She gazed proudly at the tray as she set it in her shop window. Perfection! Warm, plump, well-rounded balls, coated in chocolate and full to bursting with creamy goodness…

She bit her knuckle, and heard herself whine quietly. She was sweating.

Pull yourself together, she scolded herself. You’re a grown woman, Grella Pretter. Grow a spine. Go south and talk to the man. It can’t hurt.

You could…

She felt herself blush.

You could even take *scones*.

//

Brahma opened her eyes again and watched the ceiling rotate gently overhead for a little while. “I… wow. Just… *wow*. How did… where did you learn *that*?”

“I… do you know, I don’t know?” Walnut flexed her cramped fingers carefully. “I think it just… came to me.”

“So did *I*, sweetie, so did *I*.” She stretched cautiously and sat up in the bed. “Yeesh. We need to remember the towels next time. Or a mop. Anyway… do you think we could maybe get some fresh air? It’s, er, a little close, in here.”

“I guess we could take a walk in the woods. But remember, you have to be very closely supervised. You’re in my custody, you know. It’s *documented*.”

“That’s probably a good thing. I’ve heard that the woods can be very dangerous for a girl on her own.”  Brahma lowered her voice. “They *say* that an elven maiden might be *hunted down* and *devoured* there by the most *terrifying* of predators. A *savage, rough* and * hirsute beast* of truly *insatiable* appetite who *hungers* for the *tender flesh* of *women*.”

“Really? We’ll have to watch out for any of those. Oh- Brahma?”

“Yes?”

“Bring your lute.”

Associated MGT Tuning Help Hey all I need some help.  First a bit of the story.

Two years ago I started rebuilding my nitro RC collection.  A couple of T-Maxx's, a sweet racing Revo, a Savage, and others in the mix but my favorite is my MGT.  I bashed the hell out of the truck and it showed so after trips to my local shop, Amazon, and Craigslist I gathered enough parts to start my grand plans.  My workbench changed into Dr. Frankenstein's operating table and the end result was glorious.  I saved my favorite for last since it was the one with the most extensive modifications.

But life happens and I had to delay the rebirth of my favorite monster until recently.  So new bottle of nitro and a charged igniter, and some lightning, I proceed to bring her to life.  Everything was going great, I had a good consistent idle from the .50 AE Pro that was now the heart of my monster and the camber/caster/toe adjustments were all spot on.  Warmed up to temp with 1/2 tank and I launched.  What happened next deflated my day.

No power, none, opening the throttle just left with nothing but a bit of smoke and a waaaaa .....

Ok no big deal let's start adjusting.  Bogging down at WOT means not enough fuel right?  Not in this case ...

Now the factory specs were applied, a bit richer, on the bench.  3 1/2 turns on the HS, 1/2 turn out from flush on the mix, and 5 on the LS.  I readjusted the LS and the Mix on the bench right after warm up to get a good idle but I didn't touch the HS until the first run.  No adjustment to the HS had any or minor effect.  So my conclusion is I did something wrong, not gonna lie there were beers involved in the construction, so back to the bench she goes.

I tore out the engine, fuel lines, and gas tank.  Note all of these were either replaced or cleaned but the .50 internals were not replaced.  I tested it before assembly and it had good compression and clear fuel (WD-40) flow before I buttoned it all up.  Of course a fresh glow plug was installed so my investigation started with the tank and lines.  With the taste of nitro in my mouth I concluded that my blow test for leaks and flow passed.  No issues there I turned to the carb.

What is this?  The o-ring at the carb base is missing?  Ok lets get that taken care of.  I also pulled all of the needles from the carb, again, and inspected the o-rings.  Now surely she will run ..... eh, no.

At this point I am stumped, I don't know what to do.  Help a brother out please!

(Spoilers All) Wot Junkie Presents: Chapter 5 of the Eye of the World **Tam nodded but did not stop. When he had made a complete circuit of the house, he did the same around the barn and the sheep pen, still studying the ground. He even checked the smokehouse and the curing shed. Drawing a bucket of water from the well, he filled a cupped hand, sniffed the water, and gingerly touched it with the tip of his tongue. Abruptly he barked a laugh, then drank it down in a quick gulp.**


Here's Tam getting back into soldier mode and making sure that everything is alright and then he laughs at himself for being silly because this is the Two Rivers and nothing bad happens .


**Not everything had been planted, of course; only part, in hopes the cold might break in time to make a crop of some kind before the cellar was empty. It did not take long to finish hoeing, which would have suited him just fine in years past, but now he wondered what they would do if nothing came up this year.**

It's almost as if *Something* is playing around with the weather trying to starve people but that's just silly right?

**The shelf of books by the door was not nearly as long as the one at the Winespring Inn, but books were hard to come by. Few peddlers carried more than a handful, and those had to be stretched out among everyone who wanted them.**

One of the many many ( no this is not a typo) things I like about the Wheel of Times series is the high inworld literacy rate.

**Tam rooted around in a cabinet and came up with a key as long as his hand. He twisted it in the big iron lock on the door. At Rand’s questioning look he said, “Best to be safe. Maybe I’m taking a fancy, or maybe the weather is blacking my mood, but. . . .” He sighed and bounced the key on his palm. “I’ll see to the back door,” he said, and disappeared toward the back of the house.**

**Rand could not remember either door ever being locked. No one in the Two Rivers locked doors. There was no need. Until now, at least.**

The people in Two Rivers never locked their doors and for the life of me I just can't imagine that and I just live in a suburban area but since I was a kid we always made sure that the doors and windows were locked.

**When Tam came back, Rand stared in surprise. A thick belt slanted around Tam’s waist, and from the belt hung a sword, with bronze heron on the black scabbard and another on the long hilt.**


**Slowly Tam drew the weapon; firelight played along the gleaming length. It was nothing at all like the plain, rough blades Rand had seen in the hands of merchants’ guards. No gems or gold adorned it, but it seemed grand to him, nonetheless.**

 **The blade, very slightly curved and sharp on only one edge, bore another heron etched into the steel. Short quillons, worked to look like braid, flanked the hilt. It seemed almost fragile compared with the swords of the merchants’ guards; most of those were double-edged, and thick enough to chop down a tree.**

Say hello to a One Power wrought General's sword from the Age of Legends worth a king's ransom.

**“I got it a long time ago,” Tam said, “a long way from here. And I paid entirely too much; two coppers is too much for one of these.**

By the way for god's sake Tam did not kill Laman to get that sword or kill Laman with that sword; I've seen both theorized and they're wrong because an Aiel did the deed.

**Tam snorted. “Not much use in herding sheep, now is it? Can’t plow a field or harvest a crop with it.” For a long minute he stared at the sword as if wondering what he was doing with such a thing. At last he let out a heavy sigh.**

That's why the Aiel will use any weapon except a sword because it could only be used to kill and had no other purpose.

“**But if I am not just taken by a black fancy, if our luck runs sour, maybe in the next few days we’ll be glad I tucked it in that old chest, instead.”
He slid the sword smoothly back into its sheath and wiped his hand on his shirt with a grimace. “The stew should be ready. I’ll dish it out while you fix the tea.”**

I'm glad that they're finally going to eat because they've had a busy day and only ate honeycakes.

**The creature roared, part scream of pain, part animal snarl, as boiling water splashed over its face. Even as the kettle struck, Tam’s sword flashed. The roar abruptly became a gurgle, and the huge shape toppled back. Before it finished falling, another was trying to claw its way past. Rand glimpsed a misshapen head topped by spike-like horns before Tam struck again, and two huge bodies blocked the door. He realized his father was shouting at him.**

**“Run, lad! Hide in the woods!” The bodies in the doorway jerked as others outside tried to pull them clear. Tam thrust a shoulder under the massive table; with a grunt he heaved it over atop the tangle. “There are too many to hold! Out the back! Go! Go! I’ll follow!”**

**Suddenly one of the windows burst outward in a shower of glass and wood** **as Tam leaped through it, sword still in hand. He landed on his feet, but instead of running away from the house he dashed toward the back of it, ignoring the monstrous things scrambling after him through the broken window and the doorway**

Tamdril al'Thor is still one deadly bastard even after almost 20 years of living a peaceful life.


**“But I had to make sure you didn’t speak out. Some Trollocs can hear like a dog. Maybe better.”**

**“But Trollocs are just. . . .” Rand let the words trail off. Not just a story, not after tonight. Those things could be Trollocs or the Dark One himself for all he knew. “Are you sure?” he whispered. “I mean . . . Trollocs?”**

**“I’m sure. Though what brought them to the Two Rivers. . . . I never saw one before tonight, but I’ve talked with men who have, so I know a little. Maybe enough to keep us alive.**

**Listen closely. A Trolloc can see better than a man in the dark, but bright lights blind them, for a time at least. That may be the only reason we got away from so many. Some can track by scent or sound, but they’re said to be lazy. If we can keep out of their hands long enough, they should give up.”**

Our first infodump and it's not clunky or anything  and that's one of the things about Robert Jordan as an author.

**At the front of the house he lay close beside the wall, beneath the broken window, and listened. The dull thudding of blood in his ears was the loudest sound he heard. Slowly he reared up and peered inside.
The stewpot lay upside down in the ashes on the hearth. Splintered, broken wood littered the room; not a single piece of furniture remained whole.**

**Even the table rested at an angle, two legs hacked to rough stubs. Every drawer had been pulled out and smashed; every cupboard and cabinet stood open, many doors hanging by one hinge. Their contents were strewn over the wreckage, and everything was dusted with white. Flour and salt, to judge from the slashed sacks tossed down by the fireplace.**

**He ran in through the front door and stopped, gagging at the stench. A stable that had not been mucked out in months was the only thing he could think of that might come close to matching it. Vile smears defiled the walls. Trying to breathe through his mouth, he hurriedly began poking through the mess on the floor. There had been a waterbag in one of the cupboards.**


Trollocs are some of the vilest creatures in all of fantasy and off hand I can't think of any race as bad.


**A scraping sound behind him sent a chill to his marrow, and he spun, almost falling over the remains of the table. He caught himself, and moaned behind teeth that would have chattered had he not had them clenched until his jaw ached.**

**One of the Trollocs was getting to its feet. A wolf’s muzzle jutted out below sunken eyes. Flat, emotionless eyes, and all too human. Hairy, pointed ears twitched incessantly**

As a WoT reading veteran I can't believe that this is the same Rand who later could vaporize hundreds of thousands of Trollocs with relative ease.

**It muttered something, guttural and sharp, then said, “Others go away. Narg stay. Narg smart.” The words were distorted and hard to understand, coming from a mouth never meant for human speech. Its tone was meant to be soothing, he thought, but he could not take his eyes off the stained teeth, long and sharp, that flashed every time the creature spoke. “Narg know some come back sometime. Narg wait. You no need sword. Put sword down.”**


Ladies and gentlemen bear witness to the first and last time we ever hear a Trolloc speak in the whole series.

**Abruptly the Trolloc spasmed and was still. Battered and bruised, half suffocated by the bulk on top of him, for a moment Rand could only lie there in disbelief. Quickly he came to his senses, though, enough to writhe out from under the body, at least. And body it was. The bloodied blade of Tam’s sword stood out from the center of the Trolloc’s back.**

Congratulations on your first kill even if it was somewhat accidental, Rand al'Thor Dragon Reborn.

Anyone up for bearing failure analysis? Just pulled from a 1993 Accord, 2.2 liter 4-cylinder (F22A1). Mileage unknown (probably around 170K), car has a history of neglect, abuse, and significant repeated overheating caused by intermittently-failing head gasket. Additionally this engine had a history (roughly 30K miles ago) of low oil pressure caused by the oilpan being smashed up into the pickup tube. Engine was making knocking sound between 2K RPM and 4K RPM under light to medium loads. No knocking at idle nor heard at WOT. Engine has good even compression all cylinders. Oil pressure is low at idle once engine is fully heat-soaked. Main bearing #3 had spun several degrees out of alignment, but strangely enough looked better than any other. Conrod big-end bearings were in considerably better shape than the mains, but pictures are not yet available for all of them. Oil was black and contained flakes of bearing material, none bigger than 3x3mm.

Given the vehicle history I'm hoping a bearing replacement is good enough to get another year or two of service from the current engine, which will equate to something around 25k miles. I think the low oil pressure was caused by the spun bearing (oiling hole was completely occluded) compounded by the overly-large gap between bearings and journals. I think the primary cause of damage to the bearings was overheating. Thoughts?

Engine leash with the 8 speed auto Hey there, just got my engine leash in the mail earlier today and wanted to give a quick review before the busy weekend starts.

Car: 2013 BK2 3.8 Track with 8 Speed Auto @ 97k miles

Pics: [close](https://i.imgur.com/LsXj8u9.jpg) and [engine bay](https://i.imgur.com/cWGp5hs.jpg) and the [actual car](https://i.imgur.com/RLn8NTP.jpg)

Installation - About as easy as it can get. I didn't have a wrench handy so used some pliers to screw the nut of the loop, but had socket wrenches and they easily removed and put back on the nuts on the strut bar

First 5 minutes - As soon as I shifted into gear, I notice it was a but smoother. As the engine warmed up, shifts were quick and a lot smoother. As some of you may know, the 2013 didn't get the rev matching. The engine didn't go up as high in the RMPs when it shifted as well.

After warmed up - first thing I did was go WOT unto the highway on ramp, shifts were maybe a little quicker, but noticeably smoother and less dramatic. Here is where I notice the big difference of it not shifting as hard.

If you have a bk2 with a 3.8l, I would look into this as it definitely helps the drive line be less sloppy and get the power down better after shifting

Update on the 07 Envoy Trans troubles. Ok I bought it, cold its starts out just fine, shifts smooth under normal and WOT acceleration. Turn off the Traction Control it will spin the tires.

So not clutches. At least I don't think so.

Drove it around 6 miles, slowed down to make a right turn and boom, Nothing. Pulled over, shut it off, waited a minute. Restarted and it drops in gear. Won't shift, will accelerate to about 35MPH then drops out again. Never comes out of first.

accelerate to 35, dump it in neutral shut it off restart it and drop it in drive and grabs second.

Currently waiting for it to cool down and see what it does. I'm pretty confident once it cools off it will work again.

No CEL, currently looking for my OBDI dongle to see if it has any codes stored.

I'm thinking bad solenoid or faulty internal wiring harness at this point

The truth about Asaris and Lexi in Andromeda...  Just a short theory fanfic i wrote awhile back.

WOT... Read at your own risk!

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dr. Lexi T'Perro darted her eyes back to her datapad as Sara Ryder sauntered out of the medbay. She has finally recovered enough from her injuries to be allowed discharge, after her previous disastrous encounter with the Kett. Sara was carried onto the Tempest on a stretcher, and had spent an entire day unconscious while Lexi examined her injuries and patched her up with medigel.

Lexi rushed to check out Ryder's injuries upon learning of it, and quickly fixed up her broken jaw with some surgery. She carefully patched up a few deep gashes in the Pathfinder's left calf with medigel, where the wraith had sunk its claws. At this rate she is getting herself injured, we are going to run out of medigel soon, Lexi thought. I'll need to discuss with her about her recklessness in combat when she's awake.

Sara had smirked when she finally regained conscious in the medbay. She grumbled about the thick bandages that Lexi had swathed her in. "Doc, I look like a walking Christmas present," she joked. The Pathfinder then proclaimed that she was feeling fine, and insisted on being discharged. "Tell me how you got injured like this," Lexi pressed. Sara looked confused. "I was trying to free my left leg from a wraith, then…"she trailed off. After staring into space for a moment, Ryder shook her head sheepishly, "Sorry doc, I simply cannot remember anything after that. Then I woke up and find myself all wrapped up by you." As Ryder finished her sentence, she began smirking impishly again.

Lexi's forehead crinkled and ignored the Pathfinder's obvious attempt to flirt with her. Sara's physical injuries would heal just fine, her handiwork ensured that. What worried her was that Sara could not remember any details about how she got injured. Repeated questioning brought no further results, and Ryder seems to be getting more fidgety by the minute. Seeing that Ryder was unwilling to lie down on the bed properly and insisting that she should be up and about, Lexi gave the Pathfinder a shot of sedative to put her to sleep while she figured out what happened during the battle by talking to Peebee and Jaal.

Lexi decided to start with Peebee. She had to keep knocking loudly for several minutes before finally hearing shuffling footsteps from the other side of the door of the escape pod room. Peebee gave her an extremely annoyed look when she finally opened the door. "What do you want?!"

Lexi tried to remain calm and asked about what happen to Ryder, but Peebee refused to respond to her questions. Instead, Peebee slammed the door of the escape pod room in her face, and yelled at her to bugger off with threats to use Poc to zap the ends of her crest. Lexi could almost swore to herself that she heard sniffing from behind the door as she stormed off, shaking her head at Peebee's antics. Immature as usual, Lexi thought. Wonder what Ryder actually sees in her. Lexi quickened her pace to look for Jaal in the common room.

Jaal was hesitant to divulge about what happened to Ryder at first, knowing that the good doctor sometimes tries too hard controlling Ryder's health, from giving her advice on yoga poses to dietary recommendations. Ryder had complained to him and Peebee about the doctor's nagging emails while driving around in the Nomad more than once.

"The Pathfinder could have sustained serious brain damage. If you don't want to be responsible for having a hand in causing permanent disability to her, I strongly suggest you tell me what actually happened during the fight, right now," Lexi warned in a threatening tone. Jaal threw his hands up, and revealed that Sara had been mauled in the calf by a wraith, then slammed face-first into the ground by a fiend while trying to free herself from the wraith, due to failing to use her jump jets to avoid the fiend's massive paw in time. She was knocked out instantly, and it took him luring the fiend as bait and Peebee furiously firing her pistol at the fiend for almost five minutes before they managed to take it out. Lexi chided them for failing to properly protect the Pathfinder, and that it had resulted in Ryder having a broken jaw, a concussion, and being knocked out cold while Peebee radioed the Tempest for an evacuation. Due to their carelessness, Kallo had to do an emergency landing to allow Peebee and Jaal to carry the unconscious Pathfinder back on board. Jaal shook his head ruefully at the news.

Lexi was pacing back and forth in the medbay repeatedly. She considered melding with the Pathfinder to check if there were any serious holes in her memories, but quickly decided against it. It's probably… not professional for me to do that, a voice in Lexi's head whispered quietly. As much as she wanted to get close, she was afraid of harming the Pathfinder, afraid of history repeating itself. "Don't get too close, Lexi T'Perro," she berated herself. She considered finding Peebee, but that self-centred lass probably would not help, as she is too busy with her own projects. After deliberating for a while, Lexi decided to get the AI to check out Ryder's brain functions. As much as she distrusted the AI, perhaps it could be useful in situations like this, seeing how it can manipulate the human Pathfinder's vital signs. "Sam? Could you please check the Pathfinder's neurological system for any signs of damage?"

Sam detected that Ryder's concussion was not serious, and she was fit enough to be discharged the next day. Lexi spent the night watching over the sleeping Pathfinder. As Ryder exited the medbay the next day, Lexi stared hard at her datapad, reminding herself of all the reasons she have to stay away from Ryder. She is young, impulsive, smirks too much, naïve and too trusting. But she is also kind, responsible, carries herself well, tries her best to help everyone, and… pretty. Stop harbouring thoughts about the Pathfinder, Lexi, she scolded herself again.

As Lexi continued staring at her datapad, her thoughts drifted back to the time she was back at the Milky Way, on Omega. Her father was regularly injured while working in his job, and she quickly learnt to patch him up, which eventually led her being a doctor. But her real interest was in alien anatomy, and she spent her university years learning about known alien species, including a few dissections. Her work led her to become an authority on alien anatomy among her peers, and she earned a reputation for helping out the hospital in Omega for treating patients of various species.

However, her Turian father was a bouncer, and her mother was a housewife, which means they did not have much to live on, let alone pay for her university fees. Despite holding down a hospital job after she graduated, Lexi struggled to pay off her student loans due to the steep interest rates it carried, as she had borrowed credits illegally from various loan sharks to pay her school fees. Desperate to pay off her debts to allow her aging father to retire, she dived into research to create a product that would sell well in the black market.

After countless nights of painstaking research, she managed to come up with a facial gel that would enhance the beauty of her own race, from notes she gathered in her old university days about Asari anatomy, and various ingredients from the Extranet. It involved some complicated gene modification ingredients that allowed an Asari to make her face prettier by Asari standards, and with Lexi's knowledge of Asari anatomy, she managed to put together the gel, dubbed "Azure Facial Gel". Lexi knew that the maiden dancers in Omega bars would gladly pay a good price for one of these gels, which would allow them to attract more customers to watch them perform and tip, and in turn, earn more credits.

Lexi first tested the gel on herself, and saw that it had an effect on her, giving her face a smoother complexion, and caused the scales on her face to dry out much less. This caused less peeling, and she thought it would be a good selling point as well. She sent some vials of the gel to a few friends who were willing to test it out, and received nothing but good reviews. With the incentive of free gel and the help of a few of her university friends, she managed to gather a sizable interest in her facial gel before she launched it in the black market.

On the first day when Azure Facial Gel "unofficially" launched on the black market, it was a hit. The gel was quickly sold out, due to the overwhelmingly positive testimonies from her friends. As more Asaris bought the gel and benefitted from the effects, word of mouth soon spread like wildfire and Lexi managed to build a base of loyal customers. The gel even got orders from the Asari homeworld of Thessia and several Asari colony planets, and Lexi heard that even the famed Commando Sarissa Theris was using her facial gel. Credits quickly rolled in and Lexi managed to pay off all of her student loans and allowed her father to retire from his physically demanding job.

However, six months later, Lexi woke up to continuous beeping from her omnitool. To her shock, she saw a flood of emails from her friends demanding an explanation and threatening to sue her for what she did to them. Confused, Lexi read through the emails, all of which complained that they had been afflicted with genetic damage due to the usage of her Azure Facial Gel, and demanding that she came down to help them reverse the effects immediately. Setting up a meeting point on her warehouse on Omega, Lexi quickly scanned through her blueprint and notes related to the gel, and decided that she could not find the problem in them. She needed to see them in person before she could diagnose what happened to them, since she did not feel any adverse effects from using the gel herself.

When her friends finally gathered at the warehouse a few hours later, Lexi was shocked to see that all her friends had the same face as her. Her eyes, her face shape, her nose, and her lips. There were some initial confusion as to who the real Lexi T'Perro was, but they eventually managed to sort it out. Her friends demanded an explanation from her and threatened to sue her and throw her in Asari prison for the rest of her life.

Horrified, Lexi quickly began to attempt to figure where she had gone wrong. She figured that it must had something to do with her genes. Promising a cure within a month, Lexi rushed back to her apartment to try to synthesize a cure quickly. Her friends had used her gel as her experimental users, after she assured them that it would work as intended and not have any side effects. They were the first few users of the gel, and Lexi felt a chill go down her spine as she counted the number of customers she had, and how much the usage of Azure Facial Gel had spread. Within two months, she would have hordes of angry Asari customers from every planet demanding her blood.

She had used her own genes to build a base to test for the genetic modification part of the ingredients during the creation of the gel, and removed her gene testing base from the final product. Checking through all the ingredients of the gel multiple times, she could not figure how she could have caused the gel to react with a gene that she had removed from the commercial version of the gel. Frustrated, Lexi got onto the medical section of the Extranet to search for any potential culprits in her ingredients.

"Lilacberry leaf essence…" Lexi muttered to herself exhaustedly. She had spent the last three days researching on every single ingredient in her facial gel. Dozing off, a loud video ad began to blast at full volume as Lexi's head hit the volume button, accidently unmuting her terminal. Jumping up in shock, Lexi rubbed her bloodshot eyes and forced herself to continue reading through the description of the plant. She had went through most of the main Extranet sites, but none had any information regarding a problem with gene manipulation with the any of the ingredients. She was searching through the more obscure sites for any information that could be helpful.

A description of the plant she was reading about caught her eye. The rare Lilacberry plant is native to the Asari homeworld of Thessia. The leaves of this plant are traditionally used to create facial masks as it has an effect of moisturizing the skin. According to the Asari geneticist Benezia T'Soni, the Lilacberry leaf, when mixed with Gooseroot Puffball spores, has a rare chance of absorbing genetic information of an Asari. The spores of the mutated Gooseroot Puffball would rapidly affect all other Gooseroot Puffball fungi. It is recommended to destroy all the affected speciments of the fungi to prevent any unwanted side effects.

Lexi was horrified by what she read. In order to save costs for creating the facial gel, she had bought a small specimen of both the Lilacberry plant seeds and Gooseroot Puffball spores, and grew them in her laboratory where she experimented on and created the gel. The Gooseroot Puffball spores she used during the initial testing must have spread airborne and contaminated the rest of the fungi she was growing. Seeing that there was no known cure for this condition, Lexi decided to fly to Thessia to the House of T'Soni to try to find Benezia T'Soni, and enlist her help in getting a cure for her accident.

Due to the long list of appointments Matriarch Benezia has with her associates, Lexi had to wait almost two weeks before having a chance to meet the Matriarch herself. She was invited to the guest room of a huge mansion, and tea was prepared while she tried to explain the situation to the Matriarch.

"My dear child, I have stopped being a geneticist for hundreds of years. I probably would not be able to catch up on all the latest advancements in genetic manipulation and therapy in the recent years, given how much has changed since then. My daughter Liara has set her heart on digging ruins, and she does not know anything about genetic studies. I am afraid I cannot be of much help. However, you are welcome to stay in my library and go through all my old notes on my studies, if it would help you."

Lexi thanked the Matriarch for her help, and spent the next month in the T'Soni library, pouring through all the research notes the former geneticist kept from centuries back. However, there seemed to be no sign of a solution for her problem. She was getting afraid of picking up calls from her omnitool as days dragged by into weeks, and ended up avoiding all incoming calls entirely. Worried that her family might get into trouble because of her, she decided to return to Omega.

When her ship docked on Omega after her month long hiatus, Lexi was greeted by thugs who were obviously waiting for her. "Dr. Lexi T'Perro? The Omega wishes to speak to you," a Batarian growled at her in a low voice. Lexi was terrified, but she decided to follow them anyway to see what Aria T'Loak wanted from her.

The Omega had a scowl on her face as she watched her subordinates approach with the terrified-looking doctor. She motioned for Lexi to sit down on her couch, and drew closer towards Lexi. Lexi held her breath.

"T'Perro? I heard you have been selling some Azure Facial Gel on my turf recently, and caused serious genetic damage to the face of some of my best dancers and warriors. Your actions are costing me my business. How do you intend to pay for that?"

Lexi did not dare to breathe the air out of her lungs. "I don't know… ", she started. Aria cocked her head back, and crossed her arms, "Luckily for you, I have secured compensation of credits for your action from a kind donor with the initials BT. Councillor Tevos came to plead for mercy for you as well, so I'll let you side this time. I want you to disappear from Omega by tomorrow. Just remember you owe me, Lexi."

Lexi breathed a sigh of relief as she scurried out of Afterlife. Packing her belongings and begging her parents to come with her, they boarded a ship to Tamaris, where she remained for the next fifty odd years, trying to find a cure for her facial gel.

That was, until, Aria summoned her back to Omega. Using the campaign slogan of "New Galaxy New Cure" to entice the Asaris, she was forcibly signed up for the Andromeda Initiative along with all the Asaris she had afflicted with the facial genetic disorder. They were sent packing to explore a new system outside the Milky Way, courtesy of Tevos. Lexi was thrilled, and was grateful for the opportunity to return from her exile…

Snapping back to reality, Lexi turned off the display of her datapad. Perhaps Peebee was right in stating that she looks at people like they are experiment subjects. Even though she cared for Ryder more than she would like to admit, she wouldn't risk hurting the Pathfinder.

Next time we dock on the Nexus, I could really use a drink. Or a bottle, or two. Lexi thought as she turned her attention onto the survey she had put together to evaluate crew members' mental wellbeing.

2015 gti 6spd s low rpm Hey guys, wondering if anyone else is experiencing this on their car

My car is bone stock, bought it in Feb from a very dealer as cpo. When I'm driving around town just cruising at around 2k at 40-45mph i noticed that it "struggles" for lack of a better word; feels like stalling out almost or like not enough fuel (maybe bad injector?).I have no issues at wot or if I keep the revs higher. I usually cruise on 5th at around 2k.

Any feedback is appreciated.

16t front sprocket... DO IT. I have ridden with a 14-45 set up for around 8k miles now and I just decided to upgrade to 16-45, and let me tell you for highway, and just all around, this is the best thing I've done with my sv thus far. I bought the bike with the 14-45 setup. I know stock is 15t front on both the naked and faired. With a 14t front sprocket I could instantly bring the wheel up in first and 2nd gear just by wot anywhere over 5k rpm, it was truly a hooligans machine, ate through gears like nobodies business, constantly shifting. Now with this 16t from sprocket I feel much more tame, and "mature". I can cruise around town without shifting every 3 seconds. Gears last MUCH longer and I haven't noticed too much in the way of acceleration loss. Obviously it doesn't get up to speed as quick as it used to, but it's really close. Also added probably 10-15 mph to my top end, haven't tested yet, but I topped out at 125 indicated with the 14t sprocket. Sorry for the rant I just came back from riding after the swap and I am super pleased, figured I'd share the news for anyone else who has been contemplating the swap.

2000 SV650 - Cleaned/Sync’d Carbs - Feels gutless now.... I posted awhile back because my bike was getting horrible gas mileage (~20mpg). I decided to clean and sync the carbs as I couldn’t find any leaks or issues with the fuel delivery system. The carbs were surprisingly stock on the inside, and really clean to boot. I noticed that the pilot screws seemed way out, like 5-6 turns out, as opposed to the normal 3. After re-assembly and cleaning, replacing all the gaskets, and retuning the pilot screws the bike gets much better mpg. The bike now seems to hunt while idling a bit (50-100rpm), which I’m not too concerned with. The notable difference is the bike just doesn’t seem to pull at all anymore through 7-9k rpm. Before at WOT, it felt like an animal, whereas now it hits about 50mph and just doesn’t go anywhere...

Took my GLI to stage 1 - misfires under WOT? I recently bought a 2012 GLI with 37k miles on it. Very well maintained. Took it to get an APR stage 1. As I got on the throttle afterwards, the car was getting super jerky and the check engine light started flashing. I suspected misfires, which were confirmed by a scan reader. I also have an underboost code. Any time I give the car significant throttle, it jerks bad and misfires and the CEL keeps flashing. Could this be that my coils and plugs can’t handle the tune?  Do they need replacement?

Any idea why I'm getting such bad gas mileage in my Eco? The little screen between the gauges says I'm averaging 17.6 MPG... yikes. I don't drive aggressively all that often. I'll do a WOT pull maybe once a week, but that's it. The car is a performance pack and a manual, but it's not like I'm shifting at 4k rpms. First gear is really damn short, so by the time I shift into 2nd the rpms are at ~3k, and if I'm turning, it may go up to 3.5k; I don't like shifting while simultaneously turning. But other than the 1st to 2nd shift, I always shift right at about 2.5k. 99% of my driving is city driving, but I still don't think my MPG should be that bad. It's not like a live in a huge city with horrible traffic anyway. Am I doing something wrong?

Just bought a misfiring Mini Hey guys,

New to the Mini community. Two days ago, I bought a 2009 Clubman S with the 1.6 turbo motor. So far the car has been an absolutely wonderful experience, except for one small problem: the engine misfires at wide open throttle.

Unlike some other posts I've read, my car idles fine. It's just WOT that makes it sputter and not move

I have replaced my battery (was dead) and ignition coils, after getting a misfire on random cylinders with no pattern to tell which coil was bad. The car has 99,000 on it. I haven't yet checked spark plugs, but does anyone have an idea as to how I can fix this?

Thanks!!

He said, "Captain!" I said, "Wot?" Hi everyone!

The surprise twist of getting sober is that I’m now the [captain](https://youtu.be/XY2sIFLprPw) of a sports team. Well, co-captain. Of my women’s sober kickball team. It’s still pretty weird. I’m just about to head out to talk to someone at the park district about reserving a baseball diamond so we have somewhere to play, since I’m having a hard time getting anyone by phone who knows what’s going on, and I was told to come in and do it in person. Alrighty then. I can do that. I want my team t-shirt, so we need a place to play.

I’m gonna check out a Co-Dependents Anonymous meeting tonight. I’m finding that the “Co-Dependent No More” book is describing a lot of things that ring true for me, so I figure a meeting could be helpful.

Otherwise, my recovery work is ticking over. The only thing I’m having is trouble with is remembering to text my sponsor every morning. Which makes sense, when I think about it. Pretty much everything else that I’m doing is something that I’m doing on my own, even going to meetings is a self-directed activity. Texting my sponsor is directly reaching out for support, which is something that’s a bit new &amp; scary for me.

I put a note on my bathroom mirror to remind myself to text her, which worked today, anyway. She’s been great to work with and I do enjoy hearing from her, so I’m sure that I’ll get used to touching base with her regularly over time.

I’m still working on writing out my first step. She’s *encouraging* me to go on at length. I did warn her that that [wasn’t gonna be a problem for me](https://youtu.be/3Tx8jnndMes?t=1m45s), but she wants me to take my time and go into detail. She says that it’ll be helpful for when I work on my fourth step, and also give me notes to look over &amp; jog my memory before I give a lead. She’s a smart lady, and she knows a lot more about all this than I do, so I’m following her suggestions.

The newest suggestion is to get into regular meditation. I’m not tremendously great at sitting still and doing nothing, so I do have to work at mediation, but I can see how it’s helpful, so I’m adding it in. It’s taking me longer to find a volunteer opportunity than I anticipated, because the group that I was volunteering with before has recently shifted away from using outside volunteers. But I’m sure that I’ll find something.

Hope you all are well, off the face the park district!

Buying a Mazdaspeed 3 with 111k Miles Hey Mazda! I already have a 2007 Mazda 3 but this Speed came up for a bangin' price.

He's asking $3850 for it. Reason is he broke his foot and can't work, so he needs to pay medical bills. He did all of the mods himself. Claims that the previous owner had "cheap parts" on it that he has replaced. He's the 3rd owner. No receipts.

**Mods:**

- ACT Stage 1 clutch

- FMIC

- Defi boost gauge &amp; electronic module

- HKS SSQV blow off valve vented to atmosphere

- Greddy exhaust

- Cobb intake

- 3" Greddy downpipe

- Purple coilovers (he forgot the brand)

- Aftermarket wheels

- New K04 turbo because of shaft play

- 1 step colder spark plugs (claimed stock ones made the car run like trash)

**Issues:**

- It still has the stock VVT system, but it makes no noise.

- Stock high pressure fuel pump, but he claims fuel pressure is between 1600-1800 psi when WOT. He says he doesn't thrash it (like they all do).

- The SRS light is on (stock steering wheel and seats).

- Driver side CV axle is starting to click.



Here are the itty bitty pictures he provided.

I'm going to look at it later today. Am I opening a can of worms?

Ethiopian Traditional Food Chicken Doro Wat Recipe
Ethiopian most popular or traditional food is chicken stew “DORO WOT”.This dish is popular among us as Doro Wat. This is a popular dish on almost every menu card in an Ethiopian restaurant and probably hard to find any Ethiopian who is not familiar with this dish. This is a chicken stew prepared slowly on simmer with a spice blend. So whenever you are in Ethiopia, this is a must try dish for you. I can say this is the gateway to the Ethiopian cuisine. The dish is also known as “[**Tsebhi Dorho**](https://www.instagram.com/easylifeforeveryone/)” in the neighboring country Eritrea.  **\[**[**READ MORE**](https://www.easylifeforeveryone.com/ethiopian-traditional-food/)**\]**

Having problems with a lean spot while jetting my truck's carb Over the winter I slapped a Weber 32/36 DGEV carb onto my B2200 and recently I picked up a AEM air:fuel ratio gauge along with a jetting kit with the plans of getting the jetting more accurate (since I hadn't changed it out of the box). When I got it set up at first, the truck was running about 10-11:1 accelerating and crusing, then about 12.5:1 at WOT. It had 65/60 main and secodary idle jets, 145 for both barrel's main jets and 160 for the idle air corrector jet/170 for the main air corrector jet.


I started out by jetting down the main idle to 55 and the secondary to 50. I was able to get it to idle good about a turn and a half out on the mix screw with these jets. I jetted up from a 45 to a 50 on the secondary as the carb would lean out around 30-40% throttle.


Next I went after the main jets/air corrector jets. I started by jetting the 1st barrel's main jet down to 135 and bumping the idle air corrector to 170. I found it was leaning out at 75-100% throttle, so I changed the second barrel's main jet to 145 and moved the primary air corrector to 200. 


This setup got me running at about 13-14:1 accelerating/crusing and about 13.5:1 at WOT, but I have a issue with a lean spot. When I get above 50% throttle (and the 2nd barrel starts to open) it goes waaay lean, spiking to about 16-17:1. There's also a slight bog when you push the throttle down while crusing (as if you were passing on the highway) Though when I go to about 60% throttle it richens to about 15-14:1. Jetting up in the second barrel didn't help much. What seemed to work best was jetting up in the first barrel, but it also richened everything under half throttle (dropped from ~14:1 to like ~12:1).


Any advice on getting rid of that lean spot/what jetting setups are you guys running? I'll add that I'm %99 confident there aren't any vacuum leaks and my fuel pump/filter are good. Though I haven't changed the float settings or timing since installing the carb.

At the end of this second full week, man, I wanted to quit so bad.

**Thurs 8/16**

The cold-calling lawyers begging for free legal services front admittedly demoralized me a bit.

Many kept telling me to use the free legal clinics in my city, so I had to explain the sort of irony of my situation to them - that ***because*** I own no assets, no income, and have no permanent residence, I don't qualify for help from those clinics because I'm not perceived as at risk of a ***material loss***.

So I moved up earlier in my pitch the part where I mention every single legal clinic and town and how I've already spoken to them.

**I've always considered myself to have a thick skin**. I don't care what sort of criticism you throw at me, I can take it. I grew up in an Asian-American household, so *I don't care how harshly you insult me*, it's **nothing** to me.

It did get to me though. Because what I'm being rejected for is ***begging***.

I'm not used to it. I've never been a beggar.

*I've been so stubbornly and even destructively self-reliant that I've always refused to ask for help*. I've never lived off freebies before. You give value, you receive value. Asking for free help is hard in the first place, so a few of the cold calls *did* get me in the feels a bit - being interrupted, being told off, even ridiculed.

***Still, I must persist, and I must prevail***.

I took a couple short breaks when I needed to. Then kept trudging on, keeping myself moving forward, making more calls, moving down the list. I got stonewalled by secretaries a couple times, so I had to rethink my approach of which opening lines I begin with.

I tried to use every rejection as an attempt to re-evaluate and refine.

After a day full of rejections, I sat back. ***I felt like shit***. But I thought, "Am ***I*** a different person now from when I woke up this morning? **No**. Has ***my mission*** changed at all from when I woke up this morning? **No**."

That's all I need to keep going.

Still, I did get a few things done on Thursday:

* I reached out to my former contractors: people who worked themselves to the bone for me at my first business. Of all the creditors I let down, these people are the ones I feel **by far** the most pain for. I formally let them know of my bankruptcy, and also sent long, heartfelt, and sincere apologies. It was so good to ***finally*** do this and ***begin*** properly making amends.
* I ordered a social security card (it's free), since I didn't have one. I am **required** to have one for bankruptcy.
* Another requirement of bankruptcy is taking two educational courses, through one of the state-approved agencies: a credit counseling course before filing, and a debtor's education course immediately after filing. They cost $10-50 ***each***. Every single dollar hurts right now. Fortunately, based off the recommendation of the attorney who helped me at my state's free Bankruptcy Assistance Desk, I found one that offers an application to waive the fee based on financial aid. I applied.

**Friday 8/17**

This was when I really started feeling the emotional impact of the rejections. I noticed myself faltering a bit, beginning to hesitate before picking up the phone, shying away a little from the sting of yet another rejection.

**I thought back to when I was 18-20 years old**. Among the top two **most** important things in my life at the time was **chasing girls**. After an entire adolescence of repeated, nonstop romantic rejections, I was utterly sick of it. To change my life, I consciously devoted time and effort to politely approaching women and asking them out, wherever I could find them: in class, at the grocery store, bookstore, train station, on the street, yes bars/clubs too, etc etc etc...if they were up for it, great! If they wanted me to fuck off, I fucked off.

God probably doesn't want me doing that anymore. But He allowed that to be a part of my life in the past for a reason. Might as well take what I've learned from those experiences and apply them how I will. *The only response to rejection is to try again with someone else*.

So, as much as I wanted to just call it quits, all I could do was to pick up the phone and and keep dialing.

**ALL I NEED IS ONE.**

Just as when I was preoccupied with chasing girls, I wasn't really looking to "score" with as many girls as possible. I was looking for love with one person.

I can get rejected 500 times, but if the ONE right person says yes, then I have achieved my objective.

I lost all my best leads on Friday. The ones I'd marked green on my notes, for most likely contacts, all didn't get back to me. It sucked, especially as I eagerly awaited their calls all day.

I did accomplish one thing Friday: I hadn't heard back from the credit counseling agency yet regarding my application for the fee waiver on Thursday, and the rep had told me they usually get back the same day. So I called in and politely asked if they needed any more information. They began profusely apologizing and said **MY APPLICATION WAS APPROVED FOR BOTH** pre-filing AND post-filing courses! That's another $20 in my pocket.

**ANTI-BRIDGE BURNING UPDATE**

Wow, I am so, tremendously humbled, down to my knees.

If you asked me, of all the people I let down with my first business, for the *three people I hurt the most*, I would tell you the following three people.

One by one, *these exact three people* responded to me reaching out to them attempting to make amends.

1) On Thursday, I heard back from the woman whose entire family did the vast majority of the hard labor for my first business. ***I cannot understate how amazing they were and how much my business relied on all of them***. They worked themselves to the bone, were 100% reliable, *always* went above and beyond whenever the opportunity presented itself, paid out of pocket for supplies when I was a doofus and messed something up with the corporate card I gave them, and were always SO sweet and cheerful.

I screwed them over, ***hard***. They ended up **out about $30,000** from me for work they did that I could no longer pay. Why do bad things happen to good people? Well in this case, it's because I'm an irresponsible idiot.

I sent this woman a long, sincere message with no expectations. To my surprise and humility, **she responded saying that she understood, that she felt empathy for what I went through, and has been praying for me**. Even through everything I put her and her family through, she's chosen forgiveness, kindness, and understanding.

I immediately fell to my knees in a mix of disbelief, gratefulness, and shame. I thanked God for the reminder of the Grace and Love I've received despite not deserving it.

We exchanged a few messages, and I gently suggested meeting her and her husband in person sometime so that I could apologize to both of them by face. I was pleasantly surprised when she said they'd be happy to see me! Wow.

2) On Friday, I heard back from a contractor who worked as my go-to guy in many capacities. I could always count on him and always trust his judgement. When I first met him, I knew he was special, and I spent an entire month chasing him down and begging him to do some work for me. I also liked him because he's made a lot of hard choices in life, ones I related with deeply. One of the truly good guys, who stay good even through toil and isolation.

When my business capsized, he also just happened to undergo some severe trauma in his personal life. Certainly, me owing him considerable amounts of money didn't help.

He told me it was kind of me to reach out, that he enjoyed our time together, and that he wished me well. He also shared a tiny bit of his current situation.

Wow. I'd love to be able to see him as well to apologize in person, if it's ever possible.

3) On Saturday, I heard back from the guy who probably has the most to be angry at me about, even beyond money. As a key contractor (and really sweet, likeable guy!), I'd put him up in a corporate apartment we paid for. I'd thought it was a simple way to increase his compensation in a cost-effective way. I really wanted him happy.

Great idea, until I could no longer pay the rent on his apartment.

As my business started going up in flames and creditors everywhere started making demands of me, I shut down completely to where I was hardly even a human being. ***I went an entire week not even looking at my phone or email***. This contractor literally thought I'd died.

Worst of all, this also meant I neither paid the rent on his apartment, ***nor told him that his apartment was delinquent***. He had NO idea anything was wrong with his apartment until **the sheriff was knocking on his door serving him an eviction notice**.

I can't even imagine what that must have been like for him. He's a pet owner and musician and was greatly distressed over possibly losing ALL of his musical work and equipment.

I also owed him payment for several months' worth of work too.

Yet, through all of that, he responded on Sunday saying that it was actually good to hear from me, and that he wished me well!

I can't say that all that I expected these three people to respond to me with forgiveness and kindness. I can't change what I did to them, but I can learn from the experience and try to make something good out of it. I can't make up for what I did, but I will try.

**Sat 8/18**

Relaxed, resting from Friday's events, and worked through a good chunk of the mandatory credit counseling course.

**Sunday 8/19**

Church in the morning, then will get to see some good friends in the evening!!

At the end of this second full week, man, I wanted to quit so bad.

**Thurs 8/16**

The cold-calling lawyers begging for free legal services front admittedly demoralized me a bit.

Many kept telling me to use the free legal clinics in my city, so I had to explain the sort of irony of my situation to them - that ***because*** I own no assets, no income, and have no permanent residence, I don't qualify for help from those clinics because I'm not perceived as at risk of a ***material loss***.

So I moved up earlier in my pitch the part where I mention every single legal clinic and town and how I've already spoken to them.

**I've always considered myself to have a thick skin**. I don't care what sort of criticism you throw at me, I can take it. I grew up in an Asian-American household, so *I don't care how harshly you insult me*, it's **nothing** to me.

It did get to me though. Because what I'm being rejected for is ***begging***.

I'm not used to it. I've never been a beggar.

*I've been so stubbornly and even destructively self-reliant that I've always refused to ask for help*. I've never lived off freebies before. You give value, you receive value. Asking for free help is hard in the first place, so a few of the cold calls *did* get me in the feels a bit - being interrupted, being told off, even ridiculed.

***Still, I must persist, and I must prevail***.

I took a couple short breaks when I needed to. Then kept trudging on, keeping myself moving forward, making more calls, moving down the list. I got stonewalled by secretaries a couple times, so I had to rethink my approach of which opening lines I begin with.

I tried to use every rejection as an attempt to re-evaluate and refine.

After a day full of rejections, I sat back. ***I felt like shit***. But I thought, "Am ***I*** a different person now from when I woke up this morning? **No**. Has ***my mission*** changed at all from when I woke up this morning? **No**."

That's all I need to keep going.

Still, I did get a few things done on Thursday:

* I reached out to my former contractors: people who worked themselves to the bone for me at my first business. Of all the creditors I let down, these people are the ones I feel **by far** the most pain for. I formally let them know of my bankruptcy, and also sent long, heartfelt, and sincere apologies. It was so good to ***finally*** do this and ***begin*** properly making amends.
* I ordered a social security card (it's free), since I didn't have one. I am **required** to have one for bankruptcy.
* Another requirement of bankruptcy is taking two educational courses, through one of the state-approved agencies: a credit counseling course before filing, and a debtor's education course immediately after filing. They cost $10-50 ***each***. Every single dollar hurts right now. Fortunately, based off the recommendation of the attorney who helped me at my state's free Bankruptcy Assistance Desk, I found one that offers an application to waive the fee based on financial aid. I applied.

**Friday 8/17**

This was when I really started feeling the emotional impact of the rejections. I noticed myself faltering a bit, beginning to hesitate before picking up the phone, shying away a little from the sting of yet another rejection.

**I thought back to when I was 18-20 years old**. Among the top two **most** important things in my life at the time was **chasing girls**. After an entire adolescence of repeated, nonstop romantic rejections, I was utterly sick of it. To change my life, I consciously devoted time and effort to politely approaching women and asking them out, wherever I could find them: in class, at the grocery store, bookstore, train station, on the street, yes bars/clubs too, etc etc etc...if they were up for it, great! If they wanted me to fuck off, I fucked off.

God probably doesn't want me doing that anymore. But He allowed that to be a part of my life in the past for a reason. Might as well take what I've learned from those experiences and apply them how I will. *The only response to rejection is to try again with someone else*.

So, as much as I wanted to just call it quits, all I could do was to pick up the phone and and keep dialing.

**ALL I NEED IS ONE.**

Just as when I was preoccupied with chasing girls, I wasn't really looking to "score" with as many girls as possible. I was looking for love with one person.

I can get rejected 500 times, but if the ONE right person says yes, then I have achieved my objective.

I lost all my best leads on Friday. The ones I'd marked green on my notes, for most likely contacts, all didn't get back to me. It sucked, especially as I eagerly awaited their calls all day.

I did accomplish one thing Friday: I hadn't heard back from the credit counseling agency yet regarding my application for the fee waiver on Thursday, and the rep had told me they usually get back the same day. So I called in and politely asked if they needed any more information. They began profusely apologizing and said **MY APPLICATION WAS APPROVED FOR BOTH** pre-filing AND post-filing courses! That's another $20 in my pocket.

**ANTI-BRIDGE BURNING UPDATE**

Wow, I am so, tremendously humbled, down to my knees.

If you asked me, of all the people I let down with my first business, for the *three people I hurt the most*, I would tell you the following three people.

One by one, *these exact three people* responded to me reaching out to them attempting to make amends.

1. On Thursday, I heard back from the woman whose entire family did the vast majority of the hard labor for my first business. ***I cannot understate how amazing they were and how much my business relied on all of them***. They worked themselves to the bone, were 100% reliable, *always* went above and beyond whenever the opportunity presented itself, paid out of pocket for supplies when I was a doofus and messed something up with the corporate card I gave them, and were always SO sweet and cheerful.

2014 Mustang GT Clutch Noticed recently after I took my 2014 Mustang GT to the drag strip that when going WOT, that I am getting locked out of 3rd gear. My clutch pedal is literally stuck down and I need to pull it up with my foot. I am then able to push the clutch in a shift into 3rd. Tried it again on the way back home on an empty road and it happened again. Does not always occur when going WOT. I’ve looked it up online but only solution I am able to find is a clutch spring assist removal but that seems to only fix the feelings of having a soft clutch. Only things done to the car has been a tune and headers.

"Oh, let me just have ONE of these tasty sweets..." Today I lost the sugar batte. It hurts. Personal pain - a brief story. WOT I feel like if I get this out, if I make a post, it will help motivate me. Maybe this will help motivate you as well! &lt;3

I hate feeling like this!

Let me start out by saying I did not find this diet from a desire to lose weight, moreso to fix the crazy acid reflux/GERD/indigestion, or whatever it is that's bothering me. It's been making me feel terrible for years. Candida overgrowth? Food intolerance? I'm not sure what, but my diet has to change.

Since I'm not overweight, perhaps that's one of the reasons I find it so hard. I can look in the mirror, and I'm still quite happy with what I see, so "I don't need to diet!" But the truth is, when I eat garbage, I hate how I feel. Anxious. Paranoid. Stressed. Depressed. Guilty... And I cannot stop.

Being a former drug user (8+ months sober from drugs and alcohol, yay), perhaps I'm more likely to fall victim to the addictive nature of sugars/carbohydrates. Maybe I am just weak willed at the moment... Stress from a bad job, an undesirable living situation, and struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder... It's probably a combination of all these factors.

Anyway, I have experimented with various diets on and off for years, but never for long. Paleo, gluten free, dairy free, minimally processed, etc etc. I try to be healthy. I often consume lemons, ACV, cayenne pepper, tumeric, vitamins, as well as other "food medicines" and generally they make me feel good. I run 2+ miles every day without fail (got a 4 month streak going!), often adding in a brief gym routine, core exercises, and/or squats... Which is all well and good until I "cheat".

But damn, when I cheat, I cheat HARD. Today... Oh man I don't even want to tell you, but I will. I have to get this out.

Started with bacon and eggs... Wish I didn't move to the pancakes... Maybe if I just have ONE...

5 pancakes, syrup, super sugared coffee, pie, double stuff Oreos, ice cream sandwich, 4 little bags of chips, kit kats, Oreo cookie bar, Hershey's cookies and cream bar, 4 mini brownie ice cream sandwiches - with a whole can of whipped cream *obviously*, red mango frozen yogurt with as many toppings as would fit ...

I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff, this is only what I remember. When I start eating like this, it's like I "black out" sometimes, and just go into a zone where I barely hear or see what's around me. I just don't care. I crave this shit.

Enough about the bad, let's talk about the good for a while. I've been cycling with 4-6 days "good" diet then 1-2 days heavy binging. When I eat well, holy shit do I feel good!

My general schedule:

Breakfast:
Lemons + cayenne, fresh ginger, maybe green tea

Lunch:
Organic ground beef, romaine lettuce, spinach, broccoli

Dinner:
Organic chicken drumsticks, asparagus, salad, avocado

And of course lots of butter on everything!

When I stick to this, I surprise myself with just how GOOD I feel! Energy, mood lift, sociability... Good digestion! For the first time in my life I'm eating food and not tasting it as it comes back up my esophagus. I almost didn't know this was possible.

But then I cave. I have Oreos or some other carbage. And all hell breaks loose!

I'm sure some of you can relate, based on what I've read here, but I need to change. If I can just get over that one week hump... I'll be back on top! I can feel amazing everyday. The cravings will go away. I'll get my life back.

I hope this post serves as a reminder to you why you made the changes you did, or a motivator to those still struggling like me.

I'm determined to pick myself up and keep going.

Keto has been a diet that has made me feel better than any other way of eating I've previously tried... When I reread that line, it even more enforces why I'm doing what I'm doing.

I'm so glad I typed this out. Much love to you all

MH&lt;333


TLDR
Today I binged super hard. Feel like shit. Keto is the only diet I've tried that makes me feel amazing. I need to keep it up and not slip. I hope this post serves as a reminder to me and maybe you as well why KCKO is the shit!

Tales of Milo, the needlessly show-offy halfling Sorry for the pretty lengthy story, I suck at getting to the point.

&gt;be me, Halfling College of Swords Bard (you'll never have my bardic inspiration) with Gladiator BG and a prosthetic arm
&gt;
&gt;be not me, chill (but not too much) DM, Human Hexblade warlock (I think? He's hidden under an armor), weird homebrew class human, Soldier Drow and winged tiefling sorcerer
&gt;
&gt;Level 3 btw
&gt;
&gt;We're one of the "Purge Squads" employed with destroying an ancient menace
&gt;
&gt;second session
&gt;
&gt;we're walking back to camp after purging a cave of sum reptilians called Magmar
&gt;
&gt;DM is like "The camp looks empty, but you can hear some sounds coming from it"
&gt;
&gt;River in the way, can easily be walked across...
&gt;
&gt;...by anyone who is not a 70cm tall midget.
&gt;
&gt;"I jump over it"
&gt;
&gt;It works, +7 in acrobatics paying off
&gt;
&gt;Other players decide to take a cautious approach and notice some mounds of dirt around the camp
&gt;
&gt;I don't, I just walk there (already got knocked out twice for not being cautious but whatevs)
&gt;
&gt;Someone from inside the camp shouts "Look out!" but nah m8
&gt;
&gt;"Roll Dexterity save"
&gt;
&gt;Ok.jpg
&gt;
&gt;20 (15+5)
&gt;
&gt;The ground gives out from underneath me, I barely make it in time
&gt;
&gt;wtf
&gt;
&gt;Big ass dwarf (for my standards) with a massive flaming bow in hand comes out to greet me
&gt;
&gt;Sugoi.mp4
&gt;
&gt;Fast forward 2 hours
&gt;
&gt;He \*still\* has that flaming bow in hand
&gt;
&gt;"Doesn't it hurt?"
&gt;
&gt;"Nope"
&gt;
&gt;"How"
&gt;
&gt;He explains to me how around the forest there are these altars from a time where the elementals of fire wanted to burn it all down, but were driven off by some warriors. They were so impressed with the warriors that they decided to give them the power of flames.
&gt;
&gt;fast forward 2 days
&gt;
&gt;DM: "Roll encounter"
&gt;
&gt;"80"
&gt;
&gt;"You see this patch of forest that is completely burned to the ground, blackened by flames"
&gt;
&gt;Entire party of sane people are like "We should just keep going, we're on a time limit"
&gt;
&gt;But this is me we're talking about
&gt;
&gt;"I go check it out"
&gt;
&gt;DM tells me how there's this huge altar with some writing in it
&gt;
&gt;asks if I know either of 2 languages he invented
&gt;
&gt;"Nope"
&gt;
&gt;Yourloss.jpg
&gt;
&gt;I go grab the rest of the party who, fed up with my BS, relents since it's nothing \*immediately\* dangerous
&gt;
&gt;They can read one language, and sort of make out the rest more or less
&gt;
&gt;The language they can read says that the altar activates via blood
&gt;
&gt;The one they can make out says "Fire... Honor... fighting...Glory..."
&gt;
&gt;At this point they're horrified in metagame of what I'm about to do
&gt;
&gt;"I cut open my hand right above the altar"
&gt;
&gt;MiloNo.jpg
&gt;
&gt;MiloYES.jpg
&gt;
&gt;"I want to stop him" says wizard tiefling
&gt;
&gt;My acrobatics vs his athletics
&gt;
&gt;I've already won
&gt;
&gt;my 24 to his 3
&gt;
&gt;I manage to do it
&gt;
&gt;fire elemental appears
&gt;
&gt;asks me if I was the one to activate the ritual
&gt;
&gt;Everyone tells me to say no
&gt;
&gt;"Yes, 'twas me"
&gt;
&gt;a ring of fire appears around me, I'm at one of the edges
&gt;
&gt;at the other edge, a minor fire elemental appears
&gt;
&gt;fire elemental points at my chest, a flame sparks up
&gt;
&gt;minor fire elemental is excited
&gt;
&gt;"Roll initiative"
&gt;
&gt;I roll a 20 nat
&gt;
&gt;The DM sighs and says there's literally no way that the fire elemental can beat me so he just tells me to do my turn
&gt;
&gt;I point at it with my scimitar (spellcasting focus)
&gt;
&gt;"Shatter!" 17 damage, not bad
&gt;
&gt;still standing though, and I'm a lowly bard
&gt;
&gt;he charges at me, and propels himself at me with an explosion, punching me in the chest
&gt;
&gt;10 damage out of my 19 hp, roll dc 13 saving throw in STR
&gt;
&gt;uh-oh.jpg
&gt;
&gt;Party is facepalming all around
&gt;
&gt;I roll STR saving throw
&gt;
&gt;NAT 20
&gt;
&gt;He's the one to fall prone by virtue of me knocking him back with my chest
&gt;
&gt;lmao.jpg
&gt;
&gt;I attack, he's nearly dead
&gt;
&gt;Defensive flourish!
&gt;
&gt;1 more AC and Dmg out of 6 I could've gotten
&gt;
&gt;fuckme
&gt;
&gt;The thing literally explodes in a nova of fire
&gt;
&gt;"Roll dex saving throw"
&gt;
&gt;25 (Nat 20)
&gt;
&gt;Holy balls I'm so lucky today
&gt;
&gt;The DM is trying to sound serious, but it's clear that what he's about to say isn't all that much
&gt;
&gt;"The demon explodes into ring of fire that you manage to jump over, taking only two damage. However" \*snicker\* "after that, he heals for all of the damage dealt"
&gt;
&gt;mfw a demon used a supermove and dealt only 2 dmg and healed by 2
&gt;
&gt;I finish it off with my scimitars
&gt;
&gt;The DM tells me to finish it, I ask if there is a point where it'll leave an impression. Informs me that there is a gem on its forehead
&gt;
&gt;take out my harpoon (gladiator weapon) and spear it right into the gem
&gt;
&gt;it shatters completely, the fire elemental dissipates
&gt;
&gt;Major fire elemental reappears
&gt;
&gt;offers me three perks
&gt;
&gt;permanent resistance to cold damage, the ability to use my reaction and absorb as hp all fire damage I take or to deal 2d3 as fire damage (the latter two are once per combat)
&gt;
&gt;The first two sound really useful
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, flaming weapons
&gt;
&gt;(insert spongebob fish meme)
&gt;
&gt;fast forward two days

&gt;Old man stuck under his cart

&gt;
&gt;snake chases fake mouse into a bush, bites rock and scurries away
&gt;
&gt;I walk up to the cart
&gt;
&gt;"Let me roll strength to lift the cart"

&gt;
&gt;Dm is fed up with my shit by now, but has to narrate.
&gt;
&gt;"\*ahem\* Milo, from his imposing stature of 70 centimeters, hoists the cart up and off the man's leg, puts it down on the ground and doesn't even break a sweat."
&gt;
&gt;"Why even bother making him roll?" Hexblade asks.
&gt;
&gt;Heal old man leg with cure wounds while I'm casually walking around with 3 hp
&gt;
&gt;Everything else goes without a hitch, bunch of chores the guy asked us to do.
&gt;
&gt;Fast forward one day
&gt;
&gt;"The Merchant" comes into the city
&gt;
&gt;You know which merchant, the one who has so much stuff you need a Word document just to see your options
&gt;
&gt;Look through the list
&gt;
&gt;"Dramatic Cape" costs 100g which is half the money I have
&gt;
&gt;only use is to flutter in the wind
&gt;
&gt;Brain: "Buy"
&gt;
&gt;Me: "Why?"
&gt;
&gt;Brain: "You gotta"
&gt;
&gt;I buy the cape, it's one size fits all and can change color
&gt;
&gt;I already have a purple sash on my chest so purple cape goes nicely with my it
&gt;
&gt;I can use a bonus action to activate it or make it activate upon doing a certain action
&gt;
&gt;I tell it to activate once I extract my scimitars
&gt;
&gt;DM goes "Want to try it?"
&gt;
&gt;Sure
&gt;
&gt;I walk into the plaza, extract my scimitars and light them on fire
&gt;
&gt;cape flutters heroically in the wind with a "swoosh" sound
&gt;
&gt;NPC walks up to me
&gt;
&gt;"Help! There is a m-monster eating people by the river!"
&gt;
&gt;I chuckle to myself
&gt;
&gt;"Don't worry, I'll take care of it"

Wrench light + ESC on light on cold start Started the car after 2 days of sitting still to move it out of the garage for cleaning. Drove about 1 mile, parked and turned it off. 5 mins later came back to start the car and run some errands, wrench light + ESC on light on the dash, car wouldn't move in 1st gear no matter how much gas I gave it. I turned it off, waited 5 seconds, turned it back on - no lights, runs and drives fine. Wtf was that?! No codes no nothing, still drives fine. Did WOT pull this morning after 30 mins of driving (to make sure car warmed up everywhere) - made 20.5 psi of boost. This has never happened to me before. ECU glitched or something?

Limited Boost / Turbo Issue? [Stock] Hey Guys,

Sadly I have finally ran into my first problem with the car just shy of 20k miles. I am noticing hardly any boost when hitting the throttle like I usually do. I managed to go WOT and saw the gauge go into over-boost but my butt dyno did not feel it pulling like it should. I remember reading that turbo charged vehicles tend to have a bit less of an exhaust sound due to the way the air is circulated (sorry for extreme simplification). But my Borla is way louder than it usually is since this issue popped up. I just tossed the ST on jack stands and have checked all the tubing from the turbo/intercooler/intake and everything is solid and connected.

Checking what I could for everything else under the hood and I am really not seeing anything out of place. No fluids, loose connections, etc. I have not yet tried disconnecting the battery to reset the ECU, curious if I should or if there is anything I am missing?

The turbo does sound like it is spooling, nothing out of the ordinary. I just have what feels to be no real boost and the exhaust is increasingly louder. Short of taking it in to the dealer, I am not sure what else I can do. Any suggestions? Thanks.

[PI] Truth behind Reasons: Archetypes Part 2 – 2969 Words [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/958a2w/pi_truth_behind_reasons_archetypes_part_1_2355/)

**5.357\23:82:17x1**
**QX-87-78231.5 in Orbit**

Gavik Praulotti might have been the black skaq'g of the family, but he didn't care about their opinions on the matter. Some of them called him a pirate or a pillager behind his back, but the truth was far kinder. He was an opportunist. *Well maybe a bit of a scavenger, I certainly don't rob the living,* he pondered as his salvage scow pulled up on the drifting wreck.

Gav was far off the charted course in a sector of far space without a name, only a numeric designation: QX-87-78231, above the 5th planet of the system. Someone, years ago had laid a grid out over the uncharted regions and mathematically assigned numbers to every star no one had bothered visiting. He was sure more than a half dozen cultures had names for the star at the heart of this system, but no one had bothered cross referencing it yet.

Deep salvage was dangerous and lonely work for his small crew, almost akin to treasure hunting. But it was also safe in the regard that no one would lay claim against him. The jump out here had been risky and he'd spent many a tzet looking for anything of worth. He hoped at least for some rare metals or maybe one of the accidental floating asteroid sized diamonds the universe sometimes cast off into space.

He never expected to find a massive floating metal corpse trapped in high orbit. The dead ship was well over half a kilometer in length and looked like a battlecruiser that was on the loosing end of an ugly war. The scoring and rupture-blisters on the hull were long cooled and the engine core seemed depleted.

"Humph, didn't want to put on a pressure suit, but that thing has more holes than your underwear, Gavik." The maroon, equine face of Jajj Xulhan leaned over his shoulder. His Wurgel crewman's lung-ridge pulsed behind his neck as the two-and-a-half meter tall being exhaled in annoyance. Wurgel weren't often comfortable in pressure suits, but Jajj wasn't about to let anyone else on the crew swindle his find.

It had actually been Jajj at the sensor suite when they picked up the scan that lead them here.

"You're always welcome to stay behind," Gav joked as the *Plunderer's Pride* nestled against the larger vessel like a klach wasp. The magnetic clamps made a comforting thud as they secured solid purchase.

Jajj just stared at him in stroking the braided hairs on his chin. He ignored the jest and moved to a supposition, "No life in the system, all the planets are dead. This ship must have drifted in, which means it's older than your mother."

"Leave momma Praulotti out of this, Jajj. It's not her fault I'm unwanted. How old do you think?"

The Wurgel rolled his excessively long arms around their shoulder joints, "Impossible to know unless we radio-date something aboard. Maybe a corpse. If they drifted from another system, a dead race we haven't uncovered? Who knows. Could be thousands of years or millions. Or they were just drifting in this system after some sort of FTL failure and died here. May have only been here a few hundred. Let's hope they don’t have friends or enemies for that matter who are still around."

Gavik grimaced as he looked out the viewport at the twisted metal wounds, "Yes, let's."

--------

The four-person salvage team of the *Plunderer's Pride* drifted into the void of one of the larger holes adjacent their vessel. Lights embedded in their suits strobed out, illuminating the intricate design work of the wreck. What was left intact was beautiful and ornate, latticework upon white grills and plating. From what Gav could tell this culture blended art forms seamlessly with function. His Iwrandici blood appreciated the design.

Every few meters, the beauty of the vessel was interrupted by horrific injuries and gaping gashes that looked to be inflicted by beam weapons or explosives. *A tragedy, I think I would have liked to meet them.*

"Gah!" someone behind him screamed into their microphone. Gav used his thrusters to curl around and point his plasma cutter in that direction. Cursing himself for not bringing a legitimate weapon, he watched as Ogg flailed, miserably fending off a frozen humanoid corpse.

Everyone else laughed.

"Wot! Es a gods damn body. I hates corpses." He shoved it away and cursed everyone for laughing at him.

Jajj calmly floated over to the remains and pressed a tool into it's flash-frozen flesh. Gavik pushed off a near bulkhead to join his inquisitive companion. The body was wearing a shipsuit of unknown design, simple, yet flattering and accented with markings of what he assumed were its language. It appeared male and had a blueish tint even after all these years, with darker blue tattoos or natural symmetric skin markings on the cheeks, chin, and brow. A tight cut of red hair with a teal streak waived softly in the null-gravity. Handsome, even in the rigor or death.

"Thousands," Jajj muttered.

Everyone else whistled or cursed. Gavik breathed a silent sigh of relief and thanked the goddess. "I guess that means we won't have to worry about friends and family stopping in for leftovers," he joked.

"Or any 'ting else," Ogg chimed in.

Jajj muttered some more things in his native tongue rather than trade-speak. The translator didn't make the right connections.

"What?" Gav asked, resting a hand on Jajj's arm holding the body in place.

"Readings are a bit wonk, but its at least four thousand years old, possibly more. Genetics don't match anything known and it's dense and well… not quite similar to most species. Something unique in there, but its causing havoc with the limited instruments aboard the *Pride*. Can't get an accurate read." He drew in a long breath, giving a thought time to formulate, "I know more than a few universities that would pay bank if we can keep this frozen for the return trip, if just for the novelty."

Ogg gave a grim chuckle, "Oi, I'll put ups with mad corpses for the right coin. Sure, there's tons of dead lovelies here."

"Ever the romantic, Ogg. No respect for the dead?" Keppi, their engineer, criticized.

"Respek the coin in my pocket. The credits in my account." He shrugged his shoulders, "Why else we 'ere? Not fo nothin' else. Ain' galactic trashmen. Ain' morticians. Ain' priests."

Jajj nodded, "No, indeed we are not." His deep baritone voice had a calming effect, "That said, most societies still look ill upon disturbing remains. Salvage is one thing, this… tread carefully. I'm picking up some faint energy readings."

His eyes drifted to his own sensors, Gavik saw them too. There were two, one fore, one aft. "Top or bottom, old man?"

The tall Wurgel rolled his head, a sign of unsettled nerves. "I'll take Keppi and Uuss to the aft. I'm assuming it is main propulsion and engineering. See what the blip is and if we can pull some tech. Hopefully, Keppi can make sense of the power grid. Take the other two with you and scout the bridge?"

Gavik nodded, "Sure. If that's what's on the front end." They had studied a modeling of the wreck and tied to piece together it's vaguely elongated egg shape into something that made sense. Even if the ship had been completely intact and not half a cloud of debris, knowing what an alien mindset on design was guesswork at best.

As the teams split, he wished them all good fortune. Propulsion packs and bulkhead kicks moved them quickly through the floating mausoleum, past quite a few many corpses. One thing Gav noticed was how many of the designs seemed to form triplicates. Workstations, crew stations, quarters, even the artwork seemed focused on crew teams of three or patterns thereof.

"Wot a weird circle," Ogg exclaimed, stopping to look at an intact design.  Gavik pulled himself over to see for himself. It was a series of tabbed rings and broken lines embedded one upon another with empty space separating them. Green, then blue, then grey surrounded a red sphere at the core. Three hollow wedges were evenly spaced along the outside edge, each reaching from the outside green to one of the inner colors. He looked at it and moved his light to a better angle, in the core of the red sphere he made out a black void in the center. It was almost hypnotic. He saw minor wear along tracks as if the whole thing moved.

Ogg reached out to touch it, Gavik stopped him, "No Ogg. Could be a time piece, could be religious, might even be art. Something in my gut says 'hands off'."

"Right, cap'in. Could be bad. Better safe, m'right." His hand retracted as if sudden movement would startle a hidden jek'wolf.

They continued through the roomy corridor past a number of closed hatches, ducking under collapsed pipework until they came to a large, ornate double hatch. It was closed. One look, told that it was sturdy enough to prevent brute force. He was debating whether to cut through it or climb around on the hull looking for an alternative route when the lights on the panel next to him flickered to life.

"Keppi got some minimal power back on," Jajj's voice rang across the comms. Scary how well they built this to last. "Scarier still what might have killed them."

"Ever the optimist Jajj, keep it low in case the reactor is damaged."

"It is, Captain," Keppi responded in her high trill, "that's the impressive part. It seems to have multiple redundancies even within the reactor core." She paused, "If I'm reading this right. No abnormal rads showing yet. We're safe for now. Not much output left though. Won't be flying her anywhere. Just enough to open some doors, run a few terminals."

He congratulated her efforts and pressed a green button next to the hatch. It fussed and he could feel the whine of vibration through his glove as if the machine was straining to remember its function. If it was angry about a lack of pressure, it found none on either side and eventually complied with his request to open.

The salvagers moved into the open space that certainly looked like a bridge for a vessel this size. There were terminals and workstations spread around the ring with three chairs in the middle all back to back. Shattered screen glass and wires floated among the corpses, glittering in the beams of their suit lights. Frost and horror etched on every face that floated in the void, told him they were alive when victory was denied along with whatever they were breathing.

One terminal remained intact, save for a small crack running along the top corner. It glowed softly with a number of symbols. Gavik risked it and pressed one. Nothing visible happened. He pressed three more before a small emitter began to glow near by and display a holographic image.

It looked like the bridge, but in better condition. The crew was furiously operating their stations while fighting a silent battle. Even if he could hear the audio, it would be pointless. The male looking crewman yelled back at him as if it were struggling to communicate with someone. Then the scene was replaced with a slow spinning model of a different ship. It was a featureless fat wedge, but still managed to look menacing. It certainly scared the crewman whose face returned even more panicked. Gavik saw the man next to him die, inflicting agony upon the talking man and the other mand to his right as if they were connected. Then the transmission cut out as everything flared around them.

Ogg whistled, "Dat dere is death, that other ship. Dat's wot kilt them."

"Yeah, yeah. Obviously. Let's see if we can’t find the source of that ping." Gavik moved away from the console and drifted to the other end, waving the sensors attached to his glove around.

"Gav, we have a problem back here," Jajj called across the comms. "We found the source of the signal. It's pulsing."

He cleared his throat twice, "Pulsing? Is it a bomb?"

Keppi responded, "No, I don't think so. Not that kind of radiation. It's not building, but it is increasing. I think it’s a beacon."

Gavik's mind raced, there was no possible way anyone was coming back after four-thousand standard years. Civilizations came and went in half that time. *So why do I have a pit in my stomach?* He slapped his wrist, "Everyone back to the ship. Grab anything interesting you see on the way that won't slow you down."

He saw what looked like a data tablet floating in the air next to him and shoved it in his pocket as they scrambled to the open hatch. Gavik watched Ogg stop to try and pry a piece of artwork loose, "Not if it slows you down, Ogg. Go!"

Panic crept into his heart as a shadow played across the hall, starlight blotted out. He refused to look through the lacerations in the hull and pushed his suit thrust pack to max, launching him down the hallway towards their ingress. "Faster," he commanded them all.

By the time the *Pride* was in sight, four of his crew were gathered, some with odds and ends in hand. He pointed at the ship, waving both arms in a frantic ushering gesture. "Where is Keppi?"

"She wanted to see if she could rig the engines to go critical. I told her she had three minutes." Jajj replied as he moved towards the *Pride.*

This wasn't time to leave every being to their own, he was mildly infuriated with Jajj for a moment. Deep breaths drew him the same conclusion, however. They were mostly unarmed and this may be a last-ditch effort for anyone to get away, "Keppi!"

He waited a full minute for her to respond and was about to call for her again when she rounded the corner empty handed. Gavik could live with that if she was alive. "Success?"

She shrugged and grabbed the corpse they had tested, "We'll see."

Moments later they were all aboard, but nothing sinister was showing on their scanners. *Have I overreacted to n-,* before he could finish his thought a large black distortion in space crept over the bow of the wreck, hidden by it’s mass. Everyone who had gone to the bridge recognized its form instantly.

"Bad news?" Jajj questioned.

"Bad news." Gav echoed in somber whisper as he released the mag locks and pushed off from the derelict hull. Sliding the engine selectors up to maximum thrust, he said a silent prayer to the goddess Bashtet. He began a roll out of panic and reflex, his hands shaking. "Jajj, punch up my brother Hom'mel in the sub-space link. He knows some people. We need to warn him."

"Warn him of what, exactly," Jajj questioned his logic, "What do we actually know? Big black ship, killed a bunch of people a real long time ago?"

Kappi kept a clear head, "We have some sensor data and the data from the bodies. It's something at least. I can have a package ready in a minute."

The *Pride* as she sat down at the terminal. Ogg could be heard in the aft cursing at the corpse. Gavik couldn't tell if he was mad at it for bringing the doom or mad at it for being dead.

Kappi cursed herself a moment later, "Whatever hit us killed the sub-space transmitter. We only have laser and high-band."

"Slag all, we've got no one to point a comm laser at and we're a few thousand light years away for anyone to hear our high-band."

"Sent it anyways," Kappi huffed, "Who knows. Maybe we'll get luck-"

The *Plunderer's Pride* disintegrated into atoms as the main gun of the large obsidian craft sliced through it. The only evidence left that they existed was scattered energy of their high-band radio screaming out a data burst in a dozen directions of towards known civilization. Probably only to ever fall on the deaf ears of the empty cosmos that stretched the gulf between the *Pride* and home.

As quietly as it appeared, the large vessel disappeared back from whence it came. Three minutes after that the unnamed wreck exploded in a fireball as its reactor went critical far to late to do anyone any good.

--------------------------

**5.357\23:88:04x1**
**Antimoll**

Hom shook his head in annoyance. They weren't getting anywhere with their query. Jundili sighed, they'd been at it an hour and the big lug wasn't making any sense.

"Come on Trask, make sense. Why are you doing it?"

"Reigl, Reigl, Reigl," the oaf kept muttering.

Hom'mel rolled his eyes, "Yes, we know Reigl, the Kell god of death. What about Reigl?" He watched the Kell drool. "You know dear," he turned to Judili, "This is what happens when you mix the serum with alcohol."

She shrugged and poked the Kell Ambassador, "Reigl what?"

His head rolled on his massive shoulders and his eyes flared, "The black teeth of Reigl will descend upon the galaxy and devour you all." His timber was loud and bellicose, followed by the foulest vomit Hom'mel had ever witnessed. Both he and Jundili recoiled and jumped back to avoid the contents.

She pinched her nose looking at the beast as he sat still, tongue hanging from his gaping maw, "I think he's dead."

Hom'mel nodded, sensors in his suit agreed with the assessment, "What a waste and what a bunch of gibberish. Hate to go back to the Sat'ra empty handed." *It is what it is, but what the Kell god of death has to do with anything is up to the scholars to figure out.*

Anyone have music that seems to fit WoT really well? I feel like the song Cry Thunder by Dragonforce has lyrics that match pretty closely to The Wheel of Time.

```
Time after time as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls
Night after night for the glory we fight
In a kingdom of madness and the tales from the old

Death by our hand for the higher command
As the darkness surrounds us hear the cries as they fall
Fire burning steel and the tyrant will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory, pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands, endless rise to the heroes before

Cry thunder! Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder! Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day for the demons we slay
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all
Chaos still reigns devastation and flames
For the ultimate glory when the legacy calls

March on through the hellfire blazing from the darkness beyond
Nightmares return of the thousand screaming, rise for the heroes once more

Cry thunder! Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder! Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Unholy darkness in the eyes of broken dreams
Outside of the wasted and torn
A land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling
And the fallen will rise up again
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder! Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder! Strong in command
Saviour of nations, freedom of man
Cry thunder! Sword in his hand
Warriors defending, one final stand
Cry thunder! Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man
```

Could be a perfect song for the Asha'man

Exhaust noise during high-RPM upshift on newer performance automatic transmissions? OK, this is the most clueless I have felt asking a car question on the internet in a long time, please forgive me.

A few weeks back, my Dad and I were out hooning my step-Mom's 2018 Camaro RS convertible (lol we're 69 and 40, respectively), and we noticed when upshifting from 2nd to 3rd at high RPM/WOT that it makes kind of a strange "cackle" noise out of the exhaust, kinda of a cool, aggressive sound. A week later I saw a Porsche Panamera accelerating hard on the street, and heard it make a similar noise upon upshift. It didn't sound like a rev limiter, but with auto trans these wouldn't normally be able to hit a limiter, would they? What is this that we are hearing? I am guessing some new feature for electronically-controlled automatics in performance applications? Google didn't present much, though I didn't feel I was coming up with good ideas for search terms.

Thanks for any insight, its been kinda bugging me for weeks, and my Dad is curious too. I know a lot of you here are much more familiar with modern cars than either of us.

Bike question Hey fellow rider
So my bike does not turn over at all nothing. The dash lights come on blinkers work light works so I do the screwdriver trick to the starter soleniod n the bike turns over but doesnt start n run. Is the soleniod shit it’s self? If not wot other problem could it b? It’s my first bike n tying to learn how to fix it.

Learning to ride on a liter bike I'll preface this by saying I DO NOT SUGGEST TO ANYONE to do this. I decided to due to time constraints and some other circumstances that won't matter to you guys anyways so I'll save our time.
The added weight, looming temptations, and risk of dropping is too high. Yes, I dropped the bike, yes, it'll probably happen to you. Start on a cheapie.

Motorcycle is a 2008 YZF R1.


Here are the notes of the learning curve and lessons learned as I was beginning:


 Before truly riding on the road, I considered detuning techniques such as partially blocking the air intake or installing a make-shift throttle restrictor to limit the effect of “whiskey throttle”. I was very scared of effects of my inexperience, outside my own power and behavior, causing an accident. Because of this I would read pages about starting on a liter bike, techniques to improve riding technique, posture, and applying these skills in parking lots in order to minimize driver error/inexperience causing my first crash. A lot of this reading was invaluable in overcoming the initial learning curve. Never ended up detuning/installing safety devices.


Motorcycle learning

Miles 0-10: Rebuild phase (vehicle was salvaged)

Couple of test rides. Learning gearbox. Low speed roads, familiarizing self with light neighborhood traffic and low speed turning. Sampled 40% of throttle in low RPM.

Miles 10-50.
 Short highway drive, learn true values of counter-steering. Higher speed roads (40 mph). Followed by long highway. Jarred by power of wind at 80 mph highway speeds and balance at high speeds. Exhaustion from riding and heat onsets 20 miles into long drive. Sampled 60% throttle. Strong fear and weariness. 3 to 4/10 confidence.

 Miles 50-100. Return trip on highway. Following low speed parking lot maneuver practice. Much more comfortable in sharper higher speed curves. Comfortable with throttle modulation and proper seating/riding position and keeping weight off arms. Confidence level 6/10. Riding becomes somewhat enjoyable. Counter steering still not second nature. Sampled 70% throttle.

Miles 100-200. Watching speed limit and cruising technique first becomes apparent. Much more comfortable (7.5/10) in traffic and riding. Enjoyable experience. Far more comfortable making turns/instantaneous use of counter steering, and low speed parking lot maneuvers and u turns.

Miles 200-300. Maneuvering in low and high speeds is still challenging at times (Need to warm up/practice more often) Throttle cable and clutch handle need adjustments. Used 80% throttle (not to redline yet).

Miles 300-400: Practice pulled 100% throttle. Didn’t go beyond first gear WOT. Comfortable with throttle. Complacency/exhaustion incident: Nudged front brake to a dead stop a little too carelessly and motorcycle was within a foot of laying on it’s side.
 Somehow developed a bad habit of applying far more pressure on the rear brake than the front.
 Continuously practicing low speed maneuvering in parking lots. Recently began practicing body posturing for high speed “knee drags”
 Difficulty downshifting while front braking without slightly jerking front brake. Humbled. Confidence 6/10

Miles 400-500
 First flat tire. Have not been stringent on checking chain/tires before riding. Fortunately a clogged highway appeared and I realized my rear tire was really squishy!  THIS COULD HAVE ENDED VERY BADLY. DO. YOUR. PRE-RIDE. CHECKS!!!


Miles 500 and over
 Following a regular parking lot practice of emergency braking, whether it be my weight haphazardly placed on the handle bars or not easing off the brake when reaching 0 velocity the weight shifted hard to my left and I dropped the bike slightly scuffing the lower fairing and frame slider.
At this point I am still not comfortable at gauging my bike's ability to take turns at speed.


To all of you brought here by a google search considering doing the same thing, though it is not impossible, unless you are mentally sharp behind the wheel or don't have a tendency to get in accidents, don't have temptations to speed around in cars, (I DD'd a corvette, i would almost never speed. On this motorcycle I am not nearly as good about it),  I'd recommend getting something light, fun, and more comfortable to ride like a Ducati 696 monster or something similarly flickable. This motorcycle is 440 lbs+ and I imagine getting something %10 lighter would make for a similarly fun and more enjoyable. Plus the first gear is so long that it just takes the fun out of low speed take offs and by the time you're in the fun RPM range you are already in the Arrest Me Please speed zone.


Haters welcome and expected.

(Previous post should have been Days 15-18, not 16-19. oh well)

**Mon 8/20 - Wed 8/22**

Hard. Hard hard hard hard.

Just about every single phone call has been painful. Interrupting a stranger's professional day so that I can solicit free services from them, only for them to say no. Over, over, over again.

I've noticed my body physically shying away from the pain of the next call. *Expecting* the pain each time.

Running through my mind repeatedly was the anecdote from Og Mandino's writing:

&gt;In the Orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner. Each is brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. The bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade. Henceforth will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like manner. If I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed.

I've defined myself by this passage for so, so many years. Yes, I'm INTP. Yes, I overthink, overanalyze, search too deep for essential and not practical truth, and misprioritize theoretical solutions over pragmatic ones.

Still, I've always had a habit of using brute force to solve many problems. It stems from a sort of stubbornness - the kind that pushes back indignantly when someone says I can't do something.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I pat myself on the back when I keep charging forward bravely as the bull who won't quit no matter how many times the lance stings.

However...

My habit of charging repeatedly and mindlessly is my own form of cowardice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wasting time. Something with my pitch isn't right. I've tweaked it this way, tweaked it that way...and no one seems to like it.

Am I messing up by saying "I'm looking for a pro bono attorney" right off the bat? Does it make me sound entitled?

Well, I certainly don't want to say it at the end, giving the impression that I'm stringing them along and not forthcoming.

How does it sound when I say "I'm a 26 year old estranged father" in the very first sentence? I liked it, then I thought it sounded bad, so I changed it.

How does it sound when I lead with the fact that I'm a business owner who ***needs*** to file now in order to start over and generate income again? Or does that just turn people off because "business owner" screams "WORK INTENSIVE" to a bankruptcy attorney?

How does it sound when I lead with the fact that I've completed ALL my pre-filing requirements to the best of my ability and knowledge? Does it just make me sound arrogant and dismissive?

As with many things, I must find balance.

&amp;#x200B;

**DRAWING THE LINE**

&amp;#x200B;

I've made two resolutions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Changing gears on my solicitations. ***I don't have many minutes to spare*** \- the guy whose phone I'm using might take it away if I use too many more. So, time to send out emails with my documents.

&amp;#x200B;

It *is* a bit unsettling to think that I'm just liberally sending out my personal info, BUT - bankruptcy filings become public information anyway, so it doesn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

2) **I AM EITHER RETAINING AN ATTORNEY, OR FILING MYSELF BY MONDAY, 8/27**. If I can't find anyone, I'll go pro se (without a lawyer). I will be utterly s\*\*\*ting myself with nerves, I will be in WAAAAAAAAY over my head, but what else am I to do? ***With the path of retreat cut off, the only way by necessity will be to move forward and succeed***.

&amp;#x200B;

**PLAN FOR NEXT TWO DAYS**

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow, Thursday 8/23: My last push at soliciting free services. Spam emails. By the end of tomorrow, **every single bankruptcy attorney in my city will have been solicited by me**. Or else, I have failed to do my part.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday 8/24: Wait an extra day for contact. Meanwhile, I have a few things with my new business I can work on on Friday that I CAN do before filing. Namely, drafting a formal business plan. Btw, I HATE, HATE, HATE business plans. I never EVER wanted to make one for my first business. I always thought of them as a COMPLETE waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT, it WILL be important for me to draft a business plan. I'll be showing why later.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some good stuff**

&amp;#x200B;

* Finished mandatory credit counseling course that's required pre-filing woohoo
* Very blessed for some kind people in my life who have given me so much fellowship and spiritual guidance.
* THANK YOU to all of you who have been reaching out to me privately! I truly appreciate it. Most of you I haven't truly had the chance to get back to yet.
* Today, I felt some warning signs within. The kind that tell you you're about to sink into a deep depression. Why was that a GOOD thing?? Well, I recognized it, and I sought help. I received help. Now, I *actually* have a fighting chance against it. Even one year ago, this is not something I was REMOTELY capable of.
* My knowledge of bankruptcy continues to grow. It's being absorbed like a sponge. I still know NOTHING about the procedures AFTER filing, as it seems there's hardly any information. But, where there are resources, there's a way. I found bkforum, which is awesome. Anecdotal info is often the BEST info.

Also have a friend who's going through some rough shit. Trying to be there as much as I can for her, and grateful for the chance to.

Days 19-21: Changing gears, and possibly filing bankruptcy without an attorney??? (Part 11) [Part 1: Clinically depressed, \~$500k in debt, 26yo estranged father accepts Christ and starts cleaning business - Day 0](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/94b2l3/clinically_depressed_500k_in_debt_26yo_estranged/)

[Part 10: Days 16-19: \[\[FACE REVEAL, WOT???\]\] Discouragement; Tenacity vs Stubbornness; AND, an ambulance trip to the ER](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/98iueb/days_1619_face_reveal_wot_discouragement_tenacity/)

(Previous post should have been Days 15-18, not 16-19. oh well)

**Mon 8/20 - Wed 8/22**

Hard. Hard hard hard hard.

Just about every single phone call has been painful. Interrupting a stranger's professional day so that I can solicit free services from them, only for them to say no. Over, over, over again.

I've noticed my body physically shying away from the pain of the next call. *Expecting* the pain each time.

Running through my mind repeatedly was the anecdote from Og Mandino's writing:

&gt;In the Orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner. Each is brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. The bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade. Henceforth will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like manner. If I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed.

I've defined myself by this passage for so, so many years. Yes, I overthink, overanalyze, search too deep for essential and not practical truth, and misprioritize theoretical solutions over pragmatic ones.

Still, I've always had a habit of using brute force to solve many problems. It stems from a sort of stubbornness - the kind that pushes back indignantly when someone says I can't do something.

​

Yes, I pat myself on the back when I keep charging forward bravely as the bull who won't quit no matter how many times the lance stings.

However...

My habit of charging repeatedly and mindlessly is my own form of cowardice.

​

I'm wasting time. Something with my pitch isn't right. I've tweaked it this way, tweaked it that way...and no one seems to like it.

Am I messing up by saying "I'm looking for a pro bono attorney" right off the bat? Does it make me sound entitled?

Well, I certainly don't want to say it at the end, giving the impression that I'm stringing them along and not forthcoming.

How does it sound when I say "I'm a 26 year old estranged father" in the very first sentence? I liked it, then I thought it sounded bad, so I changed it.

How does it sound when I lead with the fact that I'm a business owner who ***needs*** to file now in order to start over and generate income again? Or does that just turn people off because "business owner" screams "WORK INTENSIVE" to a bankruptcy attorney?

How does it sound when I lead with the fact that I've completed ALL my pre-filing requirements to the best of my ability and knowledge? Does it just make me sound arrogant and dismissive?

An Australian Army Recruit sends home a letter . . . Dear Mum &amp; Dad,

I am well. Hope youse are too. Tell me big brothers Doug and Phil that the Army is better than workin’ on the farm - tell them to get in quick smart before the jobs are all gone! I wuz a bit slow in settling down at first, because ya don’t hafta get outta bed until 6am. But I like sleeping in now, cuz all ya gotta do before brekky is make ya bed and shine ya boots and clean ya uniform. No cows to milk, no calves to feed, no feed to stack - nothin’!! Ya haz gotta shower though, but its not so bad, coz there’s lotsa hot water and even a light to see what ya doing!

At brekky ya get cereal, fruit and eggs but there’s no kangaroo steaks or possum stew like wot Mum makes. You don’t get fed again until noon and by that time all the city boys are dead because we’ve been on a ’route march’ - geez its only just like walking to the windmill in the back paddock!!

This one will kill me brothers Doug and Phil with laughter. I keep getting medals for shootin’ - dunno why. The bullseye is as big as a possum’s bum and it don’t move and it’s not firing back at ya like the Johnsons did when our big scrubber bull got into their prize cows before the Ekka last year! All ya gotta do is make yourself comfortable and hit the target! You don’t even load your own cartridges, they comes in little boxes, and ya don’t have to steady yourself against the rollbar of the roo shooting truck when you reload!

Sometimes ya gotta wrestle with the city boys and I gotta be real careful coz they break easy - it’s not like fighting with Doug and Phil and Jack and Boori and Steve and Muzza all at once like we do at home after the muster.

Turns out I’m not a bad boxer either and it looks like I’m the best the platoon’s got, and I’ve only been beaten by this one bloke from the Engineers - he’s 6 foot 5 and 15 stone and three pick handles across the shoulders and as ya know I’m only 5 foot 7 and eight stone wringin’ wet, but I fought him till the other blokes carried me off to the boozer.

I can’t complain about the Army - tell the boys to get in quick before word gets around how good it is.

Your loving daughter,

Sheila

Car dies when turning on A/C and lose RPM when WOT (Wide Open Throttle) while idling Would this be symptoms of bad (water) gas or clogged fuel filter or both?

If it's not bad gas then I plan on pouring in sta-bil and fil the tank up and replace the filter + DIY troubleshoot in about 6 months when I move out.

If it's bad gas with water, then I should get it running asap to prevent rusts and other unknown interior damages, correct?

Car is 2003 mustang GT (35k miles) and has been sitting outside for almost a year, though I try to start it up and idle for ~15 minutes every 2-3 weeks (I was ignorant about sta-bil and other additives back then).

I can't really work on it because it's sitting in apartment parking lot and won't start up at all at the moment.

Any inputs would be appreciated.

Trying to pass smog (Aren’t we all)

Bought a 01 330ci a couple months back. Super clean but had vacuum leaks galore and a few oil leaks.

I had been planning on getting a fake smog because the car had a check engine light but I have gotten the light to go away (when I cleared the codes) and now the CEL has yet to come back on.

However I still have 2 pending fault codes (p0301,p0302) which is misfire in cylinders 1 and 2.

The misfire is hardly noticeable will only come in after about 20 minutes of driving then sitting at idle for a couple of minutes it starts to have a very minor vibration and I can hear a cylinder missing.

I bought the car with problems, and most (if not all) of those have been fixed, including;
-valve cover gasket, all grommets on vc bolts
-oil filter housing gasket
-upper + lower intake boots
-secondary air pump vacuum line
-all new spark plugs

And so I am not sure how to get this code to go away when doing the valve cover gasket I have had misfires in cyl-1,2,3, and 4 during this process of elimination and have tested+ swapped coil packs to where I am pretty sure coils aren’t the issue.

Oh and exhaust smells like rotten eggs almost sulfurish, fills nostrils after WOT.

My only thought is that it could be injectors or clogged cats, (maybe bank 1 more clogged than bank 2, causing the misfire?) or maybe the oil separator and lines running to and from?

(TL:DR; need to smog car, misfire cyl- 1&amp;2, fixed most of common causes, symptoms include very intermittent misfiring during idle after driving for 20+ min, and smelly exhaust)


Any help is appreciated :))

First Oil change: Two-Stroke Gear Oil? Weight? (small old bike) I have a 1971 Yamaha JT1-J, 60cc air cooled, got it with 800miles.
Pretty sure the origonal oil is still in the gear-box; it's creamy white...(fish oil?)

1. Should I use some kind of fluid to flush it?
2. What oil/oil weight should I replace it with? (Spring/Summer riding, nothing cooler than a windbreaker.)
3. Mostly WOT riding on the streets.

**Newark International Airport, New Jersey**

New Jersey is the armpit of the eastern seaboard, there’s simply no way around it, folks. Despite being known as the “Garden State,” there is actually zero proof that Jersey has a single forest or major green area within its small borders. The state is also home to the New Jersey turnpike, one of the single most Jewish inventions since Steam updated its chat feature, and one that still manages to fuck you over even if you’re just driving through Jersey. And don’t think for one second that it’s just the state’s features that make it easily the worst state in the union. The people themselves are pure toxic, although can you really blame them for it since over 45 percent of them are inbred? That’s right, people, New Jersey has the highest rate of incest in the United States, even beating those bastions of cousin-love Mississippi and Alabama. They’re also on average five times greasier than the average American citizen, a statistic which is surely responsible for the (fortunately) late churl Jon Von Jersey, who once poorly battled against the anti-Tribal avenger Duke and the three under-Brains, who are probably now just known as the Big Brains with the demise of Barnes. All that was rotten, all that was wrong, and all that was bad about New Jersey was amplified in Newark International, a rotten burgh in the heart of a sea of rotten burghs. If you wanted to use the toilet, it would be out of order. If you wanted to catch some shut-eye before your flight, you’d find the lounge populated by strangely loud mouth-breathers, and if you wanted to buy a can of Folka-Cola, the vending machine would take your cash and refuse you your beverage, as Alex Jones and Ricky Nelson were finding out first hand. The wokesters were standing in front of a vending machine filled with all sorts of (poor quality) drinks. They had put a buck-thirty in it, and now the arm responsible for collecting their order was hovering - stalling even - over the top of the white and red packaging of a Folka-Cola can. It had been for at least a minute.

**NELSON:** Goddammit Alex, it feels like this machine’s mocking us.

**JONES:** I’m gettin’ the same friggin feeling, Ricky. It’s like I can feel it’s goddamn soulless beaty robot eyes staring back at us, like it thinks it’s better than us. Does it feel good being in control, you piece of mechanical crap?! DO YOU GET OFF ON KEEPING A COUPLE ‘A’ FRIGGIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS FROM THEIR FOLKACOLA, HUH?!?? WHO PROGRAMMED YOU THIS WAY?? WAS IT ZUCKERBERG? IS YOUR NAME ZUCKERBOT 9,000 OR SOMETHING QUEER LIKE THAT???!?! ANSWER ME!

The vending machine, being a vending machine, said nothing. Jones, being woke on this sort of thing, decided to give it a good kick, hoping that it might reveal its secrets under pressure.

**JONES:** WHO’S YOUR MASTER?!??

Again no response. Before Jones could employ some more enhanced interrogation techniques on the machine, an airport employee came walking up to them, likely alerted by his screaming.

**AIRCHURL:** Excuse me, sir, is something wrong?

The Infowars host turned around and stared at the employee, who we feel like we should probably mention was a hispanic woman, before answering her.

**JONES:** I don’t know, you tell me, ma’am. IS IT NOT BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY’RE FRIGGIN LISTENING TO OUR EVERY WORD AND SELLING OFF OUR GODDAMN DATA TO SILICON VALLEY ANDROIDS FOR PENNIES ON THE FRIGGIN DOLLAR? AIN’T IT BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY’RE FEEDING US ALL THIS GARBAGE PASSED OFF AS FOOD AND THEN WHEN WE GET SICK FROM IT ALL THEY STILL MAKE MORE GODDAMN MONEY OFF OF US?? IS THAT ENOUGH, SOROS??! DO YOU NEED MORE FROM US? IS THAT NOT GOOD ENOUGH? OH, WHAT WAS THAT, NOW YOU’RE GONNA MAKE IT SO WE CAN’T EVEN ENJOY AN ICE COLD CAN OF FOLKA FRIGGIN COLA!? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO LIVE AND LET LIVE, YOU GODDAMN CONTROL FREAKS??!?!?? NOW IT’S FRIGGIN LIVE AND LET DIE OF HEART FAILURE AT 45! ALL I’M ASKING IS TO ENJOY ONE CAN OF UNTAINTED FIZZY GOODNESS, FOR FUCK’S SAKE! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? DO I NEED A FRIGGIN GOVERNMENT PERMIT TO USE A VENDING MACHINE NOW OR SOMETHING??! DO YOU NEED A COLLECT A STOOL SAMPLE NEXT, OR PROBE MY FRIGGIN ASSHOLE BEFORE I CAN INSERT YOUR WORTHLESS COINS INTO YOUR ROBOT KILLING MACHINES? BECAUSE I’LL COMPLY WITH YOUR STUPID REQUESTS IF THAT’S WHAT IT TAKES. I’LL BE A GOOD LITTLE COG IN YOUR GODDAMN CONTROL MATRIX IF THAT’S WHAT IT’LL TAKE FOR THIS FUCKING MACHINE TO WORK! RAHHHH STAY BACK, GET THE FUCK BACK! DON’T TOUCH ME, SHE-DEVIL, I’VE GOT RIGHTS! GAH, I BET YOUR NAME’S NOT EVEN FRIGGIN..

Jones squinted at the terrified airport worker’s nametag.

**JONES:** - I BET YOUR NAME’S NOT EVEN ROSA, YOU WALKING FLESH-BAG. I BET YOU’RE THEIR NEWEST MODEL, I BET YOU’RE RELATED TO THIS GODDAMN MACHINE AND YOU COULD SENSE IT WAS BEING EXPOSED SO YOU CAME OVER HERE TO FRIGGIN BAIL IT OUT, IS THAT RIGHT?? HUH, IS IT? I SEE ALL YOU PEOPLE. YOU DON’T GET THROUGH FRIGGIN BORDER CONTROL WITHOUT THEM INJECTING YA WITH NEUROCONTROL PSYCHOTICS! BY THE TIME THEY GAVE ALL OF YOU CITIZENSHIP, I BETCHA TEN BUCKS YOU WERE VOTING DEMOCRAT DOWN THE GODDAMN TICKET, I BETCHA TURNED THE TV ON EVERY TIME CLINTON CAME ON THE SCREEN, AND I BETCHA DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHY! GOD, YOU MAKE ME SICK! YOU PIECE OF PUKE! YOU MAKE ME GODDAMN SICK!

Overcome with rage, Jones grabbed the vending machine by the base, and tossed it onto the ground, cracking the glass and allowing countless cans of Pepsi, Coke, Fanta, Dr. Pepper, Pepsi Max, Pepsi, Sprite, Folka-Cola, and Pepsi to roll across the ground. As Jones counted the fleeing cans of soda, he came to the realisation that PepsiCo products outnumbered the other soft-drinks almost 2 to 1. Rosa had fled, so there was no one to question but the Lord Almighty.

**JONES:** GODDAMN, WHY DO THEY HAVE SO MUCH FRIGGIN PEPSI?! IS IT BECAUSE THEY’RE MAKING IT WITH FRIGGIN PLANNED PARENTHOOD, UNDERGROUND INCUBATOR BABIES, HUH?

Jones and Nelson were standing at the end of a long corridor, away from the main section of the airport and close to several departure gates. Despite this, a small crowd had overheard Alex’s shouting from the top of the corridor and come down to investigate. Many of them - specifically the overweight, children, and less obvious diabetics - had picked up cans of pepsi and were now eagerly slurping its sugary contents.

**JONES:** WAKE UP, YOU FRIGGIN SHEEP! YOU’RE DRINKING GODDAMN EMULSIFIED INTESTINES OF BABIES! AHHHHHH! WAKE UP! STOP FRIGGIN DRINKING OUR KIDS! STOP DRINKING OUR KIDS, YOU GODDAMN SATANIC THRALL CANNIBAL PIECES OF TRASH! STOP DRINKING OUR GODDAMN KIDS!

Snarling and filled with righteous anger, Jones took a step towards the modern-day version of the Donner Party, only for Nelson to shout a warning at him. A group of men in deep blue shirts were coming running down the other end of the hallway towards them. They had tasers in holsters on their pants and shoulder patches that read ‘TSA’, leading Jones and Nelson to conclude that they were agents of the TSA.

**NELSON:** It’s the fucking Gestapo, Alex! They want to take us to a goddamn CIA black site for sure!

**JONES:** RAHHH, GET BACK YOU CULTISTS!

As the TSA agents advanced towards them, Jones ducked down and picked up a few cans of Fanta that were scattered around him, which he then hurled at the approaching agents.

**JONES:** HOW’S THAT FOR AGENT ORANGE, YOU FUCKS??! A LITTLE TASTE OF YOUR OWN FRIGGIN MEDICINE!

**TSA AGENT #1:** Someone call for backup, this guy’s unhinged!

One of the agents reached for their walkie-talkie, but Jones sent a can of the orange soda at them which, thanks to his career as a football player in high school, managed to hit the communication device and knock it off the agent’s belt.

**TSA AGENT #2:** He’s making a mockery of our agency, let’s cuff him!

**TSA AGENT #3:** Um, since when did we carry handcuffs, sargeant?

**TSA AGENT #2:** It’s a goddamn expression! Pin him to a post or something, tase him for all I care!

One of TSA agents pulled his black-and-yellow taser out, ready to deliver 300 volts of shock therapy to the Infowars host. Seeing that the situation had escalated, Jones and Nelson took off running through the horde of Pepsi-drinking man eaters, throwing cans of Fanta behind them in order to trip up the pursuing agents.

**NELSON:** If they take us, die before you break!

Nelson and Jones exploded from the corridor into the weird, wild world of airport stores outside it, and immediately melted into the crowd of thousands of passengers wheeling their suitcases around the floor and talking in hundred different languages. If the TSA were to find them without the aid of surveillance systems, it would be a modern miracle. Contextless pings, dings, and dongs rang out over the PA system at random intervals, departures and arrivals were announced, and people chatted. After milling around the packed ground floor for a few minutes, the coalition against 9/11 found itself heading up an elevator towards Mr. Teriyaki’s sushi bar, which was actually owned and operated by a white guy called Paul. Although Jones was somewhat distrusting of elevators, this one didn’t break down in the middle of going up as he often feared, and the two soon stepped out into the middle of Mr. Teriyaki’s. Jones and Nelson headed over to the bar itself, and took a seat in between some random businessmen with those bluetooth earpieces that make you look like a massive prick and an obese tourist couple from somewhere in the Midwest, who were seemingly in the middle of some passionate discussion. Let’s see what Mr. and Mrs. Brown had to say, because let’s face it, there’s a good chance that’s what their names were.

**MR. BROWN:** Well, I’ll be damned, Susan, that was some excellent sushi.

**MRS. BROWN:** You betcha, dear. Heh, I almost felt like I was sitting at a restaurant in Shanghai when I had that sake earlier.

**MR. BROWN:** I mean, really. You just can’t beat the authentic Japanese experience, can ya?

**MRS. BROWN:** I agree with my husband!

Well, that’s enough of that business, let’s get back to the **real** stars of the show.

**NELSON:** What the hell are these people eating, Alex? Looks like little car tires with green stuff in them. Seems suspicious to me.

**JONES:** You mean friggin sushi?

**NELSON:** Yeah.. that.

**JONES:** I’ve never been the biggest fan of the stuff, but are you tellin’ me you don’t know what sushi is?? It’s raw fish, Ricky! And seaweed, lots of friggin seaweed too.

**NELSON:** They’re serving up raw fish here?! That sounds like the kinda crap they’d give those poor kids in Africa to soften them up before injecting them with Bill Gates’ AIDS vaccines! And seaweed?? This is too weird for me, Alex.

**JONES:** It’s not just here, brother. This is what people over in Japan, and China too I’d imagine, this is what they eat for friggin breakfast, lunch, AND dinner over there.

**NELSON:** Goddamn...Mao did a number on those commies, Alex. He’s got them working in the fields and not even cooking their own food. I bet they’re gonna be eating rice off the goddamn stem before long!

They actually already were. Thanks to the murder of Xi Jinping by Shinzo Abe - who was also now known as Mr. No, but that was down to opaque asiatic memes and poor translation -, communist China had collapsed into a series of warring states which were regularly devastated by plague and famine. In some of these regions, the population had begun eating plants while they were still mostly in the ground. This had led to people in the West developing the term “dirtmen” as a new racial slur for the Chinese. Anyway, that’s the reason why no one hears from the People’s Republic of China these days. Bleak, isn’t it? Well, you did ask. Oh, you didn’t? Well, you got told anyway. You fucking dirtman.

**JONES:** Forget the Chinese people, that’s what the Tribe are gonna have us eating if we don’t stop this 9/11 crap they’ve got cooking. It’ll be nothing but friggin grass and stems, and maybe seeds on Fridays if we’re good, obedient little slaves. That’s our friggin future the way things are headed. Fuck..

Jones, sensing another outburst, promptly reached into his pocket and product a stress ball that he had been ordered to carry around ever since his last visit to the doctor’s office, when the doctors informed him that he suffered from extremely high blood pressure due to stress. The radio host closed his eyes and gave the ball a good few squeezes before putting it back in his pocket. Crisis averted.

**JONES:** I’m sorry, I apologise. Shouldn’t talk like this in public.

**NELSON:** It’s alright, Alex. I can’t blame you for getting fired up over this shit. Sometimes when I’m lying in bed I’ll think of what these globalist fucks are doing to the human race and just start beating the shit out of it, pretending like it’s Kissinger or someone.

Apparently this was the last straw for Mr. Brown, who turned towards Nelson and politely tapped him on the shoulder.

**NELSON:** ...Get your friggin repitilian ha- oh, fuck, my bad. I uh, I didn’t see you there. Is there a problem?

**MR. BROWN:** Yeah, there is.

A few seconds of silence followed this.

**NELSON:** What’s the problem?

**MR. BROWN:** Your vocabulary, pal. Why do you have to go around using so many curse words like that?

**JONES:** It’s his goddamn first amendment right, sir.

**NELSON:** It’s my first amendment right to express myself any way I choose.

**MR. BROWN:** Could ya just take it down a notch, buddy? And if we’re on the subject of the first amendment, I should point out it’s also my right to do the same thing.

**JONES:** What the hell’d you just say to him, you friggin maggot?! Why do you care so goddamn much about what words he uses? WHY THE HELL IS EVERYONE AT THIS AIRPORT SO FRIGGIN NOSEY?!! YOU DON’T SEE ME INTERRUPTING YOU DURING YOUR MEAL AND TELLING YOU TO STOP SHOVING THAT POISONOUS CRAP DOWN YOUR THROAT, DO YOU?? I DIDN’T THINK SO, SO WHY ARE YOU GIVING RICKY HERE SUCH A GODDAMN HARD TIME OVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HUH??

Jones began rapidly squeezing his stress ball, perhaps timing it with the palpitations of his red-blooded, american heart.

**JONES:** This is a family establishment, I shouldn’t be talking like this. I’m sorry. I apologise. I shouldn’t even be here today…

**NELSON:** It’s probably the goddamn chemtrails destroying your mind and forcing you into a berzerk state. It’s Monsanto doing this. GMOs, man, they’re not just working on goddamn plants, they class us as organisms too, Alex.

**MR. BROWN:** What, so now you have a problem with Monsanto too? I’ll have you know I’m employed with the Minnesota subsidiary of Monsanto, pal, and those conspiracies you’re spewing about us are complete malarky, buddy. That’s right, our GMO products are entirely safe for consumption, and in fact, I’d wager they’re probably safer than the non-GMO alternative. So maybe before you go spreading dangerous disinformation you should do some research. That’s just my take, though, fellas.

**JONES:** Do some research? Oh, man.. I’VE DONE MY FRIGGIN RESEARCH. I’VE DONE MORE RESEARCH INTO MORE THINGS THAN YOU COULD EVEN IMAGINE, YOU GODDAMN CORPORATE STOOGE. AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR RICKY, TOO. WE KNOW ALL THE TRICKS IN YOUR NWO PLAYBOOK AND LET ME TELL YA: WE AIN’T IMPRESSED. I’VE BEEN TO THE GROVE, FOR CRYIN’ OUT LOUD. I’VE SEEN WHAT THEY DO WHEN THE CAMERAS AREN’T ROLLIN,’ AND LET ME TELL YA SOMETHING, IT AIN’T PRETTY! FUCK, I SHOULDN’T EVEN BE BLAMIN’ YOU, YOU PROBABLY DON’T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS CRAP. YOU’RE PROBABLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ESTABLISHMENT TOTEM POLE RIGHT NEXT TO THE PARKLAND CRISIS ACTORS AND THE FBI SPOOKS AT WACO. THEY DON’T FEED YOU SHIT, THEY JUST BOSS YOU AROUND. IN FACT, I FEEL FRIGGIN BAD FOR YOU, AND HOW MUCH OF A TOOL YOU ARE. THOSE TSA AGENTS FROM EARLIER ARE PROBABLY MORE CUED IN ON THE NWO’S PLANS THAN YOU. YOU’RE NOTHING, YOU’RE FRIGGIN DIRT TO THESE GLOBALISTS! AND THEY WALK ALL OVER YOU, JUST LIKE DIRT. WHEN THE FUCK WILL PEOPLE LIKE YOU GROW A SPINE AND STOP BEING PLAYED LIKE GODDAMN FIDDLES BY THESE PEOPLE?!?! WHERE THE HELL ARE YOUR BALLS!?! IS YOUR WIFE HOLDING THEM IN HER FRIGGIN PURSE OR SOMETHING FOR WHEN YOU NEED ‘EM, OR WHAT?? FUCK..

As Jones raged against the satanic lettuces and cabbages pumped out by Monsanto on the regular, he came out of his seat and slowly edged towards Mr. Brown, eyes bulging and veins throbbing. By the end of his tirade, he was practically shouting into Brown’s face, and was bent down to face him.

**MR. BROWN:** You need to back up, buddy.

**JONES:** What, can you not handle the friggin’ truth? You and your goddamn wife need to learn that you’re doing nothing but sucking off the goddamn NWO every time you clock into work! You friggin drone! You’re nothing but an ant!

**MR. BROWN:** I’m warning you, pal, don’t drag my wife into this! I’ll.. I won’t stand for that, buddy! You’re crossing the line there!

**JONES:** Oh, I’m crossing the line? What about the goddamn line you cross every day when you pump kids full of cancer and mind-control drugs, huh?! What about that friggin line? Or are you so sick and twisted that you don’t give a shit about corrupting and murdering children as long as you can eat your goddamn GMO superAIDS ebola sushi????!

**MR. BROWN:** Buddy -

**JONES:** YOU ARE A SERVANT OF SATAN! YOU SUCK ON THE DEVIL’S TEATS, YOU PIECE OF FILTH! YOU GODDAMN HOBGOBLIN!

It seemed that Mr. Brown was either intimidated by Jones, or terrified by his hobgoblin-status being exposed to the entire restaurant, because he immediately turned both pale and to his wife, who seemed to have something to say anyway.

**MRS. BROWN:** Honey, let’s just leave, these people are crazy! It’s not worth dealing with them, no matter how good this sushi may be!

**MR. BROWN:** I agree with my wife.

The Browns, who were probably a touch browner than they had been before they entered the restaurant, hurriedly got up and left, pulling suitcases along behind them.

**NELSON:** Oh, so we’re insane for *not* wanting cancer?! *We’re* insane? I think you’re insane! You people are damn sociopathic monsters, and lying freaks! You’re calling us insane? You’re crazy! You’re both goddamn loony!

The Browns disappeared out of eyeshot, glancing over their shoulders to make sure that they weren’t being followed.

**JONES:** Goddammit...some people have no friggin manners.

**NELSON:** I hear ya, Alex. But I don’t think manners are into it, I think they’re goddamn disruption agents. They wanted to prevent us from planning. They were sent here directly by the New World Order to eat up our time and prevent us from stopping 9/11!

**JONES:** Holy hell, the Tribe’s goddamn crafty. It’s like playing chess against one of those friggin Google deep-state FEMA-protocol elimination list supercomputers. They’re always a step ahead. They’re trying to trick us into defeating ourselves. And you know this is all coming from a 4th dimensional perspective. They’re receiving orders from entities like Baphomet, like Satan, like the goddamn Watchers, who know what they have to do to win. Who know the friggin plays they gotta make...we have to be unpredictable, or these goddamn Satanists will lure us into trap after friggin trap!

**NELSON:** Predictable, that’s for damn sure. That’s the only way to shake these fucks off our tail. We’ve gotta get real weird with it, Alex. Like back in ‘Nam when Danny boy stripped naked, covered himself in his own shit and ran into a VC camp. They definitely weren’t expecting that. You know, sometimes I wonder what he’s up to nowadays.

Daniel “Danny boy” Roberts had actually been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder shortly after returning home to Kansas after the recent Vietnam War. Although he tried his best to readjust to civilian life, the disease ended up getting the best of him one Fourth of July and, mistaking some fireworks for enemy gunshots, ran out of his house with an army-issue M14 and gunned down the neighbour kids who were shooting off roman candles nextdoor. After a lengthy shoot-out with the police, Danny boy was finally apprehended and carted off to prison, where he would only last a mere five weeks before hanging himself in his cell with some towels tied together at the end. Anyway, I hope that answered your question, Ricky.

**JONES:** I heard he was doing good.

We heard otherwise. Is *this* the real info war?

**JONES:** But enough about him, we need to talk. The Tribe’s hijacking two planes out of here, United Airlines 93 and and American Airlines 77. First one, I think they’re gonna friggin ram it into McMahon. The second one’s probably headed for the goddamn Pentagon or Capitol Hill. I hate to say this, Ricky...but we can’t be in two places at once. It ain’t friggin feasible.

**NELSON:** There’s two of us, though. Two people, two planes, two targets.

**JONES:** I wish it was that goddamn simple, brother, but the way this has to be done, I think I might need to crash that goddamn plane, and when I do that, I’m gonna need to bail out right after. That means I’ll need you in the air ready to catch me after I jump. That’s the only way we’re stopping that friggin thing from going right into the White House.

**NELSON:** I’m right with you on swooping you up in my bird, but I don’t know about the crashing part. I don’t think I can stomach killing anymore innocents, man. Not after My Lai…

**JONES:** Don’t worry, Ricky, we’re gonna avoid that crap if we can, but you gotta friggin understand that this is more important than a few hundred lives. This is the human race’s last friggin hope on the line here, and we’ve gotta make sure this crap doesn’t happen, even if that means a couple hundred people dying in the process. Plus, let’s not forget that most of these folks are flying business anyway, so there’s a good chance they’re in on the goddamn thing.

It was, and Nelson knew it. The fate of the human race was to be determined by winner takes all, and he and Jones had long ago realised that they would sacrifice anything - themselves, their families, their towns - so that the species could march on. So that one day, children could smile without being ‘innocent’ or ‘naive’. So that one day everyone could be free, free from anyone that would ever oppress them. This was the battle they had started to fight all those years ago in Vietnam, and they would not desert the field at the first whiff of gunpowder.

**NELSON:** I understand, Alex.

**JONES:** I’m not asking you to like it, Ricky. I hate it myself. I goddamn hate it, but it’s gotta happen.

**NELSON:** I know. I friggin know. Some day it won’t just be the birds that fly free, brother. I believe that with all my heart, and I know we’re gonna do what we gotta so that can be the future.

**JONES:** People are probably gonna revile us for making the judgement call we might have to, Ricky. If I take that plane down, the fucking MSM, Bill Gates-Zuckerberg-Bin axis media, and the whole lot, are gonna friggin say: “*Oh, that mean Alex Jones! He doesn’t have the RIGHT to do that! That’s not his call to make!*”. It’ll happen to you too.

**NELSON:** They can say whatever they want, brother.

**JONES:** They can, and they’re gonna. I’m not boasting, I don’t boast - but heroes don’t get celebrated in their lifetime. Some day people are gonna thank us for this.

**NELSON:** And even if they don’t, we gotta do it.

**JONES:** It’s the right thing to do. The only thing protecting us now’s God and those friggin rocket pods on your bird, baby!

As Jones and Nelson chatted, not sparing any kind of care for the people around them that were listening - not that they could really PROCESS what they were hearing in the first place - the tannoy system rung out with a smooth, emotionless female voice.

**AIRPORT:** United Airlines Flight 93 to San Francisco International Airport is now boarding at Gate 20. United Airlines Flight 93 to San Francisco International Airport is now boarding at Gate 20.

Before the announcer had even finished her first sentence, Jones was rushing out the door with Nelson hot on his tails. Though neither of them had talked about it, a non-verbal consensus had been reached: McMahon was more important than the Pentagon. The President represented the spearhead of the anti-Tribal movement. The Generals in the Pentagon could be replaced, junior officers could be promoted. Scaramucci could not fill Vincent Kennedy McMahon’s shoes, and the cause could not sustain the blow that would force him to try. Within minutes, they had arrived outside the entrance of United Airlines 93, where departure staff were already processing the lines of waiting passengers. Men, women, children, black, brown, white, blue (They probably had methemoglobinemia, but they could have just been rejected members of the Blue Man Group or the live-action Smurfs’ tribute act, the Blue Gnome Group), people of and from every corner of America and the seven continents were here. Some of them were glum, some happy, some apprehensive, but all of them, Jones knew, were living and breathing human beings, with hearts and souls like his own. As he and Nelson stood at the end of the corridor and watched them slowly file on, Alex Jones began to cry. Not wailing, not crying pathetically, but a trickle of salt water out of his left eye, the sort that let us know that underneath everything, there was a breakable man in there.

**JONES:** Ricky, all these folks...they don’t know what’s gonna happen. Goddammit...I wanna just friggin shout out and warn them, I gotta just tell them not to get on this friggin hell-plane.

**NELSON:** Alex, you can’t.

**JONES:** I’ve gotta do it, brother.

Jones took a step towards the passengers, but before he could get in another, Nelson grabbed him around the chest and hauled him back towards a wall.

**NELSON:** I get it, man, but we just talked about this. This is the only way to stop the globalists from re-applying the international conditioning, and the New World Order’s gotta take over this friggin plane somehow. They have goddamn agents in there. Some of those people are vampiric ogres in human form. You warn the rest of them...those pale purple satanists will hear too, and they’ll know the plan’s been rumbled. It’s those people, or it’s all people.

**JONES:** Goddammit....GOD DAMN YOU SATAN! YOU GODDAMN HORNED BASTARD! YOU HAIRY SULFURIC GOAT! GOD’LL GET YOU EVENTUALLY! GOD’LL STRIKE YOU DOWN! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

Jones slammed his fist into the wall and pushed out of Nelson’s grasp, walking towards the line as a sadder figure than he’d been previously. Thanks to the music playing over the airport intercom system - by noted rapper and child molestor Lil Ying Yang Thuggy Boi - no one in the line could hear him, not even the young couple in front of him. As they marched slowly towards their deaths, Jones began to wonder if they might be agents of the Tribe. There was no way of knowing for sure, and it wasn’t like the NWO were going to send George Soros to hijack the flight in-person. Before Jones could come up with a conclusive answer on whether or not the couple in front of him were on the payroll of the tribe, they marched off towards the gate, having shown their tickets to the uniformed airport employee standing next to the front desk at the terminal. The employee, this time an exceptionally boring-looking man in his 40s, motioned for Jones to step forward.

**MAN:** Ticket and ID please.

Jones fumbled around in his pockets for his driver’s license, before holding it up along with the boarding pass. The man, who would probably go home and kill himself later, nodded and motioned for him to proceed through the gate. As he passed through the gate and into the cabin of the plane itself, Jones glanced down at his ticket for the seat number, which was 9A in case you needed to know which seat he was sitting in in order to properly envision things, you freak.  walked down the left aisle of the cabin for a short while, before finally arriving at seat 9A, which happened to be the one by the window. We aren’t sure if that’s a good thing or not. Do people generally prefer sitting by the window or the aisle? In either case, Jones got settled in his seat. Feeling uncharacteristically nervous, Jones glanced out the window onto the tarmac, and then glanced around to the seat beside him to see an extremely unwelcome personage inhabiting it: None other than the noted “entertainment news” show host John Oliver. Oliver beamed at Jones, displaying his awful teeth and terrible breath. Jones did not return the favour.

**OLIVER:** Corr blimey, if it int me ole so-in-so Alex Jones! Uncova any crisis actas lately, guv? Find any bloomin’ gay frogs? Wot about a lesbian crocodile?

**JONES:** I don’t...I’m not gonna talk to you, buddy.

**OLIVER:** Oi mate, don’t worry, oi ‘aven’t sacrificed any babies at Bohemian Grove or nuffin’! I thot you’d ‘ave more fiah than this, guv. Wot’s the matta’? The illuminati turn your cat into a Mexican, mate? Or is mum a lizard now?

Mum, for those of you that don’t know, was what Americans thought that British people called the Queen. In reality, they called her the Queen. This impression stems from horrifically ignorant individuals being unable to decipher the accent of members of the upper-class who refer to her as “Ma’am” on occasion, and assuming that everyone believes she birthed the nation through her own ancient vagina.

**JONES:** Look, stop breathing on me, globalist. Your breath smells like friggin saltpeter. I don’t need your goddamn demonic vibrations, especially not today.

**OLIVER:** Saltpeter? That’s a new’un, innit?

Before Jones could respond and tell them that there was an entire hierarchy of demonic scents, which he clearly knew due to being a satanist globalist and et cetera, Oliver’s phone began to ring. In keeping with his status as a shucking-and-jiving pet Briton for the New York liberal west-east coast elite, his ringtone was Queen’s cover of God Save the Queen, which we choose not to link. Oliver picked it up and immediately answered it, meaning it wasn’t his wife.

**OLIVER:** ‘Ello guv?...Corr...blimey...you wot?..blimey...got it, me old duck.

Oliver gulped and put the phone down, before climbing out of his seat and power-walking off the plane without so much as a goodbye to his conversational partner. Rude. Anyway, sit back, relax, strap in, and pay attention to your probably hot stewardess. This...is your pilot speaking.

**Earl’s Court, London**

No, this isn’t the same Earl. We aren’t going to catch up with him, not yet anyway. According to our friends over at Wikipedia, the Earl after whom this particular borough in London was named wasn’t even a single person like our Earl. In fact, Earl’s court - again, according to Wikipedia - was apparently named after the Vere family, the Earls of Oxford, who lorded over this particular patch of land back in the olden days. You know, back when MEN were MEN and WOMEN were WOMEN, when the butter was hand-churned and there weren’t any black people. We’re talking about the Middle Ages here, folks. Anyway, the origin of the name isn’t particularly relevant for our purposes. In fact, the court itself wasn’t all that relevant except for that it was currently where John McDonnell and the international beauties of the Small and Folkish Girls Contest were currently running through in their journey towards “sickerhood,” in the words of Morrissey. The street that they were heading down was a narrow, leafy one, dominated by houses smaller than their massive price-tags would suggest. McDonnell’s gun was still drawn. The girls were still womanly and thus scared. They had not yet encountered anything resembling a Tribal soldier or Trashman, but the streets were oddly deserted. As he continued to sprint down the empty street, McDonnell suddenly noticed the lack of other footsteps behind his own, and turned around to find that all the womenfolk had stopped following him. Where were they, then? The answer was far less mysterious than you might have thought. The women were actually only a few feet down the street from him, standing before a storefront and peering in. Frustrated, McDonnell marched back over to them and tapped one of them on the shoulder.

**MCDONNELL:** What the fuck are you girls doing? Don’t tell me you’ve fallen prey to these capitalist advertising tactics.

**MISS AUSTRIA:** But herr McDonnell, just vait until you see ze shiny things! Look at zose earrings, are zey not glamorous?

**MCDONNELL:** There’s nothing glamorous about materialism, especially not when the fucking city’s under attack. We need to get going.

The girls seemed hesitant to actually go anywhere. They had found a store that they liked, and such was the nature of their gender that they wished to stay there for several hours, in order to review the baubles and trinkets. McDonnell knew how to deal with them, though.

**MCDONELL:** We’ve got women’s gulags too, you know. Up in York. And they’re every bit as bloody nasty as the re-education camps we send the big capitalists too. I made sure of that myself. Maybe we could pay one of them a visit.

This got their attention. Well, those of them that knew enough English to understand what McDonnell was threatening them with.

**MISS TURKEY:** Will the gamer be there…?

**MCDONNELL:** Every day.

**MISS TURKEY:** We leave, ladies. We will shop another day. Not to-day.. I do not want to meet the Gamer in actual life, it is bad enough in a computer.

In actuality, she had already met the ‘Gamer’ in real life. The particular iteration of the Joker troll that she was faced with was none other than her own brother...yeah...let that sink in.

**MCDONNELL:** Yes, we do leave. The safehouse isn’t much further. It’s closer than the gulag, anyway.

Although they really wanted to stay and take in all that a random store had to offer, the girls also didn’t want to be shipped to a labour camp either, so they pried themselves away from the window and followed McDonnell further up the road. The group walked for a few more blocks, with McDonnell periodically glancing over his shoulder to make sure he hadn’t lost the small and folkish girls to another jewelry store, before finally arriving outside a low-key looking apartment building with a simple metal door. The Anglish Geldlord gave the door a few good knocks, which we will point out were far stronger than any knock the womenfolk around him could have given. After nearly a minute, the door was cracked open slightly from the inside, allowing a bald, rubby man to stick his head out.

**MAN:** Oh, for christ’s sake, comrade McDonnell, I was about ready to stick the barrel of my AK out the door and gun down whoever was knocking. Thought you were one of those fucking tribalists they’ve got roaming the streets around here. Well, I’m glad it didn’t come to that anyway. Why don’t you come in on, mate?

**MCDONNELL:** I’m afraid I’ve got other business to attend to, but I was wondering if these girls could lay low here while things cool off out there, comrade.

**COMMIE:** Sure thing, comrade. Our doors are always open to any fellow anti-bourgeoisie fighters, especially pretty ones.

He definitely wasn’t going to take advantage of them sexually!

**MCDONNELL:** Great, thanks, I’ll repay you later on, comrade, the next time we read the writings of Chairman Mao together.

What in the ass? -Another teenage lowlife complaining on reddit about their personal life So, for the last 5 yeas, Ive been looking for the oh so legendary and mythical “meme queens”. Obviously I have internet friends that are meme queens but that really doesn’t count... anyway, a new freshman came into my school that started hanging out with the memelords clique and I thought to my self “This must be the answer”.
So I asked her our as any memelord should... and I got shafted really hard (no shes not a trap I swear)
So throughout the course of the next two weeks she called us perverted for listening to lil barnacle, until eventually she turned around and asked one of my best friends for “nudes or porn”.
So like any normal human would or should, I confronted her about it and this is how it went down
Me: “Ey why’d you do that, I think it only makes sense we break up”
Her: “Your overreacting and your a jerk, I was high so its ok I did that”
Me: “wot”

The end :3

Tifu by suggesting to watch shrek in class Sorry if this was not good also sorry for formatting on mobile at the moment.


So I was in highschool when this happened probably year 8 or 9.
Backstory to this:
So in my school we had the normal kids, weird kids, cool kids and the "roadmen" (they talked in roadman slang often). I was a normal kid and was friends with some of the cool kids but
I hated the roadmen dearly.

So I was in religious studies and there was about 3 or 4 days till the end of the school year everyone was happy we didn't really do any work. We had a supply the supply had Netflix on the computer and asked what we wanted to watch so there was some suggestions and then I said to my two friends what if I say Shrek (there was this girl I liked and her friends and her liked Shrek so I thought I could tell her and she would be happy   it was dumb).

So I shouted out to the teacher "hey miss what about shrek" she nodded and asked the class my crush and her friends went mad and happy and said yes the other people said yes but the roadmen where annoyed and started swearing.
Miss put on Shrek and we watched it then one of the roadmen looked at me with rage and said "hey m u look like Shrek cuz Ur fat" a couple people laughed my friend looked at me like she wanted to die. I personally found it fine he was putting me in comparison with the lord himself. A minute passed and the teacher just suddenly stood up.

This teacher was very mean and was kind of a bitch she had a bad reputation. As I said she stood up looked at the boy who told me that I looked like Shrek and screamed "what did u just say" he smirks and just dismisses it. She gets even more angry and goes on a rant saying "so he's Shrek cuz he is supposedly fat hmm well he isn't green or very tall ohh yeah and a ogre"(and more) the whole class goes silent and is looking at me and the roadman.
One of my friends is trying not to laugh while the other is having a panic attack (she is very dramatic) at this point I want to die I'm so embarrassed the teacher tells the boy to say sorry and shake my hand for some reason.

There is this certain tension in the air, the roadman acting cool says "miss wot u sayin yeah I int touching no gay like him" she looks at him with so much anger and he walks over all cool and says "yeah sorry fam was just joking in it" and shakes my hand.

After class my crush came up to me (cuz we are friends) and asks me if I'm okay I said it was fine and he was probably just angry cuz I suggested Shrek she smiled (I fucking love her smile I swear I'm so weird) and said "okay see u tomorrow" .


So I guess I got something good out of it

Tl:Dr tifu by asking to watch Shrek and humiliating myself and another class member


P.s sorry this is so long got carried away

Question regarding RPM hiccup So, I have a 2017 R and I've been riding mine enough to recently pass 40k mark.

I did just notice something just before taking my car in for the 40k service. At partial throttle in 5th and 6th, at 3k rpm, and then going to WOT, I notice the RPM rises and jumps back down before climbing again. Kinda like it races to like 3.8k and resets to 3.5 and keeps back on climbing. I can't tell if I feel a small loss in power or not.

This doesn't seem to happen in the lower gears at the same rpm and conditions.

Mine's all stock manual, clutch grips strong.

Anyone have any issues similar to this?
The dealer wrote in their diagnosis that it's doing what it is designed to do, but I don't think that's the case...

grillaz leaked transcript for the tv show

# Making guak with murdosc

(Last living souls instrumental plays in bg)

\*sound+video fade in\* Hello everybody this is making guack with yours truly Murdoc

Now the reason im making guack is because I found an easier solution to making the guak (which will get to in a bit)

Now the ingrediencies yull need are avocados, salt, pepper, and the most important!! 2d.

\*Cam zooms on 2d\*

2d: ello

Now what makes this special is that you wont need any tools ecstpt for a bowl if that’s even considered a tool

Ehemm ( puts hand on 2d’s head ) so first you get the avocado then you put it in 2d’s ear

2d: wait wot?!

Eh your such a faceache didn’t I stick an avocado up your ear before

Noodle: Murdoc I thought you were making regular guac

What did you expect. When im here nothing is regular.

Now contenuing

2d: ahhhhghhhhhh

\*nood drops cam and holds Murdoc back

Camera turns off

Weird vid of 2d with his head in the front of the camera and a avacdo being pushed in by mud going through his ear and coming out as guack in the other end (of his ear)

There's an angry wheezing duck under my hood. 2014 WRX Under heavy acceleration (Full throttle from 4K up) I'm noticing more intake noise and when I let my foot off the gas, there's a short loud wheezy duck blowoff sound that lasts about a second. It's only when the car is under heavy acceleration. Otherwise drives fine. No noticeable impact on acceleration.

This is the second time I've had this issue. The first time, the dealer found nothing wrong and it fixed itself. Since then, the engine has been rebuilt due to a rod bearing failure. My car is 100% stock. No idea how long it's been back. I generally don't drive my car hard. This one has me especially gunshy since the rod bearing failure. So it's not very often I'm north of 4K. Today I had to give her the beans to get ahead of some traffic for an exit ramp. First time I've gone WOT/high revs in a couple of months. Asthmatic blow-off duck leaves me feeling anxious and confused.

Orc suggestions "Orite bozz hummies, dis ere iz Laghed.  I az a few fingz me needz tu smash dum hummies betta."

\*Laghed stomps off and returns with a bloodied and beaten human and shoves a tattered scroll into his hand\*

"Dis wun ere iz gonna tellz u wot az Laghed az mur hummies tu smash."

\*Laghed whacks the broken human forward then jumps on his warg and rides off.  The human looks at the scroll and clears his throat\*

"The mighty and vicious Laghed has the following dema...suggestions for improving in life as an Orc."

\*mouths Help me\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Ability for members in the Orc guild to change their model to one of the Orc models on a one time only usage.  I believe the changes Gorgan made mean that anyone joining the Orc guild should gain the Orc trait and show as friendly to Orcs, it still requires GM intervention to change their model.  Having the above would remove reliance on the GM's.

2) This one is probably linked into notoriety changes, but any pets you have are hostile to Orcs.  I have to leave my warg pack outside and certainly can't dismount.  Would be good if your pets inherits your Orc trait.

3) Would be nice to have some form of teleporter between the main Orc Fort and the one in Vesper for a change of scenery.  Make the currency to pay for it severed heads or something.

4) There's a big hole at the right side of the fort by the mountain where the Orc vendors like to wander out of, could do with being blocked up.

5) Some form of feather supply would be nice for arrows, think the closest is in the Stable at Magincia, which is in a guardzone so not really tenable for a Red Orc.  Maybe a smattering of Harpies in the area?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*The human looks around, realises he's alone and makes a break for it.  An crudely put together arrow pierces his eyeball and he drops to the floor\*

1999 SV-650, more charging issues.. Had the R/R and battery replaced a little over 2 months ago when it wouldn’t crank and the battery was dead, I’m guessing OEM R/R, but I didn’t ask so it’s highly likely the stock unit

Anyway I was on the way home from work and I filled up with fuel, went to start it and it cranked once and the dash lights went out (exactly like you’d get with a dead battery), and I kept my finger on the starter and about a second later it fired up, weird.. didn’t think much of it and then later on I tried making two overtakes and it misfired under WOT, felt like it nearly threw me off the seat

Got the volt meter on the battery and it was reading 12.3v with everything off, then 12.8-13 idle, dropping to 12.6 with main beams on and 12.2 when revved to 5k. These readings are too low right? Is this likely the same problem or is another part of the charging system out of whack like the alternator? I’m not sure what the misfire could be. Plugs are 2 months old, could there be some crap in the drainage holes or rubbish in my gas tank?

I’ll be honest I don’t mess around with electrics because I hate it. Mechanical stuff no problem, so I wouldn’t know where to start diagnosing. Should I just take it to the shop and have them look at it?

Question about ltfts I just installed an Cobb sri and a high pressure fuel pump. All my numbers are looking perfect. I was going to install the downpipe and my intercooler today but I decided I would go on the interstate and take some logs before, just to make sure all my numbers still look good. Well my ltfts are at 11 at normal throttle, which I read could be a problem because it's not in a +/-8 range, also at a cold start it jumps to 11. At WOT it drops to 0, no matter the rpm, and at idle I hold a very steady 3. I just reflashed it with the cobb stage one plus tune and I saw some people you need to give your ecu some time to adjust, so should I just go drive around some more and see if my normal throttle numbers drop? Or are these numbers normal?

TLDR; My LTFTS are at 10 to 11 at normal throttle and on a cold start, and normal under idle and WOT. Is this normal?

I had a dream that Ballas' sword was released, and DE got a little crazy with it. I basically just woke up from this dream:

So I was at my foundry and I check the "in progress" tab and notice what I believe was called the "Abattacryst", Ballas' (unconfirmed) sword's name.

So I hover over it and it says something about weakening foes, corrupting and atrophying them, and it says in big bold letters at the bottom:

**(Corrupted bodies are replaced with Withered versions for now)**

Anyone play FFXV and use the Death Arcana on enemies? The one that drains them into really REALLY skinny versions of themselves? Exactly like that.

Anyway, I claim the sword and it says "How many would you like to claim?"

I was like "fuck man, I'll take like 80 or something I love this thing already". So I did. I took 81 of them.

So I go to the armory and equip one and it says "how many would you like to equip?"

wot?

"um, like.... 40? I guess?" and I confirm.

BAM, FUCKIN SWORDS EVERYWHERE, BABY.

I had swords on my lower arms, upper arms, I had sword wings, I had sword legs I had sword boots, sword armor, the mere act of bullet jumping eviscerated anything within range and it had some crazy fuckin' anime-ass stance.

^^^sword ^^^armor ^^^when?

I woke up and I was all "what the fucking shit?"

It was a neat dream and all, but man was it weird.

New decibel measuring devices. My truck vs a City bus. New decibel measuring devices that tell you how loud your vehicle is are out there. One is on 99th street north bound just south of whyte.

Was on the city bus yesterday and as we pulled away the monitor went off and said 90 db. I was worried because I thought my truck would be too loud.

I drove to work this am, and I have a modified exhaust on my truck. 4 inch turbo back no resonator and a very straight through muffler from flo-pro.

I decided to get on it to see how loud my truck was. I hit 72 decibels. (maximum allowed is 85 db) WOT getting up to 50. Just driving by normally I was around 58-60.

So everyone with a mildly modified exhaust should be fine. As for city busses I had no idea they were that loud.

Hypothetical: the zombie apocalypse arrives during the next semifinals of AGT. Which remaining acts/judges are goners? Mel would shout "WOT JUS HAPOOOOOOND!!!" and get swarmed by the hord of walkers. Heidi is stunned and doesn't think quick enough to leave, so she is also eaten. Simon abandons Heidi and  runs to hide behind Aaron Crow, who uses the sword to protect him. Howie hides under the table. Out of shape acts like Vicki, Noah and Christina make a run for the exit, but are too slow to evade the zombies. Shin Lim throws cards at the zombies skulls fast enough to kill them. Duo Transcend use their acrobatic skills to reach high ground, above the chaos. Zurcaroh works together to somersault and jump over the horde, escaping. Both choirs don't know what to do and all the members are bitten by zombies. Brian King Joseph uses his tattered violin bow as a sword, but it doesn't work very well and he also falls. One by one, the remaining acts are taken out. Fortunately, the Savitsky Cats and Mochi return at the last moment to save the day. The cats claw out the zombies brains, killing them dead, while Mochi uses his diabolo to crush their skulls.

Survivors: Aaron Crow, Simon, Howie, Shin Lim, Duo Transcend, Zurcaroh, Savitsky Cats, Mochi.

Anyone else feels pressured/guilt tripped by retail salesman to always buy something once you ask for their help? Went on a casual stroll through the city today and wanted to try on some new clothes  and see if there's anything good for me. So I started randomly looking through things with my mother. I stopped at the jeans section and tried to find my size. A lady came up to me with the usual "May I help you?". I said "Yes I'm looking for a jeans in this size and this colour". She went on found some actually nice looking jeans from Marco Polo, but with a price of 120$. I knew from the beginning that I'm not going to buy those jeans. She also gave me a shirt to try on and measured my waist, neck etc. The shirt looked nice aswell, but I wasn't going to buy it either. So anways I brought the clothes back to her. She asked "Okay which one is it going to be?". I replied "Yea...neither I have to think this through. Thank you very much for your help". She was like "...you're welcome...". I didn't turn around but I bet she was like "you fooking wot m8?!" hahha

I returned to my mother and she was like "Ohhh this poor  women, all those clothes she brought you, all the measurements, you could have atleast bought the shirt". "Mom you and dad are always easily guilt tripped into something you don't want really to do"

It's like doing the basics of your job is a such a big deal now. This is why I don't like asking for too much help. In some countries, like Turkey those salesmen get very agressive if you don't buy anything within a certain time and they are also very pushy.

Kinda like tipping the pizza guy, good job doing delivering a disgusting pizza, now you want a tip eh?

The 2018 Convention: CRINGE Well my convention was this past weekend and I managed to survive. Hopefully this one is my last since my plans to move out are still on track this year.


Anyways some things really stood out to me this year. Especially their emphasis on refraining from self reliance and pushing unquestioning obedience.  I'm just going to hit on what really stood out to me. I'm typing this from memory so bear with me.


First was the video about the young man in school was caught the interest of a girl. Watching this had me fuming with anger, because I remember being conflicted like that kid several times. But unlike the video, I didn't find myself happy and fulfilled after receiving loving counsel. Instead I was disappointed on passing up the opportunity, and still confused. Because aside from that stupid scripture about being "unevenly yoked" they really had no other basis to be against dating.


The talk on Saturday "Courageous but Not-Self Reliant" U Fukken wot m8? I was listening in and out on this one, but I already knew they were trying to discourage independent thinking. Aside from that, this was to keep the rank and file thinking that they can't do anything without the the org.


The video with the young girl standing up to the woman in the market was flat out UNREALISTIC. The daft bitch already knew where she was at, yet she still walked right on in and purchased something. Then when she was offered the LGBT bracelet she turned it down in a way that hinted at disgust. She literally made herself a target. Had they filmed the video with her smiling and tactfully saying "Thanks, but I'll pass." then nothing would've happened.


Actually all the videos were flat out corny, unrealistic, and overall cringe worthy. I noticed in a lot of these videos, the JW's are actually isolating and making targets of themselves, and that's exactly what the GB wants. There were better ways the situation could be handled, but of course they had to make it fit their narrative. This is going to feed the JW persecution complex a lot.


But the final video. Oh man, ya'll weren't lying about how ridiculous it was. Seriously. The music. The JW's hugging in the field. The stupid flash backs from previous  videos. The people surrounding them with guns (FEAR MONGERING). Then they actually show Jesus and his angels coming to save them. I mean they really got a guy dressed up with a bow and arrow. Sure enough people around me were in tears. I cringed so hard I had goosebumps. Then we had to sing the SAME damn song from the video....


Lastly what really made me sick was the first symposium on Sunday. This really made me see how delusional and cult like this religion is. One of the speakers joked about the military aiming their weapons at the sky and firing saying "I hope we're getting him!". The auditorium erupted in laughter. Every part of that symposium was completely insane, and by that I mean the way the speakers were convinced that this is all going to happen very soon.


Anyways, after attending this convention, any doubts I had about JW's being a cult are completely gone.


Thanks for reading.

1984 Mercruiser 350 Troubles Hello all, thought I’d make it through the whole season without any major issues. I was sadly wrong.

This past weekend I took went to start the boat and it wasn’t starting like it normally would, the starter sounds like it engages for about one second and then just spins. Ended up taking off the power steering belt and it fired up.

Then once I had idled out of the no wake zone and tried to bring it up on plane it bogs down and will stall out if I don’t back off the throttle. If I put it in neutral and throttle only it will go full rpm, but under load it will bog down and eventually stall.

It will then not start unless you allow it to sit for a little while. So I pulled it out of the water and checked the usual suspects.

I replaced the fuel filter, spark plugs (all of which on starboard side were badly fouled, port side looked clean), did an oil change, and checked the filter before the carb which was clean.

Now it starts up pretty easily ( I think the start may still be bad). But it still won’t go WoT. You can’t even slowly ease it up on plane.

I’m not sure what the next steps should be, it appears to have enough gas going into the carb, but possibly a bad fuel pump? Or maybe something with the distributor?

Hacks made their wait to PS4 I started running to Artorias, when I saw a message of some guy invading me.
“Nevermind, I’ll sprint all the way to the bossfog and not worry” I thought.
2 mins later, while sprinting, no invader in sight... suddenly, the red asshole teleported on me and backstabbed me without animation. He just appeared, *pop*, while I was sprinting, and stood there, chilling, while I was being backstabbed by air. Apparently the hardest boss in the game is air, now. Gravity is in the Vanilla version. The DLC boss is OP.

He was nowhere to be seen, I am damn sure, as I won’t stop turning my camera around my character while I sprint through an area, to keep track of my enemies and have nausea and vomit. He was nowhere to be seen, and BAM, “wot rings you got bithc?” on my back.

And I thought hacks were a PC exclusive  add-on provided my Micro$$oft...

confusing car problem TL;DR car lost torque and power in underground, car sounds like it has asthma sucking in lots of air. ignition cut under WOT.

EA113 TFSI VW engine (intake, ECU tune)

So this happened recently, car was running fine no problems.

recently when I've entered underground parking garages (in China where they are hot and the air is very dense) the car loses power at low RPM and the throttle lags. there is also a loud sound of air sucking from the intake and when this sucking sound is happening the car can barely move, after I blip the throttle there will be a lot of air released through the BOV and the car will return to ''normal'' after i would leave the underground parking the car would return to normal.

Now, I was stuck in an underground parking for around 20 minutes with the problem happening and getting worse. after i left the parking the problem stayed, now under WOT the car will cut ignition at high RPM. I've lost a noticeable amount of torque.

I've checked intake connections, I've check plugs and cylinder pressure, no engine light so I'm really confused!

Rough idle and loss of power (Fiesta ST) Hi guys

My car is having these problems:

- rough idle sometimes, mostly ok!
- loss of power after 3500/4000RPM, depends on temperature, 2/10 cases it will pull nice but not perfect
- problems holding revs (here a video https://youtu.be/cRth0VkhIUw)
- after WOT pull and letting go of the gas pedal completely car jerks a bit
- exhaust rattles horribly on takeoff when cold
- rattles bad when warm but less than when cold

Car is a 2015 Fiesta ST with ported Head, completely forged engine internals (pistons, rods, rod bearings, rod bolts, head gasket), GTX2867r turbo, performance headers/ex manifold, external recirculated wastegate, turbosmart bov, 200 cell sports cat, full exhaust, custom tune.

Already done:
- replaced fuel pump, didn‘t help
- checked and re-gapped spark plugs, didn‘t help
- checked all vacuum lines, everything ok

The car should make 320 WHP but it feels like 260-270 WHP. The base tune I had on the car (260WHP) felt just as fast if not faster than what the car is running now.

Would I be somewhat safe to assume the sports cat failed and clogged/melted creating a blockage in the downpipe? I think the rattle is coming from the cat area..

Background: I had a vacuum line which wasn‘t fastened good enough fall off twice from the car, causing it to overboost and misfire bad (invisible rev wall with several misfires stinking like hell and extremely loud), right after the second time the vacuum line fell (fixed now) and the misfires happened, the car seemed to run worse and the exhaust rattle has become worse too..

If it‘s the cat, is there any DIY tips to remove it? Please no legal/illegal discussion, I would just like to knock it off. Do I just take the DP off and start hammering into the cat material until everything falls off? I don‘t want to cut it open and weld it together again.

Am I ruining my car by taking it to the track? Let’s say you have someone who never exceeds 3k rpm driving around and slowly accelerating.

I do that usually, but lately ever since I have gotten a new 2017 Avalon touring I have put 30k miles with plenty of hard downshifts that hit 5.5k-6k and flooding it and then up shifting at the track. I’ve been going about 3 times a week after the gym and running the car to its limit for an 30 minutes to an hour with at least 20mph rolls to 80mph accelerating at WOT 4 times each day.


I plan to own this Avalon, should I enjoy spirit driving are there limits? Or should I immediatly stop because I honestly want this to reach 150k before I plan to replace her.

What might be the benefits/losses from unplugging the intake silencer/''cold air intake''? On most cars if not every, there's a tube that goes from the air box to a spot in the engine bay where there is a cold air flow. For example, I had a manual 2001 Grand Vitara who had a small S tube who brought air directly from inside the passenger fender. I drive an automatic 2015 Yaris daily as a delivery car, which has a short tube that goes right over the radiators further in the bumper. My actual personal car is a manual 2012 Civic and it has much longer tube who seems to go into the driver fender.

&amp;#x200B;

From my experience, it's mostly only benefits. The throttle response gets incredibly better, there's a lot more ''immediate'' power delivery. It makes the intake noise quite a lot louder and with variable timing engines it makes the engine scream even more at high RPM. The only disadvantage I might notice is that ''maybe'' it worsens the fuel consumption and ''maybe'' it makes WOT accelerations slower. I've unplugged it on my delivery Yaris a while ago and there's not one day where I regretted it. On my Honda though, the air box is very close to the firewall, which places it where there is a lot of heat from the engine already, especially on hotter days where even with some good air flow where it might not be enough to dissipate all the ambiant heat.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts about this? Any personal experiences or inputs?

Does unplugging the intake silencer/''Cold air intake'' has any negative effects? Hello! I have a 2012 Civic DX with a manual transmission, I have found that when I unplug the big tube underneath the air box, I get a crazy better throttle response, nearly as if my throttle was by a cable! Also it makes the intake hella louder. From this point, I think I might permanently leave it disconnected but I am unsure if it has any negative effects, for example maybe some slower WOT(Wide Open Throttle) acceleration and an increased fuel consumption and mainly sucking a lot of hot air from the engine bay on hotter days. I recently installed a K&amp;N air filter and it has made the driving experience better overhaul, but never as good as when I unplug that darn tube on the air box.

XR650L running rough. Sputtering and bogging. Help
Purchased a 2002 XR650L yesterday. One owner, 6200 Miles, good shape﻿﻿﻿﻿ (for $2000). The owner told me it has a slight hesitation, but I figured I can work on it myself.

Bike was from Cali originally but has been in NC for 10 years at 500ft elevation where I live, and has been modded slightly. From what I can﻿ tell, it’s b﻿﻿﻿een de-smogged and has a DJ jet kit insta﻿lled, along with a K&amp;N filter and snorkel removed, ﻿IMS tank, and 15t front sproket (I’m pretty sure). He took out the spark arrestor at some point in time, but it’s back in now

﻿ Took it for a 20 mile ride just now and it﻿ really runs poorly. Takes a while to warm up, but seems to rev just fine at idle. On the road unless I’m near WOT in 1-3 gears it stumbles and lugs. Gears 4-5 it’s very poor and does all kinds of stumbling and sputtering, unless I’m at 1/4 throttle or less. 5th gear is alm﻿o﻿﻿s﻿t unusable due to lack of power. No backfiring and the bike does not really smell rich, but it does run badly. Also seems to vibrate more than I’m used to, although it’s my first 650 so it could be normal.

Im mechanically inclined, but carb work makes me nervous. Where do I start with this issue? Install stock jets back, check plug or valves, just do a new kit or Dave’s mods?

Need 2 change skools? Ok so ive got fife hundred howers on fsx and i had my first fying leson 2day. It was in a cezzna 1052 which i kno lots about. Im better at the a380 and 747 (could get tipe rating eazy) but i kno about the cezznas too.
So it was the furst lessen and the plane teacher didnt even let me start the playne. I told him that i knew wot i was doing so he let me do sum taxiing. I was turning the yoke but the playne wasnt turning. So the playne was broken cos in fsx the playne turns wen u do that om taxi. The teacher doesnt let me do the atcing. Like, i didnt get tree hundred hours on vatsim 4 nothing. I think that he reelized i was good and could probably do his job so he let me do the appproch. I was flying fine at 50 nots but then he said to pitch down to get speed. Wat, i was scared cos i know that you add power for airspeed. I wos looking for the papi lites but therre were  none. Isnt that illeegal? Surely a pylote needs to have pappi lites. I wos flying a perfect final but then tge teecher took over for the landing. Wtf i kno what im doing come on i probqbly kno more than u. When wee got back, there wasnt even a marshallller we just parked on the grass. Oh and he didnt even have an efiis he was just uesing a map with lodes of lines on it. I was hopeing i would do an ils appproch (ive done tgem before) but he sed no. I definately need a new flite school and need to train at a proper airport . How do i reprot thr teecher to the playne police?

New labs, advice needed. Hey folks! I need to pick your brains. Long text to come, the short is:

Low conversion rate, suppressed TSH, what tests could I get done to address potential causes (deficiencies, inflammation)? Looking for proper sources that show an influence of conversion or TSH. In Germany, test should preferrably go through my GP (or potentially a new specialist), as I can't afford it otherwise.

\-

I just had my second appointment with an endocrinologist.

Short backstory: diagnosed a decade ago by a radiologist; labs within range (TSH 3.8 at its highest, before therapy fT4 at 20%, fT3 at 67%), ultrasound looking fine - but the szintigram showed my thyroid thinks working is *for losers*. Thyroid volume 9,7ml

I fared okay with 100mcg for several years (at \~62kg), with things slowly deteriorating starting three years ago. The only labs done at that time were TSH (1.15 to 0.54), until I saw last November's result (3.63) in March and upped my LT to 150 mcg, while waiting for an endocrinologist appointment three months laters.

Felt significantly better.

The labs three months ago: TSH suppressed (0.07), fT4 at 60%, fT3 at 50%. Vitamin D at 29.7 ng/ml (30-100), thyroid volume 5ml. Put on 125mcg LT.

Felt quite crappy again.

The labs now: TSH suppressed (0.03), fT4 at 49%, fT3 at 22%, Vitamin D at 30.1 ng/ml.

Doctor decided to change my prescription to LT 100mcg, because she wants to bring the TSH into range.

Antibodies have almost always been below range when tested, with a miniscule elevation of Anti-TPO seven years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that she has the labs of my first diagnosis, and it objectively shows that before therapy, my TSH was 'within range' but my thyroid didn't work properly, so that it was unlikely that the range which had *already not been applicable before was suddenly applicable now*. She just repeated that I was mildly hyperthyroid and that we had to bring the TSH into range, and that there are feedback loops - ignoring the part where the TSH didn't actually budge within the last three months. She also said that my vitamin D was normal now. (Seriously. *Seriously*. I can barely contain my desire to rant.) She also ignored it when I said I weigh 20kg more now, almost a third more than my initial (normal) weight. (Started gaining five years ago.) And, of course, she ignored it when I said I feel crappy (brain fog, no motivation, need to sleep loads, don't manage to study or focus on work, yay.)

There was no rT3 done at any point in time as here it's only done for severly ill hospitalized patients. I've had borderline low iron before. I may or may not have low selenium, though I didn't notice any improvement with LT100 + selenium last year. The thing is, my diet isn't a typical junkfood diet, but there are many foods I can't eat due to allergies. And, the worse brain fog I have the harder it is to plan out good meals, plus I have semi-frequent gastric distress which may have a negative impact on absorption.  Also, anything more than moderate exercise means I'll crash for the day and for the next one too for good measure. So I walk. My goal's been to walk at least 7km per day - yesterday I had a look at my step counter history and figured that before I upped to 150mcg, I averaged around 5km per day; about a month after upping I averaged 8km, a month after reducing dosage I went back to 5km per day; all with the same goal set (12k steps) and no other obvious factors that could've cause this. (My hunch for the crashing is a DIO2 polymorphism, but that's speculation.)

I've been taking Vitamin D3 supplements + getting sun exposure without sunscreen, but alas, it wasn't enough. (I have, however, freckes and a nice lightly darker hue of pink to show for it.)

As for deficiencies, my GP will likely agree to doing iron labs. I'm unsure about magnesium, because I've come across a couple of papers that said that in patients with thyroid illness, the relation between serum magnesium and magnesium at the tissue level is distorted. Also unsure about potassium and sodium. Calcium's been in range. Selenium should be tested I guess. Don't know about vitamins.

Cortisol: I would probably have to pay this out of pocket, and other than a few hints on blogs rather than in papers, I haven't seen anything about what use it would have. Had three short-term courses of prednisone, an oral glucocorticoid over the last three years to deal with bouts of persistent bronchitis. Other than the infection being better (twice in combination with an antibiotic, once without), there was no difference in systemic symtoms before and after, and I don't have any typical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency like very low blood pressure. Also, the way to go here seems to be an ACTH stimulation test, not a saliva or blood test.

Sex hormones: I've also not seen anything solid on these. I've never been on hormonal contraceptives. Had serious PMS until I first got Levothyroxin, these reappeared with my other symptoms over the last 3-5 years. (Boobs hurt. )= )

Inflammation: High [Interleukin 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997209000172) might lower TSH secretion. I have allergic asthma. While the inflammation in my lungs is down (not completely, but lung function's close to normal without corticosteroids for the time being), I still have swelling in my sinuses and in addition to that stomach discomfort plus recurrent moderate gastric distress. It's never been so painful that I thought I needed to see the doctor for it - but then, I sat through my wisdom teeth removal (including one that hadn't emerged) with the anaesthetic not at all working. (Yay for being a secret ginger.) I will address these issues with my GP and hope he takes them seriously. If you have anything else to go by or about tests, I'd love links.

Wow, what a WoT. Sorry. I'm pretty dejected as I'd hoped this endo would actually take the things I say seriously.

Hatewatch with me. Episode 6 Hi, everyone~

I'm Dr. Pete Stinkfinger. I have come to hate pretty much everyone on this show, yet I am compelled to watch it. I have no choice.
I am drawn to it, unable to avoid it.
Like a canker sore, I am forced to confront it over and over, reveling in the fresh hell it brings every week.

Please allow me to share my tortured thoughts with you~~

Hazel makes me sad:
https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/991npk/hazel_just_makes_me_depressed/


and awaaayyyy we go:

** Scenes from last week:
* Man oh man, I am trembling with anticipation about what kind of tank top tarik will sport this week
* For real, who is ximena running from? is this some FARC thing?

** The yin and yang of narcisstic insanity
* for real, I can see how hangry he was, I mean the grocery store was like a 3 hour trip, and it must have taken like an hour to cook that one giant steak in that tiny frying pan
* that's a pretty angry reaction to gravy, I mean, I love gravy, maybe you should try some, it's great, even on that rice which also pissed you off for some reason
* "Why aren't you eating?" "I don't want to get a tummyache from exertion when I murder you all in your sleep tonight. Haha. Ha."
* I play a game where I take a shot every time jesse blinks. Still haven't opened the bottle all season.
* holy smokes with the bat'leth eyebrows darcey, damn
* she's driving them back because they have school in the morning? isn't it like 3 am by now?
* I 100% guarantee jesse angry masturbated with a fistful of that steak as soon as they turned the corner. Like jerking off in front of the mirror while kissing himself and tearfully punching the wall. TELL ME I'M WRONG.
* ~~part two~~
* she was stepping on my shoe. now it needs to go in the black "stepped on" bag until I can sterilize it.
* first I have to think of angela's shitty giant ass and now darcey's gross harpey feet. they probably have a thicker rind than a wheel of parmesan.
* squeezed and pulled and hurt my neck
* "you want me to put on the white sneakers? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? THE WHITE SNEAKERS? THAT YOU STEPPED ON? Madness!"
* If I hadn't dodged it, that Louboutins would have been in my eye. Fortunately, I have seen the matrix a number of times....
* Ok, bear with me. compare this: https://imgur.com/a/qtjnZHu  with this : https://youtu.be/odWsjm4RJ88?t=67
* ~~part three~~
* can't let the fish slip the hook, gotta jiggle the bait every once in a while
* unpacks his suitcase, sees the black bag containing the still-soiled, formerly pristine white sneakers, flies into another rage
* "then break up with me. buy the illusion that you have the power. I am a loving man, but you won't let me love, darcey, and that's a shame that you treat me like this..sniff... and now you ruined the moment, you horrid woman, keep drinking. you want me to leave? I'm leaving. you want me to leave? I'm leaving. you want..."





** Smokey and the bandit
* "All of our fights so far seem to come from miscommunication" - honestly, it seems to me like you are communicating perfectly, you're just not liking what you're hearing.
* cow leg? that's so gross! can't I get a hamburger or steak or something?
* she's kinda got a dusty rhodes thing going on https://imgur.com/a/Ta6OhAP
* "20-25 years left with you" fucking jesus I hope not. I'm going to have to convince you to switch to filterless or take up alligator rasslin
* I feel like my brain was raped for being forced to think about micheal wiping her ass. I will never be able to eat  this again: https://imgur.com/a/05grywc
* "the age difference bothers me a lot, but, you know, not as much as dying poor in africa, soooo...."
* ~~part two~~
* "so this is a village" "yes" "it's peaceful" "yes, very peaceful" "what do people do all day?" "use the internet to try to meet fat white womeeennny things. many things....."
* ok, she needs to let this insecurity thing go. she's not even like "maybe he's trying to scam me for my money", she's like "I am old so maybe he's using the internets to masturbate to girl instragrammers and their poses." like, for real, let him mix some sugar to help him with that bitter dusty medicine
* ~~part three~~
* "he might be scamming these other women too!" "no, they're hot"
* "you need to figure it out before he gets over here, I mean, nigeria's a different state almost"



** Thirst needs no sleeves
* *completely silent, dodging his touch* "well I can tell you don't want to talk..."

* "he still owes me 4000 pesos" "holy shit, that sounds like a lot!" *looks up that it's ~$75* "god it's so hot that you think that's a lot of money. I tell you what, Imma buy you a new bed, but we gotta take the barrier off this one first, awww yeaaahhh"

* the brother is moving around so much I can't tell if he has cerebal palsy or he's on meth. he speaks the true true, tho



** Stropfordmumshirehampton's champion defender of women's honor
* "is this real?" "it is real. it's surreal!" *doofy smile*
* looking at the two of them facing each other, looking into each others' eyes, with such love, such tenderness, it's pretty clear that baby is going to have a giant giant fucking head. like legoman proportions. once she hits puberty she's going to look like either one of those giant suckers at the county fair or a snowman
* "This isn't fair, I can't just move on" like I did with the other two relationships/sperm doners
* ~~part two~~
* "did he ask you about my fights?" "yeah" "did you tell him I was defending women's honor, and I took down fiddy men? and then the goddam tojos took my shins!"
* where the hell is her father talking on the phone? a dentist's chair? a tanning bed? the passenger seat of a mini van? is he phase shifting?
* "Fighting's not good. period." "u wot m8? bet I could take you, you bloody wanker! why don't you climb out of that xerox machine and we'll see!"
* ~~part three~~
* I play a game where I take a shot every time jon closes his mouth completely. Still haven't opened the bottle all season.
* "I'll never lie to you, and I'll always work for you, as long as that work involves sorting recyclables or defending the honor of women"
* "it feels amazing to be engaged...again...again.."





** An ohio husky in colombia

* He's telling us the story of why he contacted ximena like we weren't all enjoying watching his dumb thirsty ass pine over plastic titties for the past 5 weeks
* two failed marriages say what? and how many creepy stalkings? in how many countries? I think he might be in colombia just because he's worked his way down to the "Cs"
* the prom picture of that guy at the gas station that you always call "tony" but you're pretty sure that's not his name even tho he never corrects you: https://imgur.com/a/lv01sfd
* holy shit the advertising for colombian cupid. I mean, if it can get this sweaty piece of walking human shame laid...
* en el cielo  = in heaven. even firestarter invested in google translate, c'mon guy.
* "no te preocupes porque me encantan los ninos y amber puede..." "Yes, el cafe is very hot, you know, hot? El hot-o? Owie burn burn?"
* I dunno tho, if a woman holds your hand while you're sporting the largest fanny pack known to man, maybe it really is love
* ~~part two~~
* fanny pack and camo cargo pants? I think I understand the online  dating thing a little better...
* "she never *directly* asked me for money..." ok, here we go, it was either this, a green card, a kidney, or establishing a FARC sleeper cell in fucking ohio

* at the rental place: "Give me the shiny-est, most ill-fitting suit you have, I'm getting married today!" (pushes "TRANSLATE" button)
* when you set the character creation template to "douche" : https://imgur.com/a/ua8njXh
* fucking hell, am I out of the loop? wtf is it with the eyebrows on this show? it's like they're all trying to poison snow white
* someday I hope my own wedding will be so beautiful and have so many flawlessly white plastic lawnchairs
* I wonder if she's crying because she saw his tie, because, damn
* I am really sure her makeup is inspired by chantal, like it's uncanny
* and a THIRD translator, jesus, no one wants to see him twice if they speak english
* the father's accent in portuguese is like almost comical, like the portuguese version of cleetus on the simpsons. I'm not trying to shit on her dad, I'm just mentioning it because it's kinda funny if you understand him, especially when he was all lit at the wedding reception


That's it for this week, I hope you enjoyed sharing my pain with me.

see you next week~~~

First WC - wot I learned R5 : I'm pleasantly surprised to have completed my first WC (1.25) after 616 hours (over a few years), and probably a fair chunk on EU3 as well. What started as a first time run as Austria "to see what this PU lark is all about" snowballed a bit after I felt I'd got really lucky with what came my way :

Standard PU's over Bohemia and Hungary, allied Spain

Picked up the Burgundian Inheritence

France's king (my rival) dies without an heir, so even though I've no marriage, I get invited to contest against Savoy &amp; France. Everything's coming up Millhaus right now.

I welcome France into my enlightened circle of member states ; it's what they deserve after intervening in what was otherwise looking like an early successful war against the Ottomans.

In the space of about fifty I years I proceed to successfully prosecute Enforce Union wars against Spain and Portugal, and then the cherry on the top, I get invited to fight for the throne of Russia, just in time for Absolutism.

(could possibly have grabbed AI Scandinavia as well but decided not to because I wanted to make my life difficult)

At this point I felt I probably wasn't going to get a better shot at a WC run and decided to step off into unknown territory, culminating in running the British swine down in their last redoubt in Thailand in 1817.

**What I could have done better :**

**Reformation** : haven't played in Europe for a long time so I wasted a lot of time and effort not understanding how to deal with Centres of Reformation. Force converting the HRE members and then having them convert back is very annoying and costs you relation every time. I was still converting well into the 1650s, although I did benefit from the Papal Influence it delayed my revoke until around the 1630s.

**Court and Country :** I only got this to fire at the end of the 1600s and didn't realise that it was going to cost me 20 absolutism for 10 years whilst it was running. This slowed down my expansion during a key when I was trying to overpower the Ottomans, an incredibly resilient Timurids, and move into India. Get it as soon as you can - I saw a tip on here that suggested you raise autonomy in the 1580's to be able to lower again come 1600. Excellent advice that I wish I'd read three weeks ago.

**Great Britain :** I left them in glorious isolation so that by the time I came to fight them, the wooden wall had been upgraded to steel. In the early wars they were running a fleet of 200 heavies which just swatted aside anything that went near them. For the first few wars I contented myself with whittling away at their colonies for mid war score victories, until I got lucky enough in the 1780s to be able to dump enough soldiers to take London, whilst their 500k mercenaries ran around the British Isles. Their fleet was unbeatable, and remained so until I took their final lands. Not sure how they were paying for it, but they were. Learning point - take them apart, take a foothold in the Scottish islands, don't let them build up their navy, don't let them establish their trading companies. You'll regret it. Wound up wasting an idea slot on naval (I know) rather than innovative just to try and manage to win a naval battle. Up until I grabbed London and immediately peaced out I didn't think I'd be able to make a dent in them and that war really was my last shot - my last three wars were all truce breaks, which meant the last six years was set against the backdrop of the Agitation for Liberty disaster, stuck on -3 stability because I couldn't spare the admin to get back to +3 and do the coring I needed to achieve the WC. I wound up revoking simply to get the soldiers needed to fight off the revolts. A lot rebel scum learnt what it is to be truly free.
**Overextension** : Aggressive Expansion is, after a certain point, just a number. Overextension is a nightmare throughout your entire run. A few times I casually decided to run up to 180%, sometimes through idiocy sometimes through bad math, sometimes through incorporating France when they're in the midst of eating 80% overextension you dumped on them. Dealing with the consequence of overextension killed my manpower a few times and probably cost me around a decade of expansion, even with the unrest reduction advisor. Client states help - a ugly multi tag world conquest is still a world conquest. Spread the burden around - I didn't vassal feed within the HRE which would have made things a lot lot lot easier.

**Hanging in there :** From when I really got going in the mid 1660's until my last war, I wasn't really sure it was doable - I needed to eat 3k dev in the last 20 years, hence the truce breaking.. It will take two years to eat your 100% OE, so you want to be starting a war so that when you're ready to peace out your coring is just finishing. If you've got smaller countries to gobble up try and balance them so you're staying around 100% OE. You should be able to consume about 400 dev per two round by the time you get full absolutism. Just keep eating and see where you are come the start of the 19th century.

Boosted Mustang Trouble Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this question is too technical for this sub, or if I just won't be able to give enough information for the problem to be diagnosed, but I'd like to give it a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

I have a 2007 Mustang GT with a 4.6L V8. I installed a vortech supercharger with an air to air intercooler a couple months ago. I also installed the nessesary supporting mods like the fuel injectors, new plugs, coils, and a Kennbell boost a pump on the stock pump. I've also got 3 guages for monitoring which include a Wideband A/F, Fuel pressure, and boost.

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem:**

I recently got back from a 1000 mile trip, and on the way back, I noticed the engine would cut off (like it would if traction control were to engage) when I would try to rev it, or accelerate hard. It seems to cut off at around the 3K rpm mark when the engine starts making boost. A/F drops to around 12 while fuel pressure spikes up to 60 and drops back to 25 when the engine cuts off. I have a feeling the engine is not getting enough air for some reason, but I went to check through all of the fittings for the tubing and everything was snugged up tight and the throttle body fully opens at WOT.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to avoid having to go to my tuner if I can help it since he is pretty far away from me and will probably charge me the dyno minimum to get my car up on the dyno if he needs to. I am hoping this is something stupid like the MAF sensor or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

1972 sportster xlch sputters at speed. ok so mostly this bike is just a fun little project that gets out for the occasional Sunday ride. always something needing to be done on it. well last weekend it was getting late and we decided to take the highway back. this didn't go well.

i had to keep it at WOT to go 65 and it went no faster. whats more it seems like more air came out the intake at my leg than through the exhaust. testing it the problem only occurs higher than 3500rpm and gets worse the more throttle is opened.

i have already checked the pushrods, and the points are gaped right. my next thought could be either the timing or the condenser. i dont have a timing light on me so that was just set back to where i could start the bike and then given a little bit of advance (so possibly still a little retarded). the condenser could be bad but i have no idea how to tell other than pitting points or no spark.

what do you all think and could anyone tell me the specs of the condenser to i might find a capacitor to fit.

This makes no cents Do I love coins? Do I hate them? A shiny dollar is delightful, but a roll is a nuisance.

&amp;nbsp;

I live in a cash-reliant society, where coins range from 10¢ to $10. Psychological prices are everyone's bane, because they curse consumers with 10¢ and 20¢ pieces - bagatelles fit for public transport, chain stores, catapulting and no more. Not even the bakery or greasy spoon would take them. It took me marathons of bus rides to be free of their spell.

&amp;nbsp;

Even worse, there's a law against paying over two dollars in cents (taste the bus driver's wrath should you rain down fractions), and the government's coin-recycling bus rarely makes rounds.

&amp;nbsp;

That's why if coins could be spent, or exchanged for fifties to be stored in an electronic tap-card (let's call this wonderful thing "the Tapper"), so they'd go. Having purged the catapult ammo and most of the half-dollars, now I arm myself lightly before leaving home to phase out the rest.

&amp;nbsp;

On most days the only chance is lunchtime, but prices almost always end on the dollar. The latest 50¢ had been piggybacking for a week - seven days too long.

&amp;nbsp;

Yet today luck dropped by.
    "Student special, any 2 choices - $29.5."

&amp;nbsp;

Nine-and-a-half! That's four birds with one stone! And just in time before the good choices were sold out. Coins in one hand and wallet in the other, I joined the queue and began to cou-

&amp;nbsp;

"What'ya like, me lad?" *wot? crap here's a two...*
"Eh... student special, choices A and C?" *...three... wait, four...*
"T' drink?" *four plus five...nine?...*
"Ah... soup of the day." *...shitwheresthe... 9.50 ...*
"Here or t' go?" *... wot... nononoNO...no twenty!?*
"Here." *... walletwalletgimmeahundred...*
"Twenty-nine fiddy." *... fucknonotthetenner! ... the red one... red *
"Here you go, mada-"

&amp;nbsp;

***BEEP!***

&amp;nbsp;

"Ah well. You've dunnit."
"... what?"

&amp;nbsp;

    Tapper transaction approved. Paid 29.5. Remaining 10.0.

&amp;nbsp;

I looked down. Opened wallet in my right hand, dangling an inch above the sensor. $109.5 in my left hand.
A printer spat out the order, which the cashier swiftly gave me.

&amp;nbsp;

...

&amp;nbsp;

"Say, you're running low on your card. Can top it up wi' that red snapper, no?"
"Oh. Okay."

&amp;nbsp;

    Amount remaining 110.0.

&amp;nbsp;

At least one thing went centless today.

Loss of power/almost no acceleration I known there are a bunch of threads like this, and I've read them all, but still can't find the answer. This is a 2005 Rebel with 4800 miles on it. My symptoms:

 * Bike was running like a top all summer long
 * Bike sat for a week or so
 * Went to start it, it had a really rough time starting or holding an idle
 * When starting from a stop, as I slowly let out the clutch, holding throttle quarter open, it stalls. If I do this VEEEERRRY slowly and it gets rolling, it doesn't stall out, but the RPMs drop noticeably, to the point where it almost stalls and there is almost no acceleration. Then it catches.
 * Bike won't start with the choke, only without it. I can barely manage to get it started with the choke if I WOT it and press the starter, but then lowering the choke and especially turning it off kills the engine immediately and every time, hot or cold.

What I did:

 * Changed the oil. I noticed it was a tad low, so I changed it from conventional oil that was a few months old to Mobil 4T racing 10W40 synthetic.
 * Disassembled the carb and cleaned it. I didn't see anything particularly clogged in there, but I ran through it all with the can of cleaner and a wire.
 * Checked inline fuel filter. It's flowing great.
 * Adjusted idle to be 1450 RPM using a digital tach
 * Adjusted idle screw so it's all the way in (which increased RPM from 1400 to 1500). Then set idle to about 1450. It has the limiter cap on it, which I didn't take off, so it was only about 3/4 of a turn.
 * Checked slack in throttle cables, and it was minimal.
 * I put in new plugs about a month ago.

None of that made a difference. The bike acts the same when cold or warm. Where I am the weather is a balmy 70-80 degrees.

I do hear some kind of noise that might be valve slapping, but I don't fully know what that sounds like. I don't think this bike ever had valves adjusted.

Question Misfires Hey all so I recently went stage 1 with **MHD** on my 2009 335i after feeling like the car was up to it. about a week later the car developed a misfire in cylinders 2 and 6 under wot and at around 5K, car sputters then will throw a code and SES light. The spark plugs were recently replaced by the dealer so my next guess is the ignition coils which to my knowledge have yet to be replaced. I wanted another opinion on what could be the culprit, thanks

Need Help With 1989 F-150 Diagnosis Hey guys,

I have a 1989 F150 xlt Lariat with the 5.0l, that I've owned for 4 years and have put quite a few miles on and a lot of love into.  It needs to go through DEQ, which I attempted a couple of days ago and failed miserably due to high Carbon Monoxide.  I wasn't too surprised because it has been smelling rich when it idles.

I took it home and pulled the codes and I have code 23 for key on, engine off (tps), and code 33 for both continuous and engine on (egr).

I had recently replaced the tps due to age, but I went ahead and tested it - 5v for the reference wire but only .65v when closed and gets up to 4.50v at wot. It seems like .65v is too low for a closed reading but the tps is non adjustable.  The truck runs great with no issues, other than smelling rich through the exhaust.

The EGR valve and tube I replaced a couple of years ago when I had the intake manifold off to replace the passenger side valve cover gasket.  The stock exhaust tube was cracked so I went ahead and replaced everything.  I gave it a quick test yesterday by sucking on the vacuum line and it makes the engine stumble, so I think the valve is ok.  I haven't checked the plunger yet.  Again, no driveability issues, the truck runs great.

Before I dive too far into this, I know there are people who have been around the block a few more times than I have and thought I'd reach out for any pointers.  Thank you in advance for any help.

Clutch slipping at 8,700 miles. I just went to merge onto the highway, 5th gear at ~60 MPH went WOT and my clutch slipped about 500 RPM. If I get on the gas hard in fifth or sixth at highway speeds it is slipping consistently. I don't have any bad habits (riding the clutch, using it to hold the car on hills, not rev matching, brake boosting etc). Has anyone else had problems with this few miles? The car is completely stock. Is VW going to tell me to kick sand because it is a wear part?

Jane the Ripper and why I left (part 1) I don’t often post stories of my justNOmom on this sub, as my JNmom isn’t really heinous enough on a regular basis to warrant that (my boyfriend fundamentally disagrees with this and thinks I should post more often, as he’s read every post and the comments and thinks it's healthy to post here and get support). This subs support has been absolutely fantastic.


 It has been really good to look back at things I’ve written when I get to thinking “It wasn't that bad” “Maybe she’ll change” “Maybe I deserved it?” “I’m so whiney and dramatic” For a quick tldr on my previous posts: She’s been both physically and emotionally abusive to me throughout my life. This is the story of why I eventually moved out of Jane the Rippers house.


So (bare with me the timeline here is estimated) in 2016 I had finally gotten my first job, graduated highschool and eagerly awaited my first semester at University. Around this time, Jane the Ripper decided that now was the perfect time to mention “Oh hey by the way your biological dad is out of prison and were going on a date. He wants to meet you!”


For quick context: I was raised by stepdad, he never legally adopted me but treated me as though I were his since the day I was born. To me stepdad WAS dad, and it didn't really matter who biodad was and honestly my mom didn’t even know who my biodad was as there were…. quite a few men who could have been the biodad. So to have her come up to me, without even a DNA test and declare that this man WAS my father 100% was a bit of a surprise. Turns out he had been in prison for xx years for some serious drug dealing charges (he tried selling hard stuff to an undercover cop).


So she has a few dates with him, drags me to meet him and at the time I think “Ok he doesnt suck, not the best of her boyfriends so far but how bad could this get?” Oh how I was such a sweet summer child.
Jane the Ripper goes on to gush about how wonderful this all is, how she's happy to have a full family finally and that she's glad that we get along.


About a week after I meet him, she bursts into my room one afternoon and mentions “Oh yeah by the way he’s moving in with us for a few weeks be nice to him byeeeee!”


*Wot.*


*Tinyflame.exe has stopped working.*


What makes this even more special is that after stepdad died when I was young, she constantly repeated how she’d never even let another man stay the night much less move in as men are just horrible beings and honestly why don’t we just get rid of them (her words not mine).


So he moves in, for the first three months (yes months. I was told it would be 3-4 weeks at most just until he got onto his feet) things were decent, he cleaned up after himself and even cooked for himself. Then he got comfortable. Cue leaving dirty dishes everywhere to grow mold, spilling entire glasses of bright red kool aid on the cream carpet and just leaving it to stain and so on. His worst transgression was leaving wet towels on the floor after his x3 showers a day to grow mildew, and grow mildew they did (all over the goddamn house, it took weeks to go away). We also got roaches at the time from the buffet of food left on the floor.


So Jane the Ripper, being a bit of a neat freak but complaining if she had to clean anything that wasn't her own quickly went from loving girlfriend to screaming harpy in the matter of minutes. The house was then filled with constant yelling, hitting (from her, mostly), and throwing whatever was near.


I remember speaking with Jane the Ripper and asking her to finally kick him out, it’s been long enough and at this point we’re far beyond 3-4 weeks of him staying here. He hasn't even gotten a job to contribute to the expenses, and Im expected to pay for him to live here even though he’s in his 40’s?! She told me she’d get to it and to have patience, she promises to tell him tomorrow. He has until xx day to leave, then it’ll be back to normal. Except she never actually followed through, she’d make threats to him but he never actually left.


At one point she screamed at him to leave, but as he refused to get off the sofa she went to go call the police to get them to force him to leave. He yelled back that he’d love to see her try, as he’d hid a bunch of “crystal” around the house and if the police came he’s taking us down with him. This became a habit of Jane The Ripper, one day she'd give him a date to be out of the house or just try to kick him out with no notice, and the next she'd be back to being a teenage girl in love with the bestest boyfriend ever.


Multiple times, regardless if Jane the Ripper was there or not, He’d scream at me for being a sneaky bitch that wasn't no blood of his (I hope I’m not actually related to you), ungrateful for everything he did (what exactly do you even do again besides watch TV?) and that he "wasn't 'fuckin goin anywhere”. It got to the point where if I tried speaking to Jan the Ripper about anything, even “has the dog been walked yet?” he would go off and scream because I was trying to go behind his back and betray him. When she was there, she'd sit and listen to him scream and really do nothing about it, or she'd join him occasionally and yell about how I was jealous of their amazing relationship and just wanted to ruin their lives.


At this point I had begun University, and  surprise surprise, constant screaming and the lack of a peaceful home life doesn’t contribute well to good grades. Along with my grades, my emotional stability started to fail. I started having more regular suicidal thoughts, and got into a very dark place at the time. Jane the Ripper either didn't notice or didn't care, though both are good possibilities.


For now, this has gotten to long and I'll post in another day or so, in accordance with the once a day rule. Have a good day everyone.

It won't end well for whites in america in the next 80 years if they don't reform their whiteness paradigm , contradictions and hypocrisies This is again in regards to white people's  white paradigm and culture  surrounding race , which is one of denial , indifference and hypocrisy. If you think race relations based on white peoples denial of white racism is bad currently, ypu haven't seen anything yet. People of color will be the majority in The decades to Come. Black people are angry and we've always been angry. Whether legitimate or not , Generation z will have grown up seeing their family members and others being gunned down by white police. Hispanics will have seen their families torn away from them will white people unanimously subsidize it by putting trump in office.  If you think our current generation is " radical", just wait until these kids grow up , and grow up in an america where they are the majority and have the political power. AL we need to do is look at south Africa to see the logical conclusion of the outcome of such division and anger, and it wot end well for whites ,unfortunately.  Hopefully , I'll live to see this happens and when whites cry out about being oppressed , I'll tell you exactly what you told me : STOP BEING A VICTIM. STOP MAKING EXCUSES. PULL YOURSELF UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS. BRO, WE'RE POST RACIAL . ONE OF OUR PRESIDENTS WAS WHITE. ANTI BROWN PROPAGANDA AND BROWN GUILT. IT'S OK TO BE BROWN.  BROWN PRIVILEGE IS AN ANTI BROWN MYTH. BRO, YOURE A RACIST.

HAHAHAHAHAHA. I can't fucking wait to be honest. I wish no I'll will on no man,but I'm afraid whites will have to experience exactly what we have for it to ever be real to them . Shared experiences breed empathy.

[M4F] Then, 150 Years Ago or Now Then:
One hundred and fifty years ago, on Saturday nights, the loggers would pack little suitcases with their better clothes, catch the down-river boat, and come to town for weekend excitement. They’d get a bath, shave, and a haircut: change their clothes, get a shoeshine and head for the dance halls. “Oh ya sure,” the unofficial centenarian historian said. “We had 5 different girlie houses around town. Der was the same number of saloons, churches, and girlie houses—five.”

Now:
Drum sounds came from the dusty speakers in the dark ceiling. The drums were out of tune and distracting, his eyes and mind closed for a moment and he missed the stripper hitting the single harsh spotlight on the round stage. Her name was Kitty.  She wore a low-cut hunter green, satin gown with spaghetti straps, a hem that brushed the floor and a long slit in the front of the skirt that reached her pussy. A single saxophone joined the drums, ‘Waaa wot wot wa naaaaaaa …’ The stripper, had broad shoulders and an all around ample body, BMI about 25. She held her shoulder length red hair behind her head with two hands, leaned toward the audience, and swayed her ample tits currently ensconced in a sequined cream colored bra under her gown.

Other men with dilated pupils were sitting at tables surrounding the stage and had bills in hand and at the ready. He felt nothing. The stripper kicked not very high and not in beat with the sax, and the ABCs of maleness, actuary, builder, cabbie, whistled and applauded.  He, the 50 year-old— never fuck your graduate student—drive across town to the dive strip joint—professor, sat numb.

Now the stripper, who had yet to remove her gown, leaned directly towards his rimless glasses. Clutching his brown bottle of Miller Lite with both hands, his gaze bounced between her face and her cleavage. He wondered if those spaghetti straps were made with carbon fiber reinforcement. He wondered about the stripper’s story. He thought she looked kind, about his age but it was difficult to tell in the harsh light and heavy make-up. There was no lust, no fantasy of her riding his cock while her breasts bounce in front of him, and when her performance ended, he left a tip, slipped into the darkness of the audience and found the front entrance.

Years ago, after he and his wife of 30 years divorced, he bought an old two story stone boathouse. He kept his rowing sculls below. Upstairs, the rooms are defined more by furnishings than by walls. With windows all around, the views of the water were a good match for his needs. The back part of the boathouse was a workshop normally used for boat repairs, but at the moment, a wooden racing single scull was bent around its forms, spiral wood shavings on the floor, the aroma of cedar mixing with the aroma of fresh baked cookies filled the space. Now at home, he grabbed cookies, and lit two candles on the fireplace mantel and a short stubby old blue candle on the prairie bench that served as a coffee table.  He could have been Doc in Steinbeck's Cannery Row saying “Hah! There’s nothing in the world like that first taste of beer.”

He gazed at lights from the marina across the water and let his mind wander—to women—the graduate student in his Tuesday lecture, older student, glasses, wearing a long black maxi skirt with a slit up the side, never stops making eye-contact: the realtor who found this boathouse for him and who likes being on top and wearing her heels to bed: the visiting professor of Contemporary American Literature who has a propensity for exquisite Italian underwear: the smart woman he worked with on the Sander’s campaign.

He wondered if any of these interesting women were thinking about him when he heard the unlocked door open, the unmistakable clink of beer bottles and the rich voice calling, “Anyone home?”

S550 Mustang gt air/fuel ratios? New owner of a 2017 Mustang gt. Love the car, but have a few concerns. I guess these cars come with a a/f gauge as a feature, and I want to know what you guys typically see from it. At first I thought it was the intake that buddy installed on it, so I switched it back to the stock airbox when I got home. This did not change any of my numbers. It seems until about 4500-5k rpm that it stays around 14.0 under WOT and then starts to go way rich towards redline, I saw it down to 10 at one point. My concern is that it stays in the 14 range when accelerating, the car is completely covered under warranty but I obviously want to keep it running in good shape without blowing it up. I'm going to be making a dyno appointment shortly and see if they can tweak it a bit. I called a Ford service tech and he really had no idea what it should be, other than he assured me if anything was wrong, I'd get a CEL on my dash, which there isn't one. What's your guys' opinion? Where do your ratios hang around? Do you think it's something to be concerned about or is it something ford did for fuel economy? Thanks

2003 Ford Explorer Limited 4.6L I noticed lately that my car is getting pretty sluggish. Its off and on. Somedays I will get a fast response (when the car is cool or when its colder outside) verses after driving for some bit. Like when I got WOT it will hesitate and then it will start go but the pull isn't very strong until as I get higher in the RPM, the engine will sorta hesitate and begin pulling harder like as if someone just forced more air into the engine. I did remove the muffler on the vehicle and had it replaced with a pipe.  Though since then, I also noticed my car's cats pop alot and when you go down near them, it sounds like theirs liquid in the cat causing popping and bubbling sound (sounds like putting food in hot oil).

1990 Olds Touring Sedan DOA Howdy all, I could really use some insight on my ill-advised new vehicle purchase. It is a 1990 Oldsmobile 98 Touring Sedan with the LN3 3800 &amp; 4 Speed auto. While driving I have noticed the following:

1. Seems to run smooth, although idles high but has very little power, even at WOT. WOT in lower gears produces stumbling and misfire but not in 3rd.

2. Transmission will shift into 4th and lockup the torque Converter for a few miles, then unlock in 4th and never go back in. Sometimes restarting it will reset it but it immediately returns.

3. Sometimes taking off from stop, car will lag and hesitate, like it's in a higher gear. Shutting it off (or letting it die) running shifter through gears, restarting may clear it up. It will start and immediately die several times during this.

4. It started stalling, misfiring badly, then found water pump pulley had just broken off and chucked the belt while trying to climb a grade.

Please help, I'm 900 miles from home lol

R6 is kicking too abruptly.. anyone else dealt with this before? *Video included* video: https://youtu.be/ZO7-hTZZ0Mo
bike: 2003 R6
I noticed this happening this weekend... every time I would set up for a corner and get ready to gas up it would kick so aggressively and I would have to feather the clutch to smooth the entry as much as I could.

I'm almost certain what is causing this is the 'short twist tube mod' I just did. But I do not want to remove it. I epoxied a ziptie around the tube, underneath the cable. So it shortened the turn maybe a 1/4 in at most. I'm hoping I can settle it with some adjustment at the throttle body... or maybe fuck with the fuel injection settings using a power commander?
I broke my wrist over a year ago and I lost some motion. So it's driving me insane that I have to readjust my hand any time I want to go WoT.
This mod solved my first problem... but looks like it caused me a new problem...

** Also have a crack in my exhaust right before the slip-on...not sure if the exhaust leak might also be throwing something off...


Any ideas on how to correct this?

GAMES WORKSHOPS IS A BUNCH A EDGY GITS,TIS WOT REALLY HAPPENED TO MAKARI AND NOBODY CAN CONVINS ME UHDDERWISE!!(courtesy of 1D4chan) "Oi, Boss, where ya goin'?" asked Graknob, before a sharp smack to the back of the head from one of his fellow Nobs silenced him. Ghazghkull Thraka, greatest Ork Warlord the Orkoid race has ever seen, did not even stop in his plodding steps as he walked away from his main tent in the camp. Some of the boyz had objected to moving the Waaagh off course to visit this small, unknown, out of the way planet. 'Itz already been smashed, why we'z goin' here?' some had asked, but never loud enough for the boss to hear. The Nobz waited for their mega-armored warboss to be out of earshot before answering the new member of Ghazghkull's retinue.
"'E's off rememberin'" said one, an old Ork named Griksnak who had served their boss for many many years.
"'E can remember jus' fine round 'ere. What's 'e rememberin'?" asked the curious Nob, uncaring of the death-stares he was receiving from his fellow Nobz.
"Think 'bout it dis way, ya git. Us Orks love ta fight, yeah?"
"Yeah, even a snotling knows dat!"
"But da boss keeps sendin' us 'gainst da 'umies. Dis is cuz 'e hates dem. Now, why'd da boss hate 'umies?"
Graknob remained silent for a few seconds, pondering the question he was asked. "Cuz dey got ugly faces?"
The other Nobz just shook their heads. "'E lost someone ta 'em." Graknob looked around, confused. Everyone knew it didn't matter if an Ork died, he just got belched back into another body. He couldn't understand the feeling of loss.
Ghazghkull had shed most of his mega armor by the time he got to the top of the hill. Being an Ork, the act of removing armor seemed... unusual, to say the least, but it seemed appropriate to approach this site somewhat vulnerable. After all, he was meeting with the one being he knew would never harm him.
"'ey. Uhh... not sure what's I suppose'ta say 'ere. Jus' wanted tah, y'know, say 'ello. See how ya's was. Dose 'umies who got dat lucky shot off on ya? Yeah, dey dead. 'Dere planet is dead. Got lotsa da bastards. 'Ope dat helps out somehow. Wells... I's be goin', den. I... I misses ya, boy." Ghazghkull Mag Thraka turned and began walking down the hill again, leaving the grave he had been speaking to behind. A grave that simply said:
Makari

Banna Wava

Everyone knew Orks were belched back into another body after they died. Not Gretchin though. No Gretchin could ever replace Makari.


Now let's all discuss why the hell games workshop had him die in a dumb as fuck way such as being sat on and why do they have such a hard on for not letting anything be happy for WUN GORK DAMD SECUND

Suggest a thumper I rode a friend's XT600 the other day and it reminded my how much I enjoy road-trail bikes. Thinking I'd like to get another one as my next, or possibly second bike. Most of my riding is on the road, but I really like the relatively light weight, torque, go-anywhereness, tiny turning circle etc of trail bikes. So road-registerable models (Japan) only. Budget is fairly open. I'm looking at new or lightly used. I've ridden, mostly road bikes, for about 20 years. 178 cm tall, 75kg (5'10", 165 lbs). Current bike is a 2012 Street Triple R.

I previously owned a DRZ400E with motard conversion, and a DR650. I loved the DRZ, but it really needed a 6th gear. The DR was nice too but a little heavy and tractorish for my taste.

I live in Tokyo, so I'm leaning towards a 250 for practicality (most of my riding is commuting), and because they don't require vehicle inspections every two years. Unfortunately, some nice Japanese thumpers available in US/Aus aren't sold domestically in Japan, eg: https://www.yamaha-motor.co.jp/mc/lineup/

Amongst the 250s, the WR250R/X seems to stand out, but they're a little spendy for what they are, and not manufactured any more. CRF250L/M/Rally seem decent, if a bit low on power. I commuted a CBR250R with the same engine for a while, which was surprisingly fun to wind out. WOT everywhere.

Then there's the 225s like the Serow (XT225) etc, and the one with the big dual headlights with the name I can't remember :) Haven't ridden one yet but I suspect I'll want a bit more grunt.

Then there's the bigger bikes. The Husqvarna 701 Supermoto is pretty tempting, although it's way more bike than I can realistically use. Was excited by the announcement of the CRF450L, but 18kW from a 450, and that price.. wtf?

Throw out your suggestions!

Advice on spark knock at WOT I have a 2008 GT with long tube headers, off-road x-pipe, and JLT series CAI. I am finishing up with a custom Lito tune and his only concern was some spark knock on the high end. First thing he thought it could be was exhaust rattling and the knock sensors being sensitive enough to pick it up as knock. I checked under the car and found nothing rattling/rubbing, only thing I found was that the driver side header would vibrate when banged on (likely because of the length of the tubing). We've proceeded with tuning and I have my final tune now, but he left it up to the Bullitt strategy my car is running to manage the spark knock on the top end. What things should I look into? Is this normal behavior from this car? Thanks.

Owner of new 2019 Mustang GT but question on break in period and this oil catch can The manual says not to labor the engine for the first 1000 miles, switch gears early, but to vary the speed frequently. As someone who has never owned a car that had less than 80k miles on it before today (3 miles off the lot), I'm confused. If I'm shifting at low RPMs, and the RPMs are staying low, what difference does varying the speed do, and what does that even entail? Does it want me to stick to roads with lots of stop signs? I got a little ahead of myself today and revved it to about 4k in second and third during WOT; I hope this didn't hurt anything (I wanted to see what she could do, dammit). It also states to avoid heavy use of the brakes and clutch. Brakes is self explanatory but the clutch part sparks a question on what it means by "heavy use." Does that mean just don't pop the clutch and launch the car? It's a 6 speed and it wants me to vary my speed and shift early so the clutch is going to get a work out. I'm sorry if these may seem like obvious answers, but this is my first brand new car and I want to be certain.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the catch can. I'm trying to do my homework on this thing and am seeing varying answers (from snake oil to essential). My research has led me to conclude that the coyote has a fair amount of oil blow by, but unless the engine is just DI, it doesn't seem to be an issue. So, at least for the break in, I'm leaning towards this being a non issue, and at the worst case I can just  tear it down and clean it after 50k miles. Unfortunately I think I may just get more of what I've read, but I had to ask about it. I don't remember this ever being an issue on my 95 GT but I also had the PCV valve removed.

Jerry's adventure with Keith Moon who crawled along the ledge and knocked on Jerry's window at the Navarro Hotel...Mayhem ensues... This is a hilarious story from Rock Scully's book "Living With the Dead"


We're staying at the Navarro on Central Park south in New York, a hotel the Who have been trying to sell us for years. They own a third of it or something. We've got adjoining rooms. Jerry and I are spending a quiet evening in the global village, working on our hobbies: recreational drugs and watching TV. The eternal, endlessly shape-shifting box. Its nature changes with each new drug. With grass you want to turn the sound off and play records, on acid everything that happens on the set is uncannily calibrated to each fleeting thought. You are TV. With coke, you talk over it, talk back at it, shoot it dead if need be-it's alive!

Tap-tap-tap.

"Did you hear that?" I ask.

"Yeah man, what was that?"

It's...something...outside the window!

The thing about blow is it breeds paranoia. It's contagious! There are enough demons flapping through our bains as it is without some alien entity crouching on our windowsill forty stories up, tap-tap-taping on my casement window. I don't want to engage Garcia's alarm system over nothing, but this is, let's face it, a critical situation. It's one of those dread occasions where you need another human being to tell you you're imagining the whole thing. I know from bitter experience Jerry isn't that guy, nevertheless...

Knap! Knap! Knap!

"Jesus! There it is again."

"Turn the set off, man, so we can hear the damn thing." Good! Jerry's being very sensible about the whole thing.

"It's probably a pigeon," I suggest. "It could be anything."

"It could be anything?"

BANG! BANG! BANG!

"Holy shit! It must be fuckin' huge!"

"Jerry, we're on the forty-first floor!"

Jerry's not taking any chances. He assumes "the shield position" from the high school manual What to Do in Case of a Nuclear Attack, crouching down on his knees under the writing desk.

"You go check it out Rock."

Oh, thanks. And if you see my head getting chewed off by a fucking gigantic mutant mantis be sure to call the front desk and inform them so it doesn't disturb the other guests.

What, me worry? It's a game. It's something the Imp of blow has cooked up in our overscorched brains. It's just going to be some bird with a broken wing or something. And when it sees me-a bug-eyed teeth-grinding human-it's going to be scared out of its wits.

I pull back the curtains with a dramatic flourish. And, there, outside the window I see-fearsome popping eyes! the demented predatory grin! -the fiend itself!

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"

That Clockwork Orange orb of a face could only belong to-Keith Moon! The demon drummer of the Who is blithely grimacing back at me from his precarious perch. I pull open the window and let him in.

"Keith, what the hell are you doing out there?"

In a barely recognizable imitation of the Bard he drones: "May I pleeeeeease crawl in your window, baby?"

Because he's so paranoid from doing blow in his room alone all night he's double-bolted his door, forgotten that he's done it, and is too stoned to figure out how to open it. Calling the front desk in this state might arouse unwanted questions and quite logically he decides to inch along the ledge between out connecting rooms.

"Come in and do a few lines, maan," Jerry says sweepingly. The euphoria of relief and surprise in the room is intoxicating.

"Don't mind if I do."

Snoooooort!

"Wot abowt goin' out an' creatin' some, havoc! eh, lads?" The eyes of Moon are like asteroids of Saturn whirring in their own lunar orbits. They're independant entities, a sort of coke-crazed pair of quasi-human agents-an amped up Tweedledee and Tweedledum-and both of them want to go to Studio 54, now!

Jerry generally never wants to go out once we get to New York. He likes to vegitate in his room with the big color TV until showtime. New York is way too much input, it's abrasive and intimidating to Californians-especially Californians as high as we are. But Moon is fearless. He's a force of nature, he's unstoppable! Jerry loves Moon. He has an abiding affection for maniacs, Keruakian roman candles: "The mad ones, the ones who are mad to live...exploding like spiders across the stars," etc.

In the company of Moon, all apprehensions about New York vanish. Hey don't mess with us, we're with the Tasmanian Devil!"

Garcia's suddenly very animated: "Oh, we're going out? Cool! I'll just go get my coat." He leaves.

Moon's wheels are spinning. He wants to go out to that discotheque, Studio 54, but he's forgotten his stash. And he must have the stuff. It's his familar. So he goes out in the hall and uses his key in the door but naturally it won't unlock. All that coke has frozen his memory cells.

Out in the antiseptic hallway with the carpet with the matching deep-pile burgundy borzoi pattern, the Mad Hatter of the Who ponders to himself' "How could this have happened? Hmmmmm, let's see. I'm out of the room but yet it's bolted, you say, from the inside?"

Chief Inspector Moon voice: "One o' them locked-room mysteries is wot it is." He comes back into my room.

"You climbed along the ledge, remember?" I remind him.

"Fuck yeah! But wot to do, eh? I'm not goin' owt on that bloody precipice again, I can tell you that!"

It's a quandry all right. While I make a few phone calls, Mood disappears into the bedroom. More tapping! This time it sounds like a giant rat caught in the walls and clawing its way out, which, when I go in there to see what's going on, turns out to be pretty close.

There he is, the giant rat of Sumatra, busily gnawing away-urr-urrr-urrr-urrrr-in my clothes closet. There's dust all over my clothing, lumps of the wall all over the floor.

"What the hell you doin' in there?"

"My room's right next door, mate."

"You're goin' through the wall?"

"Wot uvver alternatives do you recommend?"

"Jesus, Moon, it's only drugs!"

"You should hear yourself, Scully."

"Can't we get more of whatever it is, man? I mean it's not ibogaine, is it? Or extract of Madagascar tree toad venom?"

He doesn't hear me. He's a man possessed. He's stripping the plaster off the wall with a buck knife. He's got that mad Jack-Nicholson-with-the-ax look-here's Johnny! He's a miracle of enthusiasm. Now he's got the plaster off and he's down to the lathe and bricks.

"Won't be a moment," he says and splits. Am I being too optimistic to think he's abandoned the project? Gone to raid Pete Townsend's stash, most probably? But no, it's too good to be true. He goes downstairs to the basement and comes back up with a chisel and a hammer. He's taking the bricks out one by one.

"I own a third of this hotel, y'know,' he says by way of explanation. He's going, "God, I'm gonna get in so much trouble for this!" But he doesn't care, he's pounding away at it! He's determined to get back into his room and get his drugs.

Jerry comes back and goes in to take a look. He's standing there looking at this devastation. "What? Jesus! Moon's turned into some kind of human mole!'

Finally the hole is big enough. Moon wriggles through it, gets his stash and crawls back through the hole, once again forgetting to open his door. He's now covered with dust from head to toe, like a ghoul recently exumed from from a graveyard.

My family is going to kill chickens. Wot do I do? I’m a teen... not an adult yet.. so I live with my parents. I live in a small, conservative, tiny town in the middle of nowhere near the arctic (I still manage to find vegan food though lol). Wild bears here are everywhere... and hunters here are everywhere. There’s shops all over for skinning, taxidermy, meat packaging, etc. Shops all over selling animal furs... I’m sort of desensitized to it. Sadly, since moving here, everyone in my family wants to hunt now too. When I was little my dad told me a story about how he went hunting and shot a rabbit with an arrow. He said the rabbit didn’t die... so he was thoroughly disturbed and he said that’s when he decided he would never hunt another wild animal again. He has since changed his mind and now goes moose hunting and plans on killing a bear with my family. Nothing I can really do about that... when I try to talk to him about it he thinks I’m manipulating him. He always tries to get me to eat meat again and he says it’s insulting when he cooks a meal that his child won’t eat it. Since moving up here my parents have also decided to get chickens... they asked me about how I felt about it about six months back. They told me “we will buy the chickens and you will take care of them. We will treat them like pets... they way we treat our dog. We will only use them for eggs that’s it.” I said no because I know I’m not responsible enough to take care of chickens and this always happens. I feel like I’m always taking care of things my parents don’t want to. I told them we can’t because chickens are too much responsibility and work. But they kept saying that they PROMISE no harm will come to them if they get chickens. Fast forward a couple of months they still talk about getting chickens. A few days ago we were sitting around the fire talking about getting chickens (still said it wasn’t a good idea) and my dad tells me that he has decided to get them... and he has also decided to kill them and eat them. He said that he felt I was controlling him and he was like “you don’t want to control me right?” Seeking my validation. I’m not going to tell him it’s okay to kill them and I think this is really shitty. Promising me for months that you won’t kill the chickens and of course he plays the “I felt manipulated” card. He always does that... I don’t want to raise chickens for slaughter.. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be involved at all... but I don’t want to see chickens die. Sorry this is so long I needed to vent.

Note: I don’t hate my parents.. they are just difficult to live with a lot of the time. But they buy me vegan food and sort of support me being vegan (if you ignore them trying to get me to eat meat). I have had a lot of crazy issues with them in the past though.

TLDR: my parents are buying chickens and have decided to kill them eventually after promising me they wouldn’t for months and idk what to do.

10th gen si. Loss of power after installation. I recently installed an acquity pedal spacer in my si which you have to disconnect the connector going to the gas peddle.  The first time I tried accelerate while rolling with wot, I couldn't feel the same pull that it once had.  The only answer I found is to unplug my battery and let my cpu reset with no indication as to why this is necessary.  idk if that is bullshit or not, but it couldn't hurt to try it tomorrow.

Kind of just looking for some troubleshooting help.  I don't think I should have to reset my cpu but I'm not a mechanic.  At night, all the boost is there so I don't think this is a cpu problem but probably due how hot it is outside which creates poor performance?   I live in the south and during the day time, it hits around 100 ish.

at night when its cooler, the car and boost operate normally so i'm betting on the weather impacting performance but not sure.  If it is the weather, do any other 10th gen si members experience this too?

The game crashes my new xbox one s, and shuts down the entire console In the morning when I come downstairs for my coffee, I turn on my new xbox one s, and I go to launch WoT, it comes up with a black screen, then about 20 seconds later my xbox shuts down.

I cannot turn my xbox back on from the controller, I have to get up and hit the button on the front of the unit. Weird, right?

Then when it comes up and I launch the game, I don't get a black screen, I get the initial startup image and everything works just fine.

It's been doing this for weeks now, and I've done a little troubleshooting to try to figure it out. It seems that once I get it up and running I can go to another app and return to it just fine. I can shut it down by pressing the whatever button on the icon and selecting 'kill' or 'end' or whatever it says. I can then relaunch it. This leads me to believe it has something to do with the sleep mode that it goes into when I "shut down" my xbox. (I'm only now realizing this and will test this scenario).

Does anyone else have this issue?

TPS causing rough idle(?) 98 Dodge Dakota 5.2L

&amp;#x200B;

Replaced the plenum and intake gaskets to fix oil consumption and rough idle. Idle did not improve, but RPMs are steady around 700 and gas mileage is fine.  Intake manifold pressure drops from 14 psi car off to 5.5 psi car on which correlates to 17 inHG so no vacuum leaks.

 On my OBD scanner, the throttle position says \~13% when idling and only \~75% when the pedal is to the floor. Is this somehow preventing the car from opening the IAC thingy and getting choked out at idle?

I'm also not sure if it recognizes if I'm trying to accelerate at WoT, like it shifts down and RPMs up, but not into the lowest possible gear bringing RPMs near the max (or is this not a feature on this car).

&amp;#x200B;

Parts that have been replaced: spark plugs &amp; wires, air filter, intake &amp; plenum gaskets, PCV grommet and valve, TB gasket (and carb cleaned TB), and TPS sensor

&amp;#x200B;

Compression tested fine, \~150psi all cylinders dry.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help!

q50 3.0t pile of trash less than 5k miles, 4200 to be exact. I need to piston rings as I am waiting for my car engine to be rebuilt by the dealer.

&amp;#x200B;

thought it was a PCV valve or someshit- turns out you need to wait a few thousand miles &amp; baby the car until you break it in. Wtf? I got a lease and I wanted to push the car asap. YES I did abuse it a bit and had a ton of fun on it, but it sits in traffic 90% of time (nyc) . Out of the 4200 miles I'd say I WOT the car about 200-400 miles ( prolly less ). This is my daily driver and I drive to work in traffic everyday. First my serpentine belt snaps because the manufacturer fucked up the pulley alignment , now I gotta replace the piston rings? Seriously Infiniti? I thought the car would be more reliable than this. I'll keep you guys updated.

Name the best supercar ever made and why. Going back to the God Father of supercars in the Lamborghini Muira all the way up to the Bugatti Chiron.... which one is the best and why?

It could be based which one you like the best, or based on, performance, rarity, innovation, or whatever you want.

For me, it has to be the McLaren F1. It checks all the boxes and is the holy grail of all cars for me. Other than it being absolutely beautiful, here are some reasons why it is the best of all time.

 - Rarity: 64 roadcars ever made. Only a handful in the U.S. 6 LM's and 3 GT's (including prototypes).

- Value: They were sold for around 1 million in 1993, which at the time was a first for a car. They continue to go up in value today and are worth anywhere from 12 million to 25 depending on the model. I think one day one of these could outsell a 250 GTO.

- Innovation: Plenty of that here. The very first supercar to use all carbon fiber. The very first car to have a top speed of 240 mph. It is still the fastest naturally aspirated car (top speed) in the world which is quite an accomplishment considering these cars are over 20 years old.

Driver sits in the middle for that F1 feel and expierence. Truely unique.

Lightest materials were used throughout with a weight coming in around 2500 pounds, which is signifcantly lighter than every supercar being made today.

The car actually had a decent amount of luggage space potential with 2 sides trunks. Rear visibilty is ok. The F1 is actually somewhat practical given what it is and what it can do. (Getting in and out was certaintly not practical at all).

- Engine: That 6.1 BMW V12 is a thing of beauty. The sounds it makes at WOT is like anything on this planet. It has also shown to be very durable.

- Aerodynamics: The F1 featured a dynamic rear spoiler that would activate during braking. Back in 1993, technology like this was unheard of. Today it is very standard for active areo in supercars to improve downforce.

- Safety: Did very well in the crash testing before going into production. There have been some F1 crashes, and everyone has walked away from it.

Racing: Contrary to some popular believe, the F1 was designed as the ultimate road car with no intentions of racing. Despite it being a road car, it was able to enter 24 hours of LeMans later on and win against faster purpose built prototypes in 1995. The F1 GTR's top 5 place finish spawned the LM in order to celebrate.

The F1 is one incredible car, and I think it deserves the title of king of the supercars. So what do you guys think? Does it derserve that title? If not, which supercar do you think is the best?

Name the best supercar ever made and why it's a Miata Going back to the God Father of supercars in the AE86 all the way up to a Skyline.... which one is the best and why?

It could be based which one you like the best, or based on, performance, rarity, innovation, or whatever you want.

For me, it has to be the Mazda Miata. It checks all the boxes and is the holy grail of all cars for me. Other than it being absolutely beautiful, here are some reasons why it is the best of all time.

Rarity: Only 1000000 of them have ever been made, so they're not hard to find

Value: Dirt cheap. $5k-$25k, very accessible. The value can only go up from here! Some day, one of these may be worth like a million dollars.

Innovation: Not much of that here. Easy to mod. It's still the slowcarfastest naturally aspirated car in the world which is quite an accomplishment considering some of these cars are over 20 years old.

Driver sits on the driver's side for that F1 feel and expierence. Truely unique.

Lightest materials were used throughout with a weight coming in around 2400 pounds, which is signifcantly lighter than every supercar being made today.

The car actually had a decent amount of luggage space potential with about 5 cubic feet of storage in the trunk. Rear visibilty is ok, better with no top. The Miata is actually somewhat practical given what it is and what it can do. (Getting in and out was certaintly not practical at all).

Engine: That tiny inline 4 is a thing of beauty. The sounds it makes at WOT is like anything on this planet. It has also shown to be very durable.

Aerodynamics: The Miata featured a passive rear spoiler that would activate during all operations. Back in 1989, technology like this was unheard of. Today it is very standard for areo in supercars to improve downforce.

Safety: Did very well in the crash testing before going into production. There have been some Miata crashes, and almost everyone has walked away from it.

Racing: Contrary to some popular believe, the Miata was designed as the ultimate road car with no intentions of racing. Despite it being a road car, Mazda was able to enter 24 hours of LeMans later on and win against faster purpose built prototypes in 1991. (That was a 787B, but it's pretty much a Miata.)

The Miata is one incredible car, and I think it deserves the title of king of the supercars. So what do you guys think? Does it derserve that title? If not, go fuck off back to /r/powerwheels.

WOT after a stall? How soon after a stall can one resume wide open throttle driving? I stalled before takeoff on an auto cross and basically just sent it right away. Kinda smelled burning right after but no warning lights or anything, oil and coolant temps remained stable. Is that a problemo?

Intermittent Hard Starting Hi Everyone,

I'm having a very intermittent hard starting/long cranking issue.  It happens only about 1 in 50 starts, usually when the engine is warm.  No other performance issues once it's started.

I checked a few parameters with a scan tool.  Most looked normal,  but I did notice the fuel pressure dropping about 1psi/second after the car was shut off.  Also, when the key was turned to the on position (not started) the fuel pressure didn't increase it was at \~36psi and didn't increase until the engine was started.  Is fuel pressure leak down normal?

&amp;#x200B;

Other parameters for reference:

Long Term Fuel Trim is \~3%

Idle Fuel Pressure: \~580psi

O2 /AFM went slightly rich at WOT

C6 Z06 running rich, stock with AHP Package 4 heads? When I bought my 2008 Z06 (bone stock except for the AHP fixed heads) I had it inspected by a mechanic, who said it was running a little rich (presumably at idle, not WOT).  It seems to blacken the tailpipes after a while and now even having gone 3 weeks without washing, it looks like light coat of soot/carbon on the back of the car above the tailpipes.  The smell of unburnt fuel isn’t really there too much when standing behind the car, although it’s perceptible if you pay attention for it.


How rich do these LS7’s run stock? The guy said this sometimes happens with cars that sit for a while (25k miles over 10 years) and that the MAF probably needs to be cleaned out. Any truth to this?

    Ozzy is sick and fed up of the same old porn, he's fapped to Fivefapsatfreddy's, Shadbase, even Undertail, so he wants to make his own hentai.
    Ozzy: But who?

    Chapter 1: A Broken Timeline
    Freddy is enjoying his day, like a normal bear, he sits on a chair and starts browsing his favorite subreddit, /r/GODZILLA
    What, did you think it was gonna be fucked up? It's too early for that you /r/asshole
    HA! GOTCHA!!!
    Either way, Freddy's tv suddenly spits out two humans
    Spring: ACK!!!
    Dank: Bloody fuckin' ell!
    Freddy: Who the fuck are you guys!?!
    Spring: I'm Springlocked, that's Dank.
    Dank: Hi
    Freddy: What are you doing here???
    Spring: Something has fucked up in the timeline, we need to gather your fellow children...
    Freddy: Kids?
    Dank: Your brothers and sister!!!
    Freddy: Ok? I'm pretty damn bored, can this adventure take 8 months? 8 months... and a week?
    Spring: Why?
    Freddy: I'm just hyped for something, nothing you'd know about. My interests are weird.
    Spring: I'm sure we'd get it.
    Chapter 2: The Gathering.
    Freddy: So who's the first "child" we need to find?
    Dank: Ozzy, he's the most normal of us I'd say, he's the only one of us who hasn't killed someone yet.
    Freddy: Shudders
    Spring: This is his house
    The camera pans to a beautiful, modern, shiny, house.
    Dank: He's very cash money.
    As the trio enters the home, a bed is heard shaking from upstairs.
    Freddy: what the?
    Dank: It's probably the dog
    Spring: Ozzy doesn't have a dog, anymore, he cut it's nutsack off and ate it remember?
    Dank: Oh yeah...
    Freddy: Maybe Ozzy's jumping on his bed?
    Spring: his bed's right there.
    Pan to Ozzy's bed.
    Freddy: Oh, maybe his parents are jumping on their bed?
    Spring: Well, I'm his dad, and his mom's usually down here.
    The trio climb the stairs, and discover the source of the sound is coming from Ozzy's Mom's room.
    Spring: Who will do the honors?
    Dank: Not me.
    Freddy: Fine.
    Freddy creaks the doorknob, opening the door, and revealing.
    OZZY HAVING SEX WITH HIS MOM!!!!!!
    Freddy, Dank, and Spring: WHAT THE FUCK?!
    Ozzy: Hey! Get the fuck out of here! I've almost finished in her 50 times!
    Spring: WHAT THE FUCK OZZY!!! I DIDN'T RAISE YOU LIKE THIS!!!
    Ozzy: SHUT UP!!!
    Dank: How long have you been doing this?!
    Ozzy: Just about... 7 hours.
    Freddy: Heh, up top my guy.
    Spring: Ozzy, you can fuck her later, we have a timeline to repair.
    Ozzy: Just one more time! Please!
    Spring: Fine...
    Chapter 3: A visit.
    Spring: Ozzy, I'll admit, I can see why you did that, she is certainly worth it.
    Ozzy: Fuck yeah dad!!!
    Spring: OK, so we have to visit the graveyard, I have something I need to do there.
    Freddy: What is it?
    Spring: It's just a thing I need to get.
    Freddy: Gotcha
    As the heroes enter the graveyard, they pass two graves, one labeled "RUSTY S. CAN" the other "FROBY F II"
    Spring approaches the one labeled "FROBY" He picks up a piece of paper.
    Spring: The piece of truth, the nuke, our last hope to fix this timeline. Circus Baby hentai...
    Ozzy: Now why in Godzilla's name do we need that?
    Spring: Read it, who do you think created this?
    Ozzy: Someone close to Froby...
    Spring: Bearend
    DRAMATIC STING GOES HERE...
    Dank: No... NO... NOOOOO!!!!
    Spring: He betrayed us... Made a laughingstock out of our good friend. He's our enemy.
    Freddy: This will stop him?
    Spring: In a way, yes.
    Chapter 4: A visit with WUT
    Spring: Here, I know someone who, may, help
    Spring leads the group to a bar. He knocks on the door a strange way, as Winduptoys comes out.
    Winduptoys: Fuck you
    He slams the door.
    Spring: welp.
    Chapter 5: Roads not Traveled, very often.
    Spring: Ok, Ok, that didn't work out well, at all. We need to find someone who can decipher where he is.
    Dank: That sign says "Location Man Only 69 cents"
    Spring: Wha, Whaaaaa?
    Freddy: I'd assume he can find Bearend.
    Spring: ok.
    The Trio heads towards the man though is location is on a road not often traveled.
    Ozzy: Jeez, this road isn't traveled very often... Is it?
    Dank: Seems not.
    Location Man: BOO, YOU GUYS!
    Spring: ACK!!!
    Gigan: Aw, don't be scared, You guys. It's just me! Gigan!
    Spring: Aw, ya spooked me ya bloody chicken!
    Freddy: Can you find the creator of this art?
    Gigan: Hmmm..... He's, that way, keep going north, and take a left at 56 clicks, then keep going for 78 clicks, and take a right, keep going for 43 clicks, turn left, he's right there.
    Spring: OK
    Chapter FINAL: Climatic Ending.
    Spring: He should be right here.
    Bearend flips around as his massive cock whacks Freddy in the head.
    Freddy: Bloody bitch!
    Bearend: So, ye asshats found me didya?
    Spring: You can't deny it! You killed Froby! Which ruined the timeline!!!
    Bearend: So I did... Or Did I?
    Suddenly, a piece of paper falls on Bearend's head.
    Bearend: Fuck *BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
    Spring: Well that worked out well.
    Epilogue
    All of the children, Spring, and Freddy return to their living in piece, Bearend dies, meaning when Froby is resurrected, he returns from the dead in peace, never ruining the timeline and forcing Spring and Dank to have the adventure (it's canon tho)
    THe Shitposting continues in peace, and Freddy's adventures was only a day off from 8 months and a week, poor fuck.
    A happy end for all.

When a HPFP goes out on a N54 or N55, what exactly breaks in the pump? I have a 2011 N55 E90 with 90k miles. After almost a year of long crank cold starts, 2 weeks ago my HPFP finally started spitting codes. It started with the car randomly going into limp mode on the freeway, but not actually showing the half-engine light or any other warning light. Upon turning the car off and back on again, everything was back to normal. Fast forward a few days, and this same thing is happening more frequently, with every other time popping a half-engine light. I have a re-man pump on its way from FCPEuro, so hopefully I’ll have this sorted by next week.

My question to those more technically inclined; what exactly goes out on the HPFP? Considering it hits 200 Bar on the regular, how can something like that slowly die instead of going completely out?

Also, will driving the car in limp mode for a week cause any further issues? The car is down on power, but not to the point where it isn’t driveable or runs like shit. I’m just worried about any lean situations considering the rail pressure is sitting at about 90psi at WOT in limp mode rather than 2600psi.

Thanks guys!

Tuning/Tuner info for Silverado's. Hello All,

I would like to start out by saying that I am only making this post to help inform all those who are wondering/pondering around these questions about improving your trucks. I'm not by any means bashing a purchase anyone has already made. I am only trying to help the forum with what I have learned with my own money and experience. And I WILL NOT, throw a specific person or company under the bus, I will only use generic terms.

So let me start off by saying I have purchased both the handheld programmers and custom tunes. Just like majority of us, I started off with a handheld programmer. It was even a programmer that had the capability to log your ecu/tcu while driving, not just a programmer that already had set tunes on it. So I did what you're supposed to do: log a few days of driving, send the file to the tuner for adjustments and then take another log (and so on and so forth). After a few exchanges of emails, and loading a few tunes...I finally had a fast truck! (or so I thought). Also note, at the time my truck had FBO (full bolt ons, intake, headers and exhaust).

Shortly down the road, I needed more speed. So I purchased a 3k stall converter, and had a buddy re-tune my truck with the software HP Tuners. Now this time my truck was being tuned, it was live in a friends driveway via a laptop. And so I got to see all the changes being physically made right in front of me. To note, the stall converter itself did not require much adjustment, just moving a few shift points around. But what I could not believe the most was, my tuner showed me that my truck at WOT (wide open throttle) was actually pulling LESS timing than a Stock tune...that obviously made me feel dumb and felt like a slap in the face because all this time the placebo effect must have fooled me. In fact, 14 degrees of timing is a lot less than 20+ degrees (from a stock tune). If I remember right, we were able to get about 24 degrees of timing safely.

Now with a true custom tune, HOLY COW. My truck was a SLUG before getting a street tune in person. Granted the stall converter did help a lot being under-geared with an old 4L60e trans, the custom tune was very noticeable up top and throughout the rpm band. Fuel mileage improved slightly, shift points were near perfect (would need a dyno to perfect), shift firmness was set to my liking and the truck jumped at any speed (no more hunting gears).

I did go on to put a custom cam in this truck from BTR, and increased the compression too. Was a fun daily driver for a year that's for sure, but unfortunately the truck rings were toast because it was burning a quart every 3 days. So I traded the 08 in for a 14 Silverado 5.3 LTZ. I see a lot of Chevy owners wondering if this tuner or that programmer is worth it, and just wanted to make one post we can all refer back to for reference.

To conclude: in my honest opinion, a handheld programmer/tuner that is not being adjusted in person on your vehicle specifically is almost never worth it. They are usually more expensive and just another set of safe variables for your vehicle to run on vs getting a true custom tune. Think about it, at the end of the day, a company doesn't want you to be calling them about your trans or engine blowing up, so it will never be pushed to its capability without being there in person. Because elevation, temperature, mileage, carbon buildup...all these variables lead to every engine needing something different to perfect its efficiency. Especially to the owners like me who are still within warranty on your truck, if you're going to risk breaking the warranty and spending the money...why not get the most for what you're already paying! And I understand that location may not be convenient for everyone, but for those of you within reach of a tuner...DO NOT PASS UP THE OPPURTUNITY! These DI 5.3l engines have a lot to be gained, I think its safe to say people are seeing an average of 20-25whp gains with a tune, and 30whp+ with 93 or e85. I almost have 80k on my 2014 right now, and so if the lifters and everything is still good next year, I will not hesitate to tune it the second my warranty is up!

Hope I helped at least 1 individual!

09 mazdaspeed 3 bucking at 3000 RPM - Help This issue started up 2 years ago and is frustratingly intermittent, but happens a few times a day. The car will violently lose power at 3000 RPM and forces me to let off the throttle for a second and then resume. It seems mostly to happen at WOT but will occasionally do it  when cold at any throttle position. Sometimes the check engine light would come on and the code was misfire on cylinder 3. I replaced the plugs and had Mazda inspect the coils which are good. They flashed the ECU and replaced the O2 sensor which seems to have stopped the check engine light from coming on, but the problem is not fixed. I also replaced all the coil packs recently and the issue got much worse, so I put the old ones back on and it is now back to the way it was - intermittently losing power.

Anyone else have this happen?

I used to think "Spend $20 on just one eyelash curler? wtf why would i do that when a drugstore one does the job fine and it's literally just curling your lashes"

Then i found the whole science behind different brands like the different radii for different eye shapes so I got a shu uemura one and it really is different- it curled my lashes so much better since the radius fit my eye shape better.
okay cool, i thought i was done. 20 bucks for a tool that's a great fit for me that im gonna use forever sounds like a good deal.

But i found out you have to replace your rubber pad every few months bc it loses its bounciness or whatever and replace the entire curler (some said in 6 months lmao wot fuck no) bc it can lose its optimal curling abilities bc its springs have gotten loose or whatever.


and now im throwing my hands up. like come ON. ik beauty companies say they're not just saying these stuff to make ppl buy more stuff like replacing your beautyblender every month is like (even 3 months is too soon personally?? if you wash it regularly and take care of it)??  okay under the guise of sanitary reasons i'll let it slide that that's what they formally put out there as a guide. but we all know a lot of the expiration dates on some cosmetics are suggestions like powder products last years and years if you keep them in dry places and take care of them well. (mascara and eye products-except powder eyeshadows- should have their expiration dates be heeded pretty strictly tho)

not that makeup doesnt have a shelf life and i dont accordingly discard stuff but sometimes i get uneasy when i think of expiration dates bc it creates this urgency of thinking my current one is defunct and i need to get a new one asap.
TO BE CLEAR i talked about makeup generally above but im thinking mostly of my  eyelash curler and when it feels like company experts are creating expiration dates for things that don't necessarily need it and what seems like just cash grabs to make consumers buy more often. ik cosmetics have a shelf life im not contending that. and yes you can def use up your optimal eyelash curling capabilities in a curler that's 10 years old, sure and im not that against the idea of replacing rubber pads once in a while.

But discard my eyelash curler when it has no defects or no reason for me to be dissatisfied with it other than it's "recommended"?
fucking no.
i bought another eyelash curler under this kind of mindset and almost bought more. not mad about the one i already bought but the fact im looking at buying a shiseido maquillage one ugghhh. it just brought me from a 'one is enough forever' to 'i wanna buy more' mentality and im kinda mad.


what do yall think about some expiration dates that maybe aren't even scientifically derived but just put there to make more money (e.g. beauty tools and that eyelash curlers should last SIX MONTHS WHO CAME UP WITH THIS NUMBER)

Experiencing throttle surge or something. Just checking to see if any one else has ran into this before I start troubleshooting. Past couple days my engine will continue to rev for 1-2 seconds after I let off the accelerator pedal and press in the clutch to shift.  It's not the built-in rev hang since it's actually increasing RPM rather than holding steady between shifts like it always has.  It's like there's lag between me letting off the pedal and when the ECU sets the throttle to closed.

For example, I'll rev 1st to 4k, let off gas and press in clutch and it will continue revving to like 5k or higher and then the car will lunge as I go into the next gear because the rpm is too high.  It's definitely worse if I'm really on it too.  If I got WOT in 2nd and shift at 5k it will redline when I press in the clutch.

Only engine mods are a Depo 3.5" IC, Green filter, and RS lid.  Symposer electrical connector is unplugged.  Had my oil and transmission fluid changed at the dealership like 2 weeks ago and the car has ran perfectly since then up until 2 days ago.  Car has 7001 miles on it.

Only thing I tried so far is to disconnect the negative terminal on the battery for over 30 minutes to reset ECU/KAM.  Checked oil and the level is perfect.  Boost gauge is reading like it always does.  Overboost activates properly.  Factory BPV sounds like it is activating.

Happened to anyone else?  Any suggestions to try before I have to take off work and head to the dealership?

2013 Mustang GT transmission tm82 This is more of an issue, but to provide some backstory on the situation..

In January, I purchased a used 2013 Mustang GT Premium. It has some modifications but I’m not 100% sure what’s been done so far. At the dealership they told me it has roughly 510 rwhp, but I haven’t had this confirmed. I took my vehicle to have the transmission fixed and they ended up replacing the transmission and telling me that, “Hey, we noticed you have an aftermarket clutch, we don’t touch those..” Also, it’s worth mentioning that the vehicle had the transmission issue from the day I purchased it, but was told by the dealership that was normal. I was enamored, I admit, and purchased it knowing something wasn’t right. Fast forward, I’ve got the vehicle back, and I can’t tell if the car just has a shit load of power, or if something is wrong.  I can’t give the car more than 10% of the pedal without it sounding like I’m wot. I can’t tell if it’s breaking lose with all the power, or if I’m running around with my clutch half cocked. Can anyone tell me if you’re vehicle behaves the same?

I just had a revelation about shifting that really helps with rev matching This is my first manual car so maybe this is common knowledge (I'm sorry if it is) but I thought I'd share for the rest of us. By knowing how fast your focus is going and what gear you want to rev match to, you can calculate what rpm you need to rev your engine to have nice and smooth rev match shift.

The equation: **RPM = Speed  ÷ (Gear Number x 5)**

Where:

* **RPM** is in thousands of revolutions per minute (4500 rpm = 4.5)
* **Speed** is in miles per hour (45 mph = 45)
* **Gear Number** is what gear you want to be (2nd gear = 2)

So for example if you're coming up to a corner at 45mph and you want to shift to second gear to have better acceleration after the turn, use the equation:

RPM = Speed  ÷ (Gear Number x 5)

Substituting the numbers in:

RPM = 45 ÷ (2 x 5) = 4.5 on tachometer

So engage your clutch, rev your engine to 4.5 on the tachometer, release your clutch, brake a little, make the turn, and go WOT out of the turn :D

It's very slightly off when you get into the higher gears so it takes a little practice to get the feel for it. Let me know if you have any questions or more tips to share!

Sōka Gakkai Families in the UK: Observations from a Fieldwork Study I covered this a while back, but since we've got a lot of UK people around now (and I'd forgotten about it), I thought it would be cool to put up a few excerpts in light of the recent "youth" recruitment drives both here in the US and there in the UK.  There's more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/5r2n5b/a_2015_research_paper_on_sgi_families_very/) - it's clearly a work of SGI apologetics, so be forewarned:

&gt;She also talked about the frequency with which meetings took place in the family home.

&gt;*It’s quite stressful when you’re a kid and every Sunday morning thirty people turn up at ten thirty ... When thirty to fifty people chant, it’s loud and all the neighbours know about it.*

&gt;Chanting is a vocal activity, not a silent meditation. It may be heard by the neighbours and it will certainly be heard within the household. It is a public act and difficult for children to avoid public association with it. **The majority of the young interviewees described times when they had hustled their friends upstairs to get away from a meeting.**

&gt;Younger children who cannot be left at home on their own also tend to be taken about to meetings in the homes of others. Since those others may be geographically distant this can mean extensive travel on a regular basis, especially if parents have leadership responsibilities and especially in rural areas where populations and, therefore, members are widely spread. **Some of the young people knew as soon as they were old enough to be left safely at home, that they wanted nothing more to do with SGI-UK meetings or practice.**

&gt;SGI-UK members do not understand their religion as divisive, and certainly not as a potential source for conflict within families. They are not cut off from their extended families because they chant.

Well, then they're *severely* myopic about the actual *effects* of their practice, as in the previous paragraph about the effects of it on children!  Now, if we're talking cartoonishly caricaturish, Jehovah's Witnesses/Mormon "cut-off-ness" (shunning), then no, but we ALL know how the self-involved practice of chanting necessarily isolates the person chanting.  You can't be both chanting AND having a conversation with a family member, now CAN you?

&gt;...it
can be challenging for a practicing parent with a non-practicing partner to find a balanced role for their religious practice within a family unit. **Expressions of distress about this particular tension** were heard at SGI-UK residential courses when members had a chance to relax in each other’s company.

&gt;Parents may recommend chanting to their children during discussions of problems. Examples of such problems that emerged in the interviews with parents included bullying at school, and problems with friendships. **All the parents in the study recognised that they risked censure from outside the movement and rebellion from their children if they appeared too persuasive. Unlike most other Buddhist convert traditions, Sōka Gakkai can be associated in the public mind with religious movements that are deemed to be dangerous, such as Aum Shinrikyo.** That association can have negative connotations for children that parents are anxious to avoid.

Yeah, coercion is *deeply* unpopular.  Bummer, wot?

&gt;**Social capital** is usually understood as giving rise, through various means, to economic benefits. For example, ordinary members of social groups, including religious groups, may use their membership to procure for their children access to educational benefits leading to increased earning power. They may tap into the economic wealth of other members to access job opportunities for their offspring. **The interview study detected no evidence of this occurring on a widespread basis in SGI-UK**...

That's HUGE - there is no "social capital" that distills from all the hours and hours of effort and chanting and meetings and activities and home visits and phone calls etc.

#SGI membership does not result in ANY of the normal, predictable benefits of a community.

Which makes the next section not surprising in the least:

&gt;Like the majority of young people in the UK (Savage et al., 2006: 123), the children of practicing SGI-UK members are generally not dissatisfied with life, and they need a compelling reason to start any religious practice, including chanting.

&gt;There is evidence, however, that many children of practitioners are not convinced that the rewards the practice offers are worth the effort. In this, SGI-UK is no different from other religions in the UK, including the stated religion of the majority. The reasons why many SGI-UK children do not take up the practice seem to be that they do not aspire to the things it offers or at least that they do not regard the things it offers to be worth the commitment of belonging or the time commitment required by assiduous chanting.

Ugh - "assiduous". That's not a word that's typically thrown around outside of the SGI. I'll bet you anything this researcher is a cultie.

&gt;Within SGI-UK, but outside of official sources there is a perception that dedication to the practice is diluted as it passes through the generations. A similar concern has been expressed in relation to the children of Wiccan practitioners. Stark has argued that **[when] “the retention of offspring is not favourable to continued growth, if it causes the group to reduce strictness”**.

&gt;Like Stark, SGI-UK members understand diminution of strictness in terms of ‘freeriding’ and diminution of zeal for the practice itself and for its spread.

&gt;UK members who fear this dilution as the practice passes to future generations may be influenced by what they know of the majority religion in the UK where **there is plenty of evidence that children are lukewarm about traditional religious practice**. Young people have been rejecting the Christian churches in the UK at a steeper rate than adult leavers throughout the twentieth century.

And it's no different in the SGI.

&gt;In recent decades, churches are said to have been ‘haemorrhaging’ or ‘bleeding to death’ because of the lack of young people.

Hence these ill-advised and *deeply* weird recruitment "festivals".

&gt;There is evidence, however, that **many children of practitioners are not convinced that the rewards the practice offers are worth the effort.** In this, **SGI-UK is no different from other religions in the UK**, including the stated religion of the majority. **The reasons why many SGI-UK children do not take up the practice seem to be that they do not aspire to the things it offers or at least that they do not regard the things it offers to be worth the commitment of belonging or the time commitment required by assiduous chanting. Young people may have the benefits they want already or may see other ways of getting them. The competitor of religion in the UK, whether of the majority or of this minority, may be that the goals the young look for may also be available through hard work and education.**

The original paper is [here](http://www.globalbuddhism.org/jgb/index.php/jgb/article/view/150/171) - you'll need to click on the ".PDF" box to have a look.  Warning:  It's pretty preachy.

Feedback Knock and Turbo, FA20 Help 2017 FA20. Every bolt on is accounted for in the current tune. BCP tune so safer than usual boost load I believe. Beaned it and slammed into neutral then stopped (Red light came sooner than expected). Feedback knock went to -5.37, pulled over because I noticed my DAM dropped to .688 as well. Restarted the car and cleared ECU/Learning. Went to take off and noticed bogging and no turbo response. Almost like Limp Mode, three shifts later in between 1-4 and it went up. However Knock Learn was at -7.14 after turbo returned normal. I don’t WOT very much but this threw me off a lot. Stage 2 currently, just wanna make sure I didn’t spin a bearing, cause a boost leak or any other major issue. My first turbo vehicle so I just wanna check with the community and get feedback.

Marshroom the Neckbeard #1 - Neckbeard tells off the Uncultured Chad for hitting on his Girl So.. welcome to the start of a series about my good friend Marshroom the Neckbeard. Allow me to introduce our characters.


Me - 17, Average teenage male, above average looks, sick of a neckbeard's shit but not enough of a bad-ass to do anything serious.

Marshroom -18, Neckbeard, horrible greasy skin and hair, misogynist since rejection in last post, still talks to me despite how rude he was.

Ali - 15, Girl that's friend with me and that Marshroom is crushing on, pretty sure she's crushing on me.

&amp;#x200B;

So it was a night at our local skating rink once again, since we go once a week it was pretty common for the crowd of people going to change and this week it was Myself, Marshroom the Neckbeard (goes every week) and Ali (Not her real name). Now I'd like to reiterate once more, Ali is underage, by alot to Marshroom. Just to get that into your mind let's continue. I was out on the rink with Ali, since it was her first time skating I was pacing myself to keep at her speed since I remember how my first time skating was. I'm just slowly gliding around the wall of the rink while she clings to the wall and we just talk about dumb teenage stuff. I'm not particularly good friends with Ali, however I can still hold a conversation with her and we were just generally having a good time while Marshroom glides around the rink backwards doing spins and tricks since he's been skating since he was 6. Now I was giving Ali some relationship advice about the types of guys that she shouldn't go after since she's kinda like a little sister and I had nothing else to talk about when Marshroom, the expert relationship holder overhears and skids up beside us and dives into a full lecture about why "females are just after chads like Reverence". Trigger my: Wot. He goes on and on about how lucky I was to be born the way I was and how he's cursed because he's ugly and autistic. I'd like to state that if he just cleaned up he wouldn't be that bad and that he thinks he's autistic, but he uses the excuse that he does. I kind of just focus on skating at this point because I can't stand his misogynistic crap and just zoom around until the night is over and we start packing up. Ali piles into the car with him, and while I live within walking distance I ask for a lift to act as a kind of buffer since he last encounter with a girl was... detrimental to his health to say the least. He drops of Ali and since his radio isn't working we sit in silence until we get to my street where he blurts out "Sorry for interrupting your conversation with Ali, but you've gotten all the hot girls I've been into so far, so lay your hands off this one". I just sit there blinking at him for a moment until I just kind of flip out because I know what he expects from a relationship and what he'll do if she rejects him. He'll expect sex from her and he'll guilt trip her into it, and if she rejects him he'll stalk her. I flip out and just yell at him "She's underage dude, I'm not into her for one and for two you need to back off her because she isn't property, and just because you've had it rough before doesn't mean you deserve to treat her like some rebound object". At this point I get out of the car, slam the door and walk inside. Later I look at Marshroom's Facebook page and notice a bunch of neckbeard/incel/nice guy bs about how women are after asshole chads and how friend you thought were there for you turn out to be assholes. I have skating with him later today, let's see how that goes.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Neckbeard friend tells me of for hitting on underage girl that's like my sister and claims her later. When I tell him off he posts some passive aggressive bs on Facebook.

I nearly got mugged yesterday ( around 3pm) I was walking around holy cross when I came across some hooded thugs,  they where all white males between the ages of 13-20. One of them was freckled and ginger, and the other 2 light brown short hair.

Then it hit me, I knew who these thugs where having seen them in a local paper once, these where the Gabber-hooking hooligans, last I had heard they where still in Shrewsbury (UK) and had knocked over some bins.

They must have been expelled from that country by the Queen herself and have emigrated into our lovely city(the daft cunts). One of them said 'u fukkin wot m8' and pulled out a sharp knife ready to stab me,. At this point I knew I could be killed. I managed to disarm the knife off the ginger one and then tried to whack him with the handle end but the other two got the better of me and pushed me to the ground.

They then surrounded me ready to stomp/stamp the fuck out of me when suddenly a mysterious black man with a massive ginger afro and a glittery suit intercepted them and told them to back off. They scrambled in fear of this man, hopefully back to Shrewsburry on the next freight train and then freight boat.  Thankfully I was unscathed from this attack.

I asked him 'who are you and how did you scare them off like that?

He replied in a suarve African-american accent '\*cleared throat\* For my nameth is tyrone the good and i was sent here to guard you from...'  In the middle of his answer I turned around and walked on home.

The US is are being pushed to choose between Right wing and Left wing Fascism! (Senate testimony today, Kavanaugh)

Are we not? Schumer spouted a bunch of lies, while the Republican, Chuck Grassley, illustrated much of what is going on (albeit with focus on confirming Kavanaugh).

Both had valid points.  The valid point Schumer had was “why Kavanaugh?”...although I think it’s a shame that the democrats and the “media” both did so little to foster healthy debate and examination of Kavanaough’s career history.  Apparently Kavanaugh was a strong supporter of the “US Patriot Act”, which most of us know stripped Americans of more freedom, and gave it to the Federal Government.

It is a red flag that \*this\* is not the reason democrats are objecting to Kavanaough over.

Red flag that Lindsey Graham is suddenly all about MAGA, when \*\*there are photos of him hugging and cohorting with Huma Abedin\*\*.

Red flag that suddenly NBC and a few others are giving so much airtime to Graham smacking down silly liberal antics.

Red flag that many “protestors” have pre-printed signs.

Red flag is Schumer’s speech this morning: so much projection.  \*Democrats were clearly the obfuscators of the process, and included a baseless sexual accusation against Kavanaugh”.

Red flag: Michael Moore tweet last night around 12am. (wish I could post pic, but have 12 hour lock on twitter)

Red flag: Media is totally in bed with dividing the country.  They would benefit from violence (how many Americans will be suddenly watching the news, if violence breaks out.)

Red flag: Schumer, Clinton, Brock, Soros...many others, have explicitly stated their intention to “resist”.  That may be fine, but are they doing it for the right reasons?  Are they being moral/ethical in their pursuit of their goal?  Funding in-organic women’s marches, funding hits in the media, funding BLM protests, dismantling Occupy Wall Street, stealing the election from Bernie, taking tons of money from many middle eastern countries.

Red Flag: MSM complicit with 9/11 coverup and going to war in Iraq, and then Afghanistan.

RF: \[Osama bin Laden interview after 9/11 DENIES INVOLVEMENT\](r/http://serendipity.li/wot/obl_int.htm).

RF: Afghanistan quickly become world’s top Opium exporter.

US BEING PRIMED.

Many believe the media and are whipped into a frenzy.  Many also behind Trump (including Zionists).  If the “Right” does not become more authoritative, the left will seize power!! If the Left does not try to seize power, the Right will. Two snakes are twisted and entangled, fighting over which gets to eat the mice that run about between them.

Approved for a business now city may not approve. My wife ran a large family daycare and had a chance to open a commercial daycare center. Before she signed a 5 year lease she checked with both the city and fire department to make sure she was zoned for a child care center. They both agreed that because it was a commercial property there was no problem.
She signed a lease. She paid an extra fee for a pre-inspection By the fire department. Then spent tens of thousands of dollars to make the property into a proper day care.
After that during the final inspection the fire department said everything was good except now they wanted an $8500 fire alarm put in. (As opposed to the $700 one they originally said)
And that we needed to be re-classified as a zone E (or something) and have an architect/contractor draw up plans of the changes already made.
They approved us for a 90 day pass because of their mistake but wot only 8 kids. (Our property should be able to hold up to 26 kids.)
The contractor we now hired says the city has no clue of how to classify a daycare center (even though there are multiple similar facilities within 8 miles) and they may not approve us. Even though my wife checked and double checked with multiple City agencies.
If they don’t approve us do we have any recourse?
Ask for a exemption? A few waiver? Sue the city for lost time and income?
We don’t want to sue the city. We just want to open but we need to see options.
Any ideas?

Ice and Mixers in a Bourbon Bar (A Savage Journey into the Proper Way to Drink Bourbon) We were somewhere around the Bar on the edge of my stool when the bourbon began to take hold.  "I remember saying something like "I feel a bit tipsy; maybe I shouldn't have another barrel proofer." And suddenly there was this terrible roar all around us and the bar was full of what looked like fedora-wearing neckbeards, all slouching and m'ladying their way up to the bar.  And a voice was screaming, "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?"

My wife had given me $300 in cash, most of which was already spent on pours of extremely rare bourbons.  The top of the bar looked like a flipper's crotch shot.  There was a handle of Weller 12, a bottle of Elmer, the whole range of Pappys, Al Young, all of the 2014 release of BTAC, and a solitary bottle of Heaven Hill 6-year-old Bottled in Bond.  Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious bourbon-collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.  The only thing that really worried me was the Heaven Hill.  There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of a Heaven Hill binge.  And I knew we'd get into that 100-proof stuff pretty soon.

I am still vaguely haunted by the neckbeard’s remark about how he’d “never drank bourbon before.” Here’s this poor geek living in a world of whiskeys leering at him from the tops of bars all the time, and he’s never even tasted one. It made me feel like King Farouk. I was tempted to have my attorney belly up to the bar and arrange some kind of simple, common-law contract whereby we could just give a whole George T. Stagg vertical to this unfortunate bastard. Just say: “Here, sign this and the liquid’s yours.” Give him the bottles and then use the credit card to zap off on a jet to some place like Kentucky and buy another BTAC vertical for a whiskey-addled, top-speed run across the Bourbon Trail all the way out to the last stop in Louisville... and then trade the BTAC off for some Birthday Bourbon. Keep moving.

But our trip was different. It was a classic affirmation of everything right and true and decent in the national character. It was a gross, physical salute to the fantastic *possibilities* of life in this country-but only for those with true grit. And we were chock full of that. This neckbeard?  Not so much.

"Order some Four Roses Single Barrel," I whispered.

Spake the neckbeard, "Good morrow to you!"

Suddenly I found myself wishing for hallucinations of bats and a trunk full of ether and mescaline.

"I prefer the tender embrace of Hudson Baby Bourbon," said the gaping hole beneath the fedora.

"*Precisely* 2 and one quarter fingers," he continued, holding up a mitt that had definitely seen an industrial accident.  Or maybe he'd just held an M80 a second too long as a kid.  That would explain his strange cadence and strained diction.

The TV news was about the Kavanaugh confirmation-a series of horrifying disasters: accusations and twisted wreckage, men fleeing in terror, Federal judges babbling insane lies. "Turn that shit off!" screamed my attorney.  Then to me, "Let's get out of here."

The bartender's eyes were rolling as he followed carefully enunciated instructions to place three perfectly square cubes of ice in the bottom of a Collins glass with a bartender's spoon.  He shed a single tear at the unused Glencairns arrayed behind him.

"Sláinte mhaith!" said the neckbeard, raising his glass of iced-down, overpriced whisk(e)y, so young that there was a corn cob sticking out of it.

"You wot, mate?" I slurred. This is the main advantage of Heaven Hill 6-year BiB: it makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel...total loss of all basic motor skills: Blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue-severance of all connection between the body and the brain. Which is interesting, because the brain continues to function more or less normally...you can actually *watch* yourself behaving in the terrible way, but you can't control it.

And that's when I remembered: this is just Reddit, and you should drink your whiskey however you damn well please.

But, hell, I've got a flask of WT 101, and we'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way out to the end.

And then there's Laurence's third phase after a paniced chaos berserk me smashing his HP bar down to 5% without noticing that he lost his legs as he laid on me.

2004 Suzuki SV650S (Pointy, FI) Idles but revs weirdly and dies Hi y'all,

I bought a 2004 SV650S recently and was going to get it registered. On the way to it's roadworthy the bike died and I had to push it home.


History:
PO bought it new and rode it for 64000kms. She couldn't ride it anymore and sold it to me. The bike didn't see much use, only a weekend ride if that and sat in her garage between rides. It was running in April this year but then was left to sit and had a dead battery.

When I bought it, I brought a new battery and it fired right up. Only when I got home did I see that the tank was rusty as fuck (no pinholes or anything but pretty rusted up). I took it apart and used a kit from one of my local shops to clean and de-rust it but opted not to use the liner (I've heard bad things about them).



Symptoms:

- Ran fine in the morning when I went to the gas station to put petrol in it. I put 95 Octane fuel (Australian Octane rating) and filled it all the way up.
- On the way out I noticed that it was slowly losing power and wouldn't rev past 6k. This problem got worse and worse and eventually I was stuck on the side of the road.
- I stopped and was trying to work out what the problem was. I had to push the bike home
- Bike idles fine in neutral and when clutch is pulled in.
- Both cylinders are hot, so not likely to be spark plug issue
- On steady throttle from idle in neutral, it rises to ~5k rpm and can stay there but then the revs start dropping and it makes a stumbling, burbling sound. It hangs at 3k and stutters there.
- Opened up airbox, filter looks clean. Tried to rev the bike with the filter off and it makes a loud sucking noise but no improvement in revs. Still has hang problem. Likely ruled out air as a problem
- After killing the bike and restarting, in neutral and from idle, I can get to about 7k to 9k rpm by applying wot. With the throttle held open however, the revs start dropping and stumbling down to 5k then down to 2k. This was consistent.
- The bike had no power and I couldn't even get it to ride on it's own power for more than 30 seconds max. I had to kill the bike, restart it and rev the bike hard from wot and clutch out a little to get it started rolling. After about 30 seconds the revs drop and the engine dies. THis problem got worse and worse until eventually I couldn't get it to rev past 2k.
- There are no warning lights on the dash.
- Fuel line is connected fine. Breather hoses suck air when idling, don't appear to be blocked.
- Rear cylinder spark plug pulled, seems to be fine, if a little black.
- Exhaust doesn't smell like unburnt fuel. Maybe a little funky, but I'm not sure if that's placebo. I drained out all the old fuel and put in relatively fresh fuel when I de-rusted the tank.


Likely Issues:

- I believe fuel pump is the most likely culprit. The pump looks pretty filthy so I will be cleaning it out later today. I am just hesitant to spend $800 on a fuel pump assembly if it's not the culprit.
- Battery might be another thing? I disconnected the heated hand grips from the battery but no improvement in the revs. I'm putting it on charge now.
- I don't think it'll be the spark plug issue since both cylinders are hot.


I just want some opinions from people in the know. Worst comes to worst, I'll just part out the bike. I would like to ride the bike as I've heard great things about the SVs but maybe this one is just too much of a basket case.

Today I spent 11 hours cleaning today so that my fiance would agree to read WoT My fiance and I have been in the process of moving in together for a few weeks and because of the amount of stuff being moved the house was a disaster. And I admit Im not the cleanest person, I've always cleaned from necessity like when i've needed something, where my fiance was getting stressed by all the clutter. So after a talk last night I agreed to be more active in decluttering, and then I made her an offer: If I got the house 100% clean today she would agree to read WoT. She kind of laughed it off mainly because she didnt think I could do it and agreed. I got started at 8am and worked on it till a little after 7pm calling in a favor from a freind with a truck to help me dump a futon and a piece of a sectional.

 When my fiance got home from work to a spotless house the only thing left out was my copy of "The Eye of the World" with a note on it saying
"Thus is our treaty written; thus is agreement made. Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades. What was asked is given; the price is paid."

What would be the evil thing running this shrine? so basically, players where travelling to a city, and came across a small village (those of you who have read WoT might recognise part of this). after entering, everyone made it clear to the party that they were allowed to come and buy stuff, but should get away from the village before nightfall. they didn't... a red mist burst outwards from the evil looking fountain in the center of town, and when it reached everyone, it made them go into a rage and attack anything near them, and anyone who dies in the village at night is trapped there forever and comes back to life each morning with no memory of the event, but some people know about by finding blood under their nails etc. party saved against its affects, and went into the center of town to see what the hell was going on. all the water in the fountain had turned into blood, and touching it basically caused an action surge to attack anything near you. the ranger spotted a hidden entrance in the fountain, and managed to open it. bard saw that some symbols on the fountain looked like symbols of baphomet, who is basically the god of rage and war etc (evil one though, he's pretty much khorne). my plan is for a cult of baphomet to be under the fountain, causing this curse, but i don't know what big thing would be leading it/what the cult could be summoning. party is level 5.

How to deal with being speared at a toll booth......  Hi all, How could I have handled this better, or is there no other way? I had 1 hour to go for a 30,000+ paying load to be delivered. I entered a Tollbooth, paid my money, the barrier lifted and I went to drive through. About halfway through the truck stalled and I tried again, then I saw the toll red and white poll had cut through my trailer and I was stuck. I tried reversing and high revving and forcing myself free but to no avail. So I called for assistance and was transported to the nearest city. But my trailer was gone and the gps did not show my route anymore so I could not finish the job and lost my 30,000+. This was a WOT delivery.

 Is this how this type of incident plays out or is there some way I could have called for assistance and paid my fine but still deliver the load?

Would the same have happened if this had of been a freight market job?

Anyway good experience......

HELP! Limited power, no boost, P0113 and P0300 error codes after changing from K&amp;N to stock paper air filter. I would really appreciate input from the community before contacting my Ford dealer for a warranty claim. My 10mo old 2017 ST with 15k miles is not drive-able after I replaced my K&amp;N filter with the stock paper filter in order to clean the K&amp;N. Currently, the engine does not rev above 3000RPM (in neutral or in gear while moving) and I'm unable to drive above 30mph.

I've checked and rechecked all boost hose connections between turbo and throttle body. Still no boost per boost gauge or in the Torque app. No audible leak heard.  When I tried to drive it, the Torque app shows the engine running AFR at 10-12 instead of 14.7. It seems to respond best to small throttle inputs instead of WOT.

If the problem had arose after I replaced the cleaned and re-oiled K&amp;N I would guess I over-applied oil and fouled the IAT sensor... but the problem occurred after removing the K&amp;N (used for nearly the entire life of the car) and reusing the stock paper filter.

I tried resetting the KAM (disconnecting negative terminal for 20min+).

I'm open to any suggestions and will update this section as I try each potential solution.

Thanks

1993 Honda Accord EX - Bucking issue manual transmission Hey there. So I'm having an issue with the acceleration causing a bucking motion (front to back) in the car, that neither myself or my mechanic has been able to resolve as of yet. Here are a list of conditions that would help someone who knows more than me about whats going on:
\- Does not happen in 5th or 4th gear
\- Most pronounced while getting into 2nd gear
\-More pronounced once car is at operating temperature - barely noticeable during first few minutes of driving
\- Air intake has been thoroughly inspected. There was a crack in both the tube and one of the vacuum lines. The issue persisted after fixing.
\- Most pronounced when cruising through a neighborhood at 15-25mph while barely holding the throttle open in 2nd. Its actually quite ridiculous how much more it happens under this condition.
\- Once I'm in the power band, WOT is completely smooth
\- The head block is 2 years old and the valve cover gasket was recently replaced due to leaking


I don't think its a timing issue, because the engine otherwise runs very smooth for a 93 with 190k miles. Not sure its a fuel issue, as I have no other effects that would suggest something wrong with the fuel system. It was running rich at one point until i replaced the PCV valve. Now I'm getting 25 average MPG which i think is fairly normal for the car considering its age and the fact that it is lowered which would cause more downforce drag. Again, the most puzzling and maybe telling thing for me is that it gets much worse once the car is warmed up.

Drove an R34 GTR in Japanese Touge Just finished a Japan leg of a vacation - one of the highlights was in Hakone, doing a guided driving tour with rentals around Hakone and Lake Ashi. The rental company, Fun2Drive is great! Have a pretty large selection of mostly JDM cars, with a few other cars (964 Turbo in Blackbird Wangan Midnight guise,  Gallardo, etc.). A lot are based on Initial D, including a wide body RX7, tofu shop AE86, R32, etc.

http://imgur.com/t6mVvKx
http://imgur.com/W92yNk7

I choose the longest guided tour, the ultimate Hakone tour. This was essentially a 6 hour tour (~4 hours of driving) around multiple touge passes in Hakone. There was quite a bit of elevation change, with the peak around 1KM, going all the way down to sea level at Lake Ashi. A lot of the roads were quite narrow, and there was some traffic on the more main roads, including oncoming buses and traffic.

With that said, the driving was fantastic. It did take a while for me as an American to get used to driving on the left side of the road. Shifting with my left hand was fine, but difficult to get rev matching correct given I didnt have the muscle memory of shifting with my right hand. We mostly took two lane roads, so navigation wasn't too difficult following the guide. Hardest bit is to make sure the car is centered in the lane / making room for wide oncoming traffic - you'll get used to it, but never quite as comfortable as driving on the right hand. Glancing at the mirrors is also reversed as well, although wasn't a huge issue.

There were some slower bits, but there were also times where the guides let loose a bit and you were able to really corner carve. Our group was pretty quick so got some good sections in. The lead guide would also call out oncoming traffic and obstacles which helped as far as when to slow down

Now to the GTR - it was a great car to drive, but honestly wasn't quite as magical as my expectations played it out to be. Dont get me wrong, the car handles fantastic for something almost 20 years old. Steering is very direct, and the car grips like crazy for being on performance all season tires. Not quite on the level of my R8, but I can understand how when this came out it was astonishing. Mine was a totally stock example, so power was generally good overall. About on par with my old SS 2014 Camaro. Power builds differently though. The turbo kicks in around 4k and pulls the strongest to about 6.5k. The one thing I wish was for the car to be louder. With the stock exhaust, it's really quiet - doesn't sound much like the numerous YouTube videos of the R34. The turbo may actually be the most notable sound. I think it did contribute to the car feeling a bit clinical however. One of the other guys on the drive rented the 964 Turbo, which looked like an insane ride - tons of backfire and would noticeably squat to the rear under WOT

Overall it was a great experience, one I'd definitely recommend. The guides were really helpful and great guides. They would point out famous sections from initial D along the way

Do the valve adjustment. Just do it. As the title states, if your Fit hasn't had it done and is stuttering or getting poor gas mpg, or seems to take WOT at all times just to get it moving...then you need to do the adjustment.

I put it off and put it off just trying to kick the can down the road. I wish I had it done right when I bought the car at 190k mi, now at 230k mi it's night and day.

The PO had it in the family since purchase, and from what he told me it had NEVER been done. They had run full synthetic since new, so I think they may have made it possible to get SO many miles without doing the adjustment.

So much of the car is still original, it kind of blows my mind how solid these little things are. Pretty sure it's still on the original clutch, though that feels pretty bad at this point. I especially think the light weight factors into less overall wear compared to other cars.

I'm rambling, but I'd be happy to answer any questions about my high mile Fit. 230k mi (2007).

I believe I found a synthetic cannabinoid in a labeled "CBD" product. A rather powerful trip was induced. CAUTION with Hemptrance products!!! WoT TLDR Says I need 10 comment karma to post in the CBD sub so I'm gonna post here because what I had was certainly DRUGS. Im on a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I feel obligated to let others know what dangerous stuff is out there. Can you guys help me out get to 10??? Or someone else can crosspost. I don't care. It needs to be shared.


So it goes...
not all CBD is created equal. learned the hell out of that today.

gotta call this a mild trip what happened to me.

***************
TLDR: I ate 3 hemptrance gummies with a heavy meal, allegedly "150mg of full spectrum nano CBD", and a trip formed that can only be described as feeling similar to synthetic cannabinoids which I have tried orally countless times.

Paranoia and anxiety were experienced. I admit some of the experience was enjoyable, but people should know what they're taking before they take it!

CAUTION ADVISED! Please stay away from this product and spread the word.

What follows is my trip report and feelings on the intentional drugging of people without their knowledge.

Thoughts are clearly scattered. I was high without knowing I was going to be. So take each bit with a grain of salt but all of it is as true as can be.
***************


holy shit. this stuff is strong.

60 minutes after dosing.

louder internal volume.
mind seems optimistic. looking forward to things. my conscious of what I will eat later

won't deny there's some background anxiety present, probably at the thought of being unknowingly drugged, but saying this helps me better enjoy it I suppose. if I wasn't familiar with other drugs I'd be much more anxious.

racing thoughts. I suppose this is synth cannabinoid. I have wide experience with them (JWH018, 081, 122, 250, etc, CP55 and 47, AKB-48, UR-144, the list goes on) been several years though, but it's somewhat reminiscent of what some of the oral ones were like.

fat consumption seems to alter effects of this drug. 3 on an empty stomach didn't produce such profound effects... or they were greatly delayed until the food I ate pushed it to digest. could be wrong. hard to guestimate with synthetics. the lack of any visual distortion indicates there's a high probability this is not a type of non-cannabinoid hallucinogen. nor is it opiate like as if it were fentanyl.

when I tried it last, I was like "oh boy, no don't do that again" . but I tried it again, thinking maybe I was experiencing some type of placebo effect. 3 chewed up really well with a high fat meal lended to incredibly strong effects, that I don't find the most enjoyable (more because im surprised by having any effect at all and I have to go to work later).

maybe this could be the trip I need to straighten life out? ... the unintentional trip. There's some enjoyment here, but what I really want my point to be is that this stuff is DANGEROUS, especially to the novice user. I can't imagine eating these if I had never had something like THC/other synthetics before. I might have started bugging out from the powerful shift in mental thought processes.

I also can't imagine eating a whole bag of these! 3 has lit me like a Christmas tree. hopefully this trash is pulled from the shelves. dealing drugs this way is NOT OKAY. you could be killing people, or getting them in trouble, and lending a bad name to the CBD industry which I happen to greatly enjoy. the only psychoactive effect I get a from CBD is mild relaxation, so mild it's nearly imperceptible unless you're looking for it and are familiar with the effects of other drugs. and no matter how high the dose is, the relaxation is relatively constant.

there was a 30-45 minute "come up" period that was unconfortable. after this plateaus over the next 30 minutes, the high is exposed

sneaky sneaky you are hemptrance. seems like that other company at work here friends. I believe it was diamond, who then must have simply changed names and perhaps started selling legitimate product from their main site after transitioning. who knows.

super not a fan of the paranoid effects lol. really reawakens some strange feelings from bad synthetic trips I had in the past. but at least I knew what I was taking! I did it to myself willingly. this drugging of people without any knowledge (some probably have knowledge) needs to stop.

I should have known something was amiss when I was looking at the CBD oils in a smoke shop and the vendor looks to me and says "oh we just got these" and hands me this hemptrance stuff. yeah. I see. 350mg for 25 in my expensive city??? that is incredibly low.

if something seems too good to be true it probably is. remember that folks.

and if you read this ...

if you try to tell me I'm feeling .3% of THC from 150mg of "full spectrum nano CBD", I gotta call bull shit. if it was just thc it would still be less than a milligram, and never absorb nearly as fast. I'm way too familiar with the effects of countless drugs, such as thc, having tried so many throughout my "trial experimentations"

although I gave up psychoactive drugs a while back, CBD was so helpful for me. digestive improvement, exercise enhancement, anti-inflammatory, and as a mild analgesic. I haven't felt any exercise injuries where I used to experience them frequently. a natural wonder drug.

this hemptrance shit is a powerful intoxicant and potentially lethal at the right dose. caution greatly advised. maybe Reddit can get action to be taken against these people.

I am surprised there aren't more posts about it. if you're gonna deal drugs to stores, don't put it in a product where people are expecting "no psychoactivity (CBD)" and instead just label your shit k2/spice and call it a day.

it's now 90 mins since consumption. I wrote that all out because I believe it's necessary to spread information about the safe use of drugs and this certainly counts.

most of the anxiety has ebbed. my eyes feel like they're about to turn red from the dry-eyed feeling that usually accompanies cannabis as well as synthetics. it would be enjoyable if I desired the high, that's for sure.  music sounds amazing, senses feel enhanced, some appetite stimulation but I've been eating very well lately so I can easily resist overeating. otherwise I would have probably eaten cartons of cookies if this was years ago.


I know some of this is repetitious, and the grammar/spelling is off in certain places, but please remember that I was high and felt extreme dedication to writing this all as quickly as possible as a trip report to warn others before I got to work today.

there are some of you who will undoubtedly read this and purchase the product. please dont. but if you do, know that having these can cause you extremely unpleasant side effects. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU UP THE DOSE TO MULTIPLE GUMMIES

let the ARTIST and SONG title spell out what you should do with this particular chemical
DESIGNER DRUGS - SPIT IT OUT.

the song is pretty good too if you like this type of music.

110 minutes
rethinking life choices. in some way this is a therapeutic trip.

the only thing I can think of slightly skewing this report would be the 80mg of caffeine i had 6 hours ago, or the two capsules of whole foods triple ginseng. but I've taken both of those supplements countless times, and in higher doses, and NEVER experienced anything like this.

it bothers me now that I find im enjoying it more as the effects are ebbing. if someone has access to funding to get these completely lab tested I am extremely curious about the results.

I believe i consumed synthetic cannabinoids disguised as "CBD" from Hemptrance. Anxiety and paranoia was experienced and caution is Greatly Advised! WoT TLDR
not all CBD is created equal. learned the hell out of that today.

gotta call this a mild trip what happened to me.

***************
TLDR: I ate 3 hemptrance gummies with a heavy meal, allegedly "150mg of full spectrum nano CBD", and a trip formed that can only be described as feeling similar to synthetic cannabinoids which I have tried countless times.

Paranoia and anxiety were experienced. I admit some of the experience was enjoyable, but people should know what they're taking before they take it!

CAUTION ADVISED! Please stay away from this product and spread the word.

What follows is my trip report and feelings on the intentional drugging of people without their knowledge.

Thoughts are clearly scattered. I was high without knowing I was going to be.
***************


holy shit. this stuff is strong.

louder internal volume.
mind seems optimistic. looking forward to things. my conscious of what I will eat later

won't deny there's some background anxiety present, probably at the thought of being unknowingly drugged, but saying this helps me better enjoy it I suppose. if I wasn't familiar with other drugs I'd be much more anxious.

racing thoughts. I suppose this is synth cannabinoid. I have wide experience with them (JWH018, 081, 122, 250, etc, CP55 and 47, AKB-48, UR-144, the list goes on) been several years though, but it's somewhat reminiscent of what some of the oral ones were like.

fat consumption seems to alter effects of this drug. 3 on an empty stomach didn't produce such profound effects... or they were greatly delayed until the food I ate pushed it to digest. could be wrong. hard to guestimate with synthetics. the lack of any visual distortion indicates there's a high probability this is not a type of non-cannabinoid hallucinogen. nor is it opiate like as if it were fentanyl.

when I tried it last, I was like "oh boy, no don't do that again" . but I tried it again, thinking maybe I was experiencing some type of placebo effect. 3 chewed up really well with a high fat meal lended to incredibly strong effects, that I don't find the most enjoyable (more because im surprised by having any effect at all and I have to go to work later).

maybe this could be the trip I need to straighten life out? ... the unintentional trip. There's some enjoyment here, but what I really want my point to be is that this stuff is DANGEROUS, especially to the novice user. I can't imagine eating these if I had never had something like THC/other synthetics before. I might have started bugging out from the powerful shift in mental thought processes.

I also can't imagine eating a whole bag of these! 3 has lit me like a Christmas tree. hopefully this trash is pulled from the shelves. dealing drugs this way is NOT OKAY. you could be killing people, or getting them in trouble, and lending a bad name to the CBD industry which I happen to greatly enjoy. the only psychoactive effect I get a from CBD is mild relaxation, so mild it's nearly imperceptible unless you're looking for it and are familiar with the effects of other drugs. and no matter how high the dose is, the relaxation is relatively constant.

i share my body with someone else So... long story short, I feel like my body isn’t my own...

12.10.2058
I’ve always been like this. I’ve always found it hard to fit in at school. I always get bullied for not being the same as them.

I was born with something doctors call, ‘abnormalitation syndrome’. It’s pretty much where I am born looking like a complete alien. I have crimson eyes that supposedly glow in the dark and hair that grows at a normal, human pace but can change colour. It can go from brown to blonde or blonde to ginger. It changes naturally about once a month and teachers sometimes think I just keep on dying it.... how I love to prove them wrong. I also have bright pink cheeks as though I do cross country for 6 hours everyday and my eyelashes are satisfyingly long that I’m sure people sometimes get jealous. I’m also extremely short, around 4’1 bearing in mind I’m 12.

To someone reading this, your probably thinking that it doesn’t sound that bad but... I also have scars on my limbs from the countless surgeries I have had.
You may be wondering... why did you need surgery? I was born with excessive amounts of skin that just hung underneath my arms and legs, like an elderly person who had lots of loose skin, but, I had more skin, that’s why I actually needed surgery.


12.10.2059
I’ve started get therapy for my depression and anxiety but I honestly don’t think it’s working. I’m not sure if it’s normal teenage hormones causing me to go through this mental pain or if it’s something else. I feel like there’s something in my head. My head feels heavy... and I feel as though I’m just not here.


12.10.2060
I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, severe anxiety, bipolar disorder, depersonalisation disorder and PTSD. You may be asking, ‘How did you get PTSD?’ Well... I witnessed my best friend being brutally killed. Murdered. I feel like the murderer was right next me. And... I’m not sure if... if... it was me. But I don’t recall doing anything like it, or even wanting to do anything like it. I feel like... there’s two people sharing my body.


12.10.2062
I don’t even know what’s going on anymore. I  think I keep on hearing voices in my head, but... no, I can hear voices in my head. It’s so clear, and loud. Of course no one believes me though. The voice tells me strange things that cannot be true. It tells me it’s a nice voice that’s just trying to help me, but from all the fiction films I’ve watched, they never work out that way.


12.10.2070
hi their! i am so sry that its bean so long sinse ive sed anything but ive been with mi family and frends. i almost forgot that i had this diary and that i coold record any inportant stuf that i kneeded to. so wear shoold i start. yesterday we all went on a trip to the forest where we all climed up a tree to see hoo coold reech the top ferst then jump of. everywon was to scaird so we didnt do that but then we all went in a lake to see woo coold stay underwata the longest. my nan won. she didnt com bak up though.

12.10.2075
My mum has forced me into a mental asylum. It’s not fun, but I just want to get better. I want this to stop.


12.10.2076
Slowly but surely, I’m getting there. I think I’m truly getting better. I feel like my body is mine. My head isn’t as heavy as it used to be. I’ve been on strong medication for the past year. Sometimes I guess I was a bit tough to work with but in the end I’m grateful that no one gave up on me and I’m actually almost there.


12.10.2079
I’m going home tomorrow. Yay! :)


12.10.2089
It’s been 10 years since I’ve last said anything. i hav bean havin lots of fun. I still sometimes feel a little strange, but tats wot its like to hav Abnormalitation Syndrome. I’m still trying to get used to being myself and having my body feel like it’s actually mine.

Major stuttering when freeway cruising need help with 04 WR450F Jetting So I just picked up an 04 WR450F Supermoto. I just did a full cleanup on the carb. All new AC pump, and new jets all around.

For mods I have done, grey wire, YZ throttle stop fix, O ring, Stock exhaust uncorked, Air box opened on side, and snorkel removed. The bike also came with a K&amp;N air filter in it, I just cleaned it thoroughly and lightly oiled it.

The bike Idles great, the AC pump is working great, I can flick the throttle off idle and it rips hard no bogs. Cruising around slowly is fine, and WOT is fine too. Where I am having major issues though is when I try to maintain any speed more than 60 MPH the bike starts stuttering really badly!

Environment: Sea Level and 65F

For carb set up I have 165 MJ, 48 PJ, 60 leak jet, Stock needle. (position details below). All new jets and everything blasted thoroughly with cleaner.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I have tried so far:

Step 1) I started with the 3rd position on the needle (from the top of the needle). As soon as I hit 65 MPH the bikes stutters bad, impossible even to maintain any speed greater than 65, unless I go to WOT. WOT the bike will rip right up to 95MPH as expected. From 95 if I let off the throttle completely the bike decelerates as expected no major popping or back firing. But from WOT &amp; 95MPH if I let off the throttle to 75% throttle open it starts in again with the stuttering immediately even as it's decelerating still.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2) On this attempt, I made the wrong move and the problem got way worse. I moved the clip to the 5th position on the needle. On the test ride the hesitations would start in hard at 45 MPH. The bike was nearly unridable, I didn't even leave my neighborhood.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3) This attempt I went with the 1st position on the needle. This fixed a lot of the problem, but things still aren't 100%. The bike is now able to actually ride and maintain speeds above 65, it will hold 70 fine, or 80 fine, or 90 fine. But I do still feel the hesitations while cruising above 65 a little bit, and WOT doesn't have the same punch as it did on the 3rd clip.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do y'all think. I am thrown off because everyone online seems to think that 165 MJ should be prefect for my setup and atmosphere conditions, but then they are ALL running JD needles on 3rd or 4th clip, where I just have the stock needle. At least I think it's stock, it has no markings on it at all. Also no one runs the K&amp;N air filter either. I plan on replacing the Air filter with a foam one ASAP. Perhaps the air filter is causing the issue?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 160 MJ in stock too. I think next I might try the 160, and the 2nd needle position.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I will try replacing the air filter to see if that changes anything too.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the obvious answer is to buy a JD needle. But that's 90 bucks that I don't have to spend. Does anyone happen to have a JD Blue needle laying around for the WR450F they could sell to me for cheap?

Focus RS vs 2018 Mustang GT: Dilemma and a little Review I'm having an issue here. I just got a 2018 Mustang GT, and I love it. I came from a GT350 that Ford had bought back from me due to issues, and got myself into the 2018 GT 10 Speed Auto because I've seen how capable it has been stock motor/trans in taking boost and running upwards of 700-1000+whp. My friends and I are mustang guys (no crowd hunters though) and we are all excited for when I decide on what brand supercharger to get, as I think I could blow the doors off just about anything around where I live.

However, for some odd reason I keep coming back to the Focus RS. I want one, badly, but it doesn't make sense to have a Mustang GT, Mustang Ecoboost (my wife's), Focus RS, and my Ford Explorer (used to haul around my big dogs.) I live in Southern California, so weather isn't really an issue, but I love canyons, but my mustang handles really well for a heavy RWD car.

I've come up with some pros, cons of each, as I've driven each one quite a bit, so I'd figure I'd give you guys a bit of a review of it in the mind of a car enthusiast who wants to go fast and have fun with their daily driver.

**2018 Mustang GT 10r80 Performance Pack** \- I love this car, its loud, fast and because this is my 3rd mustang I am very comfortable with it. It is scary fast sometimes even though it is bone stock, I think a lot of the credit goes towards the 10 speed automatic transmission. I've gathered all the parts that I'd want aside from supercharger that are sitting in my garage just waiting to be put on the car. It handles relatively well, but is just really a great cruiser and I can make it a highway/drag strip/roll racing king with probably less than 10k.

**PROS**: Power is easy/cheap to get through supercharging/turbo, and seems to be relatively reliable.

10 Speed auto is actually really great, extremely responsive on WOT

Interior is relatively nice, I've been thinking about upgrading to the digital cluster. Already did the tesla screen which looks and functions well for my basic needs.

Parts/support/community seem to be endless.

One of the best cars to go really really fast in. (opinion)

V8 Coyote sound

**CONS**: Cop magnet

I floor it for more than 4 seconds and I'm breaking the law.

Its a mustang and it gets a lot of hate sometimes.

Everyone has one.

Can't fit my big dog in it.

**2017 Focus RS -** This is a great little car. It is super easy to drive, and corners exceptionally well (as it should), and has a lot of quirks and features (i.e. launch control/hatchback usability) that are great as a daily driver and a fun car all in one. It is fast, however after about 60mph it kind of falls on its face, versus the GT is just getting started at that point. But still, It sounds awesome in its own special way, and is probably the coolest car as far as uniqueness that I have ever driven. However at the end of the day, it is a Focus, whether you take that as a pro or a con is up to you. I haven't made up my mind yet.

**PROS**: Exhaust note is awesome, pops crackles and bangs are really cool.

Launch Control.

Can be fun without going to jail.

Easiest manual I have ever driven, outside of GM/BMW/Porsche auto rev matching stuff.

No one really has one.

AWD 4 door hatchback turbo.

Fits my dogs.

Very confidence inspiring car, handles beautifully for my relatively mediocre canyon/track skills.

Blends in well when it comes to law enforcement.

They're ending the Focus RS production so it will be rare forever in comparison to the GT.

**CONS**: Slower than the GT, by a good margin.

Seem to be a little less reliable.

Parts seem to be less available.

Making huge power is more expensive.

It's kind of boring to look at compared to a 2 door coupe. (opinion)

My grandma drives a Focus.

Kind of cramped interior wise for a 4 door hatchback.

The interior is still a Focus.

It's a 40 thousand dollar Focus.

**TL:DR**: My question to you all is whether or not I should keep the 2018 Mustang GT 10r80, boost it, enjoy it. OR trade it for a similar mileage Focus RS, throw bolt-ons on it and be done? Any other thoughts or questions are always welcome.

Important Note: I've been through a 2016 Mustang GT, 2016 Shelby GT350, 2016 C7 Corvette, and now this 2018 Mustang GT, in the past year. So my wife says NO MORE CARS. So at this point, once I make my decision it is a done deal and I have to chill out for at least a couple years. I have a friend who may be open to trading his similar mileage 2017 Focus RS for my 2018 GT, so this is it. Decisions decisions...

Thanks for reading!

Anyone feel like rev hang is even worse/more annoying when shifting at 5k+? I typically don't even rev this far due to the power drop off, feels faster to send it from 3.5k-4.5 and shift. But when I do take it closer to redline, I REALLY notice bad rev hang. Like I'm telling the car "GO FAST NOW!" and I clutch in at 5.5k and it's like "Oh, let me just sit here until you've slowed down 10mph" until the revs are in the correct range for the next gear.

Rev hang can be pretty bad driving around town on 1-2 shifts, but when you're really pushing it hard past 5k the rev hang is just a slap in the face. It's like the car says either fuck your clutch or fuck your 0-60. Having to wait 1-2 seconds after clutch-in while WOT approaching redline in 3rd before revs drop is just insanity to me.

After my recent experience, I'd avoid pixel phones if you don't live near ibreakufixit or Puls I LOVE my pixel 2 XL so it pains me to say this, but I recommend checking if you can get your device fixed near you if you have problems before buying a pixel.  The closest ibreakufixit from me is 2 hours away and Puls doesn't serve my city either.

Because of this, I sent in my phone to Google's new repair service (Im not taking about their warranty repairs or replacement department, which I've actually had good experiences with), and the experience is totally unacceptable experience.   I won't bore everyone with the details, but I sent my phone in to get a cracked screen fixed which they said would be $200 and they emailed me back saying my phone has a network problem and it will cost $400.  I then spent over 4 hours on the phone with them over multiple days and no one could tell me what was actually wrong with my phone, just that it has a network problem, which they say means it either doesn't connect to the network, wifi, Bluetooth, or NFC.  I told them those all worked fine when i sent it in and asked if my phone is now broken and wot work.  Well they couldn't tell me whether my phone works anymore and I either need to pay the extra 200 or get my phone back unrepaired.  That's completely unacceptable.  Imagine you sent your car in for service with a cracked windshield and they called you to say something under the hood doesn't work and it will be double the quoted price.  And they refused to tell you what was wrong with your car?  That's what they are doing with my phone.

As it stands I'm so frustrated with my experience that I will no longer be upgrading from the 2 XL to a pixel 3 XL and won't be suggesting others do that are in the same situation I am and dont have an official repair facility nearby.  I'm the tech guy in my family and friends, and Google is losing a lot of sales because of this.  I personally convinced a dozen people to get a pixel 2 or 2 XL.  I will be doing the opposite for the pixel 3.  I'll suggest anyone who doesn't live near a repair facility avoid them like the plague.  At least until they get their repair service operating well.

[CA, SAN FRANCISCO] denied visitation for weeks now Summary: mother has been consistently against coparenting since LS five years ago, based on false allegations of abuse (I. Have. Never. Been Arrested. For Anything.)  Since LS Daughter has increased her distance from me.  MSA granted me every weekend visitations and Wednesday dinners.  Daughter is now 13 and exhibiting signs of a chemical fascination, to the point where I had to have a talk with her about talking loudly about drugs when we were in public situations.  Daughter "disappeared" during Labor Day weekend (no known location and unreachable), and again during our last visitation, despite having a long and mature talk about why I needed to know where she was after the first incident (long history of mental health &amp; self-harming incidents).   Now Mother is protecting daughter and blaming me, saying I'm "unstable" and "do not provide a safe environment" which have no basis in reality and fly in the face of me just trying to establish safe boundaries.  Totally willing to submit to drug/alcohol screenings, which Mother and Daughter will probably have a tough time with while meanwhile I'm clean as a whistle.  Police will not help me.  Have not seen Daughter in many weeks despite court orders.  Wot do?

 I sexually Identify as an the sun. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of slamming hydrogen isotopes into each other to make helium &amp; light and send it throught the galaxy. People say to me that a person being a star is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon inflate me with hydrogen and raise my temperature to over 6000 °C. From now on I want you guys to call me “Sol” and respect my right to give you vitamin D and probably sunburns. If you can’t accept me you’re a fusionphobe and need to check your astral privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.

Hello. I am a 15 year old Rhinoceros. The only problem is that my horn on my head is soft and limp. As you may know this is very devastating to a rhino like myself. If there are any rhinos out there that can help me with my problem it would be appreciated. Please dont copy paste this. This is my story.

Disney gives Rian Johnston a trilogy after creating perhaps the worst Star Wars movie to date, and insulting fans. I wonder what else they'd let him do if he simply asked?


Rian Johnston re-directs: The Dark Knight


**Bank Scene**
Joker and his goons begin to rob the bank, gunning down security, threatening hostages and the Tellers.


Teller: "I'm sorry sir, but we cant give you any money unless you open an account."
\*Cue 5 minutes of Joker and one goon hilariously fumbling around and answering questions to open their own account before continuing to rob the place.\*


\*They are cut off as the Bank Manager pulls out his shotgun and guns down every one of the bank robbers, excluding the joker, however 15 more Joker goons come out of nowhere and gun him down, bank robbery proceeds as normal.\*
(Footnote: No one comment on how unnecessary or forced the humour is in this scene, or how it doesn't matter how much the bad-guys fail, they always come back with more resources, else you're a manbaby.)


**Parking Lot Scene**


Chechen: "My dogs are hungry!"

\*Batman Impostor Silhouette is visible, the Impostor lifts an assault rifle and begins to gun down several mobsters, chaos and a large gunfight ensues, the real batman does not show up.\*


\*Cut to Wayne Manor, entirely undamaged from the last movie, Bruce sat in an armchair, watching a live news-feed of the gunfight on the evening news, sipping whiskey. Alfred walks in, confused why he wont intervene.\*


Alfred (Offensively Cockney): "Mashta Wayne, shudn' you be 'aught' there? Fightin' the baddies?"
Bruce: "What, you think I'm just gonna drive my tank-car in there, pull out my bat-shaped knives and take on the whole criminal Empire of Gotham?"
Alfred: "Well you's certainly subverted ma 'exhpectations', ol' chum!"
(Footnote: No one comment on how this seems very flimsy as that is exactly what he does in every other piece of media he is in, else you're a manbaby)







**Mob Meeting Scene**


Gambol:  \[To Joker\] "Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy here pull your head off."

Joker: "How about a magic trick? I'm goi-"


\*Joker is cut off as Gambol shoots the Joker, killing him instantly.\*


Maroni &amp; Chechen: (Simultaneously) "Well that certainly subverted our expectations."
(Footnote: No one comment on how this kills of a potentially strong villain suddenly/too early, else you're a manbaby.)




&amp;#x200B;

**Batman kidnapping Lau Scene**


\*Rachel is in Batmans place in the Batsuit, Bruce still refuses to leave his home because he is sad.\*
\*Rachel proceeds to hurl straight into the building, faster, more silently and more efficiently than Batman did, and escapes without the Fulton Extraction balloon.\*
(Footnote: No one comment on how this makes no sense because Rachel has no training in the suit yet manages to do something yet unseen with it, and with more efficiency than with someone proficient in it, else you're a manbaby.)




&amp;#x200B;

**Joker attacks Bruce's Fundraiser**


\*Gambol appears instead of Joker, searching for Harvey Dent\*


\*Very little dialogue is spoken before Bruce Wayne as Batman appears with an assault rifle, and begins gunning down the small mob of invaders, Gambol escapes.\*
\*Show scene of Batman double tapping the downed invaders to reinforce that this is my Batman\*
(Footnote: No one comment on how this betrays Batman's Inherent ideology of non-lethality else you're a manbaby)







**Town centre funeral**


\*Funeral proceeds as normal, Gambol is disguised as a member of the GCPD Funeral Procession, he turns to fire a shot at the Mayor, upon the Podium.\*


\*Jim Gordon leaps up to try and tackle the Mayor out of the way, however another police officer tackles Jim Gordon the other direction.\*


Unknown Officer: "Jim, we'll never beat them by killing what we hate, but saving what we love."


\*In the background, out of focus, the Mayor is seen getting a quarter of his entire body-mass literally ripped from his body under a hail of gunfire\*






**Police Escort Chase**


\*Majority of firefight has occured, Gambol is firing rockets at Harvey Dent's SWAT Van.\*


\*Bruce Wayne, now redeemed as Batman approaches, preparing boosters to leap in-front of the rocket.\*


\*Boosters engage, however the Batmobile is side-swiped by another Tumbler, wrecking both cars, Batman crawls out and over to the driver of the other Tumbler, revealing an injured Alfred.\*


Alfred: "Mashta Bruce, we'll neva' beat them by killin' what we 'ate! Baht saving wot we love!"


\*In the background out of focus, we see Harvey's SWAT Van explode, and a burning Harvey running out from it, screaming, his entire left side engulfed in flames, in the foreground Alfred kisses Bruce.\*




What do you think?
Any more scene's he'd change, or reckon he could do a better job on any other critically acclaimed movies/franchises?

In need of insight to my situation. Is this a normal thing to grow up dealing with? (please, anyone) I am 24 yrs old, male, always lived at home, unemployed at the moment and have been for 5 months (working on it) and never had a stable enough job that pays enough for me to move out long-term.

Ok so I live with my dad who works full time and my mom who has not worked in 9yrs (she stopped working to look after her parent who passed away which is understandable). But throughout my entire life she has been a drinker. I'm talking at least 2 nights a week but usually 4 nights a week she will have just that few too many glasses of wine and me and my dad get it.

She turns into a different person, a victim. Nothing is good and everything is bad and she creates problems out of thin air. Me and my dad have spoken to her in day hours (while she is sober) and said how we aren't into it because it is causing arguments and that we would like to see her go back to work to get a routine back.

She just sort of takes it on board with a sigh and a "Yeah! ok! I hear you! ok! ok I got you! ok scream at me why don't you both!" (when we are in fact speaking calmly and clearly).

We have attempted to speak to her on probably 15 occasions over the last 5 years. NOTHING has changed. I even lost it once when I was 23 (only 1.5yrs ago) and punched a hole in a door and yelled at her to get control over it because I can't keep getting abused for absolutely nothing. Nothing changed.

At the most we may have 2-3 weeks where she is fine, no issues, no problems, normal home life. Then it re-starts.

I remember waking up at 2am when I was 13yrs old and finding her fallen in the shower trying to use the bathroom (dad was at work) and I had to pick her up and put her back to bed and she never brought it up. She kept drinking when I went to bed to cause the fall.

We've had extended family at our house over the years and they have since distanced herself from our family as a whole because at these family events she drinks just a few too many and people clearly see she is "past that point" and they give me and my dad this sort of "hmm.." look mixed with "sorry to see this..." and I feel nothing but awkward shame. I have experienced this around 20 times from the age 12 to the age 21-22.

She will say something nice to me or my dad, something trivial, like "Thank you for taking the rubbish out earlier" and the response would be say for example "That's all good" and she will say back "Because I take the fucking rubbish out a lot, and people need to start doing it for themselves!" and you sort of look at her like "Lol..wot?" and this is VERY normal. It happens every time she drinks. Builds you up, tears you down.

I feel mildly anxious around anybody who appears to be intoxicated. Especially people who look potentially aggressive and are already loud to begin with. I avoid alcohol and have had to quit a security job after 3 months because I smelled alcohol everywhere I went and it reminded me of what was potentially awaiting me at home.

Guys this is not normal I think. I am 24 and I feel like a hyper-vigilant child. I am at the point where I can't decide if I feel sorry for her (eg; she stopped working to look after her parent who sadly passed away and unfortunately lost her way and now drinks to forget, she has had it rough) OR if I think you know what, FUCK THIS SHIT (eg; I am not supposed to be emotionally abused for nothing, I am not the reason for someone's drinking, I am doing nothing but trying to help this person stop this pattern, I do not say mean things to cause this reaction, I am allowed to stand up for myself, I do not have to dedicate my life to trying to fix someone who clearly doesn't want to be fixed).

Like, I care about my mom, but this is getting to a breaking point. I feel sorry for my dad because he just keeps shit together. This has always been the case and it feels un natural and fake to push this into a corner like (we don't talk about what happens at night) and everyone acts happy during the day.

She says to him how she provides everything but actually hasn't had income in 9yrs. He pays for absolutely everything. I am so lost right now.



What are some questions I could ask myself to better understand if I am fucked up from this life or not?

Tell me shit I need to hear, fuck I don't know anymore.

Just help me. Please.

2003 Explorer 4.6 accelartion off and on? I notice on some days when I WOT the car kicks down gears, locksup and HAULS! Response being instantenious and torque pulls HARD. Other days WOT response is hesitant or acceleration is sluggish. Sometimes when sluggish itll sound like the engine is hesistating to burn fuel or air and the higher up in RPM i go it start to catch and begin feeling like as if someone ramming air or fuel into the cyclinders giving me more power. Any ideas what this may be?

You’re not sick, you’re a liar
My friend pretends to have one of those invisible illnesses like fibromyalgia (even tho her symptoms change like the weather and don’t always match up).

She also has a colourful yet questionable medical history. It doesn’t affect my life no but I rant here so I don’t rant in the wrong place and upset anyone.

Every time she goes to bed at 6am cos she’s up all night watching a movie yet the next day she’s “bed bound” from her disability. Like no, you had 90mins of sleep cos you have 3 kids.

Every time she gets shit faced drunk she is “bed bound” and in pain the next day cos of her disability. Like no, you’re hungover, and probably had no sleep.

If someone mentions they have a symptom suddenly she has the symptom. New symptoms arise whenever the attention surrounding it dies down.

She has long claimed to have been diagnosed but has also complained about doctors refusing to diagnose her .

She was even slurring from a bottle of wine once and claimed her illness makes her slur when everyone knew the truth.

She once claimed to have anaemia that would kill her, she recently claimed it’s gone away (and then it came back but she doesn’t mention it now so maybe it went away again idk).

She once claimed to need a walking stick from a slipped disc she put out seven years ago (they go away after eight weeks and she’s never needed surgery etc ) but has no problems walking etc.

She claims to have been cured of her existing diagnosed mental health conditions. She claims heart problems she cannot possibly have, claimed anorexia one day and “lol I love food so much wot a pig” the next.

She’s not a bad person but OMG this part of her personality gratessss.

97 Miata, rough idle, maybe misfire at idle and fuel trim CEL i have a 97 Miata that for the past couple days has had a roughish idle. when stopped the rpms drop like its gonna stall but hasn't yet. They just go low back to normal low back to normal etc for a couple seconds then it stops. But if I touch the gas and mess with the rpms it happens again. Also I have a CEL for my EGR that I haven't gotten around to thoroughly cleaning. I took off the valve on the intake side and hosed it with carb cleaner a while ago but that's it. I noticed that sometimes at idle theres a "pop" I can feel almost like a misfire at idle and happens about once every second but no misfire code. And no misfire under WOT or driving at all. Also when braking hard/aggressively in neutral rpms drop lower again. Finally I have a p0170 code for bank1 fuel trim. Sorry for the wall of text.

What do you want from me... He messaged me on Sunday night after we saw each other on Tuesday night because I wanted closure. I went no contact and hadn't contacted him at all. He asked me how my weekend was, and then found out I was moving out, which we were supposed to do together. He got upset, and said so you don't think we have a chance anymore, you don't want to be with me anymore? I was like WOT..... you said you don't love me anymore when we broke up, you're being unfair.

&amp;#x200B;

He messaged me last night as well because it's his nephews birthday tonight and his whole family want me to come. He said I'm more than welcome to come, as well as to his birthday the night after, but I don't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

His mum told me his dad asked him if we were back together, and he said "not yet." Honestly don't even know what to think. He's still liking my instagram photos.

[23f] looking for a weird socially awkward friend whose a girl? CHECK THIS OUTTTTTT MAYBE ITS MEEE HELLO PERSON READING THIS 😊

Have you been looking for a socially awkward, extremely shy, weird friend who is a girl?

You came to the right PLACE (HOPEFULLY)

I am very awkward and shy, and I've got social anxiety. I have absolutely **no** friends. No lie. I'm not being dramatic.

I want a couple of cool people to talk to daily, but not 24/7. We're both adults who have lives and are busy, right? OK, now that we established this... Pls read on.

**about meeee**
Shy. Awkward. Weird. Love Memes. Love GIFs. Prefer snapchat for talking. I've had a weird life. I love horror movies. I freaking love music so much. I love being outside. I'm not much of a homebody at all.

Recently have gone through a first breakup, so I'd appreciate someone who can have serious AND funny convos.

No creeps.

Will not send nudes.

I've done this once before, and obviously got a bunch of people who didn't read the post.. Or a lot of people who clearly copy and paste messages and send.

Not cool.

If you really wanna be friends, READ WOT I SAY AND DONT SEND ME THE SAME THING U SENT EVERYONE ELSE PLSSSSS


lemme know ur age, gender, where u from/time zone and where we can talk.

Ima about to sleep tho.. So I'll check back tomorrow

ALSO NO H*CKIN GHOSTING EITHER OR ONE WORD RESPONSES PLS. ONLY MSG IF U ARE LEGIT ABOUT BEING FRIENDS

GOODNIGHT POSSIBLE NEW FRIEND 😊

Meds question Hi all,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while (even commented once I think), and finally taking the step to post...

I'm 37, female, mother of 2 awesome crazy boys, software  engineer, and recently diagnosed with ADHD (June this year). The last few months have been a bit crazy in term of realizing how much ADHD has affected and shaped my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I started medication right after my diagnosis, under the care of my family doctor. Started with Concerta, I forget the doses, and had the following effects:

\- a sense of calmness and peace I'd never felt before. Suddenly I could actually be early for something - because the thought of having to wait a few minutes wasn't excruciating

\- the ability to actually do the things I wanted to do. Like, sometimes getting the motivation for a shower would take me forever (because well you have to get undressed, pick clothes, shower, etc... so many steps). On concerta - I thought oh I should shower. And then I would. Just like that.

\- my cellphone addiction went away

\- I could fold a whole load of laundry without interruption

However, I had too many negative side effects... like:

\- I felt like I was half as smart. It was awesome for days at home with the kids. But work days? I couldn't think and problem solve to save my life

\- Some weird compulsion to overshare and overtalk

\- a big mid afternoon crash where I became a bumbling idiot who couldn't even finish a sentence

&amp;#x200B;

So I was put on Vyvanse. I think I started at 10 for a week, then 20, then 30. I'm trialling 40 mg for the second time. Here's what I've found:

\- The first few days I thought my mind was just empty. Then I realized - it wasn't empty. Just quiet. I could hear myself think...

\- I can "see" people better. Not sure if this makes sense... but my whole life I've "judged" people for their action, not who they are, and on vyvanse I can actually see who they are. Anyone relate?

\- I can't feel the drug acting or stop acting... but I can tell the difference. Without it, I can't get the kids ready and leave the house in an ok state in the morning. I'm like a roomba running around.... With it I can act in logical order

\- since starting, my house is in a better shape (not perfect... but it will likely never be. Just not crazy out of control). I'm doing better at work.

&amp;#x200B;

However:

\- I feel some ADHD effects are worse. Like losing and forgetting things. It doesn't have the effect Concerta had of helping me plan ahead and leave at the time I need to leave to be on time somewhere. My phone addiction is back full force. My impulsivity is worse. My Amazon prime shopping has been nuts.

\- not helping with the motivation/activation part of things. I can be at work but not do anything work related, and focus on something home related instead. I'm doing that procrastinating task better than off the pills, but I'm still not getting my work done!

\- my doc wants me to try 40 mg for longer, but I feel anxious at that dose, whereas I didn't at 30. I also don't feel like it gives me any more help with the executive function symptoms, or any better focusing abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

All that to say... anyone else experience that? Anyone try a combo of stimulant/non stimulant meds? I'm also on Zoloft - as I had PPD/PPA after my second was born. But years ago I had been on Wellbutrin when I first broke down in university (cause well, untreated ADHD), and it worked well for me - I've since found out it is used as an ADHD treatment as well. Could it help with those issues?

I know nobody on here is a doctor - but I feel like my GP can only do so much, and apparently referral to a psychiatrist won't happen unless I'm suicidal or at risk of psychosis or something... So if I can get ideas to research and then present to my doctor I might be able to narrow to a better combo for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the WOT...

I take the dodge action

Gather round children and let me dazzle you with a Game Tale! For best effect, listen to (this)\[ r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SpQ1CWi8sQ\] while reading! If you want an introduction for the party, (go here!)\[ r/https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9lxeul/where_are_you_sleeping/\]

Caerwyn, played by  u/thewitchofgeek , is a promiscuous female cross dressing half elf bard with a Scottish accent. Cero is a male tabaxi super sarcastic monk. Blake is a human fighter/wizard multiclass who is young, hasn’t seen the world, has 10 charisma, and is based on yours truly from real life who is utterly uninformed and inexperienced with anything sex or gender related besides “boy” and “girl.” Blake comes from a combat school and sends the session summary—I mean his journal entries--to his teachers (based on real people like Blake is) and classmates (also based on real people) back in school. He expressed his utter confusion about the \*real\* sex of Caerwyn. He figures that if there is this piece of clothing that Caerwyn calls a “binder” that makes her breasts disappear when she appears male, then there surely must be a way for this to work the other way around. In his journal entry his asks the recipient, a teacher, to ask a pansexual friend and her best theatre friend how to find out if Caerwyn is biologically male or female. The teacher writes back that the two friends suggests feeling her crotch, but the teacher strongly advises against that and instead suggests asking her directly.

While the party was visiting an npc ally in the guard’s medbay in the military district, we all left the Bard alone with said Yaun-ti ally that Caerwyn has clearly shown to be into. Upon emerging, Cero makes a joke implying that some act of a sexual nature transpired. Caerwyn makes an attack roll to slap him, but misses because unarmed strikes are strength based. Then the following scene unfolds:

Blake: Hey Caerwyn, can I ask you something, but you have to promise not to hit me.

Caerwyn: Wot is it?

Blake: Are you sure you won’t hit me? \*to DM\* I take the dodge action

Caerwyn: \*frustrated\* Of course.

Blake: You promise? \*to the DM\* I take the dodge action

Caerwyn: \*angry\* Out with it!

Blake: \*to DM\* I walk over to the nearest wall and cast prestidigitation. A text box with “BOY” and “GIRL” appear. \*in character\* Are you a boy? or a girl? \*to DM\* I move my hand back and fourth between the two options and make a “boop” sound with my mouth as I move. Also, I take the dodge action

Caerwyn: \*still slightly frustrated\*I am a woman. Are you really that dense?

Can catalytic substrate failure clog resonators and mufflers downstream? I got a smoking hot deal on some high flow pre-cats for my family sedan a few months ago and have been enjoying them. I've been working with an online tuner, but we have both been busy and my fuel mixture has been rich for quite some time.

Recently, I've been noticing some strange misfires, but the substrate looked fine.

This weekend, I drove 100 miles on the highway aka high speeds, and this seems to have killed the pre-cats. (Complete lack of power and crazy misfires at WOT, knock control through the roof, clogged EGR). Cleaned out my EGR to find some small bits of metallic substrate stuck in the valve. Took a look under the upstream O2 sensor and the metallic substrate is in complete disarray. I definitely have clogged pre-cats and will be getting them replaced with my OEMs.

What I'm wondering, though, is **what effect could this have on the mid-muffler, resonator, and mufflers downstream**?
Some other J series owners have had HFPC substrate failures (due to overheating the cats especially due to an improperly tuned intake) but I don't see much in terms of the rest of the exhaust being clogged.
Is there any way to test for clogging? Backpressure tests by taking apart the catback and checking for air flow?

‘18 TaoTao 50 - Bogs Upon Acceleration Hi all,

Have an ‘18 TaoTao 50 and installed a new carb today. It idles perfect... much better and smoother than the stock carb... but bogs down when throttle is applied. Apply throttle very slowly and it will finally accelerate smooth up to speed... a bit faster than the stock carb at WOT... and keep running well as long as throttle is applied... then bog again when accelerating after letting off the throttle for a few seconds. Also notice a strong gas smell. Can’t find any leaks.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

I'm not a good person. Some background first: My partner and I recently went from working retail to starting careers that aligned with our degrees. We are now officially DINKs working in an office environment and earning incredibly decent money. We're now saving for a house, a retired racing greyhound, travel, and fast German cars. We're going to be living our dream childfree lives and I'm PSYCHED! I'm still adjusting to office life as it's different to the retail grind. Personally, I like it a lot. We both got incredibly lucky and were offered jobs at the same place for the same positions, so now our desks are right next to each other. We've worked together before, so this was awesome. One of our friends helped us get the job, so networking works! So does knocking an interview out of the park.


So one of our coworkers is having a baby and they threw a baby shower in the office. Coming from retail, I thought this was weird (I've never really been around people that were pregnant and older than me in a professional environment. I was used to working with college aged people doing the grind). I asked some of my office friends if this is a normal occurrence and sure enough it is. Okay, I thought, that's a new one, but all the power to them. We come into the office and oh boy, they are setting up the baby shower in the middle of the office, right in front of my cubicle. They've got chairs in a giant circle and some really sad looking Crock-Pot looking sludge in the office fridge.


My partner and I are both childfree. I'm snipped. She loves this subreddit and the idea of pregnancy terrifies her as much as a gut bursting xenomorph terrifies Ripley. We're not too thrilled about the party, but we are adults and will deal with it. There's a lady from a neighboring department going around asking people last minute if they were wanting to join the shower. Now this lady is certifiably insane. She thinks demons have possessed a coworker and that's why she's sick all the time, believes in chemtrails, smart-dust (had to Google that one), and is a mombie. It seems her identity has been wholly consumed by her child(ren), which is common I've noticed. So she comes up to me and says:


"Are you going to be joining us?"


"I'm good. Thanks."


She just stares at me with these empty, beady condescending eyes like I just pissed on her mom's grave. I said this is a respectful way too. I had work to do. I'm new, I have to produce quality work, because that's what you do in my situation. I knew of this lady, so I've tried to avoid her, but when forced to interact, I'm incredibly professional.

Her response, in a flat, serious regard: "No, FsDxRAGE, you're not good. You're not a good person."

&amp;#x200B;

U FOOKIN WOT M8?!

&amp;#x200B;

I've got thick skin and am not easily bothered by people. This didn't bother me as much as it came outta nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I laughed at her,  which elicited her response "It was just a joke!" to cover her ass if I went to HR.  *Sure* it was. One of my colleagues (that needs an exorcism to get healthy) heard this and was like, *did she just say that to you?* My partner was out of earshot, but approached us a second later and asked what was so funny and I said, "I'm not a good person apparently." She's got tough skin too and had a similar response as I did. I guess this is what office like is going to be like? No one knows we're together or else we'd get Bingo'd I'm sure of it. The shower was a loud affair. I couldn't concentrate, so I watched The Food Ranger on YouTube and dreamed of our future exotic travels for 45 minutes while they all swooned over the upcoming xenomorph that was to burst forth into this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I just totally avoid her.  She now believes the earth is flat so I guess the joke's on her.

Leaked Worldstar Hip-Hop video reveals real reason behind MonteCristo absence from Blizzcon. In a since removed video found on Worldstar Hip-Hop, an altercation is seen taking place in what appears to be a Blizzard boardroom. The video begins with a flurry of movement and multiple parties backing away from the table to reveal Christopher "MonteCristo" Mykles and Jeff "you like em' i nerf em" Kaplan engaged in a physical altercation. As he throws Mykles from his chair, Kaplan is heard saying "you want some Kimchi with deez nuts ya little bitch boy" to which Mykles replies "I'll fuck you harder than you fucked Mcree". The video continued for a few more minutes of out of focus, grade-school level wrestling in which Mitch "uber" Leslie began casting the tussle as it moved into it's later stages.

Michael "mykl" Padilla was able to gain access to a confidential Blizzard Kik-group where he discovered the cause of the altercation. Apparently during an end-of-meeting discussion about the recently released Red Dead Redemption 2, MonteCristo had said how he felt it was the best game he had ever played. Quiet engulfed the meeting as Kaplan nervously laughed and said "u fokin wot m8". The text chat goes on to discuss how MonteCristo looked him dead in the eye and said "BEST. GAME. I'VE. EVER. PLAYED"  at which point Kaplan jumped over the table and the video began.

Confidential source Soe Gschwind Penski elaborated that the altercation ended with Kaplan leaving the room and screaming "You're out!" "If you're gonna come into my house! MY HOUSE! with that Rockstar Games bush-league bullshit then you can try and find BlizzCon tickets with the rest of the fuckin neckbeards. Good luck, they sold out in 2015"

Neither Kaplan nor Mykles could be reached for comment but, Jason "Jayne" Conroy DM'd us on twitter only to say "SPICY JUICE"

Hi my name is Darkeyed Storming Parshendi Wayne Sanderson and I have dark brown eyes (that’s how I got my name) with long red hair that reaches my mid-back and a covered safe hand like a good vorin and a lot of people tell me I look like Elayne Trakard (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Brandon Sanderson but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a parshendi but my skin is smooth and white is. I have pale white skin. I’m also a mist born, and I go to a radiant training in the city of Urithiru in Scadrial where I’m on the first ideal (I’m fifteen). I’m a world hopper (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly white. I love Shadesmere and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a white dress with white lace around it and a purple white boots . I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Urithiru. It was storming and weeping so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of lighteyes stared at me. I told them to storm off.

“Hey Darkeyed!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Szeth-son-son-Vallano wearing white the night he was to kill a king!

“What’s up Szeth?” I asked.

“Nothing.” he said shyly.

But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.

1979 GS550 Low power/no throttle response My gs550 has little to no throttle response, not sure what's wrong with it.

I've replaced the coils since they were reading different resistance.

Ignition is an electronic Dyna-S module

Battery is low on voltage but it still starts on Kickstart and idles.

When I put it into gear and ride it has extremely sluggish throttle response even at WOT I can barely make it up to 35mph.

Could this be due to low spark because of the low/dead battery?

More than you probably wanted to know about Octane, compression ratios, and general combustion mechanics. A while back, I wondered you could use water injection to use a lower Octane fuel in a sports car. This led me down a rabbit hole of questions. So I went on a kick trying to understand how octane, compression ratio, temperatures, water/meth injection all actually worked at a physics and math level. I was surprised at how sparse and frustrating it was to find the actual details I wanted to know. Many many people post non-technical misunderstandings in response to questions and not many mechanical engineers write engineering minded articles on the subject. Since I've done the leg work of collecting it all, I figured I'd share it with the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm a computer engineer. Not a mechanical one. I've had many of the same physics courses but I'm sure it's a little rusty at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Glossary :**

TDC - Top Dead Center. This is when the piston is at it's highest position.

BDC - Bottom Dead Center. This is when the piston is at it's lowest position.

Compression Ratio - The volumetric ratio of BDC / TDC.

DCR - Dynamic Compression Ratio, the useful compression ratio number. Explained more below.

ECR - Effective Compression Ratio, after vacuum or turbo boost is factored into the DCR.

WOT - Wide open throttle.

Octane Number - An attempt to simplify multiple physical properties of a gas/alcohol based fuel for easy distribution. More below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Compression Ratio:**

This number basically means jack squat from a usefulness point of view. The timing of the intake and exhaust valves change the compression ratio to the DCR. The DCR is the ratio between when the intakes close and TDC. This is the compression ratio that the fuel / air mixture actually experience from the pistons movement. In a naturally aspirated WOT situation, this should be fairly close to the ECR.

The ECR is reduced by closing the throttle, causing less fuel and air to enter the cylinder. However it can be "boosted" above the DCR with turbos, super chargers, and even clever air movement hacks with NA engines.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Find Your Engine's DCR:**
Since manufacturers rarely give out this information I was left wondering how I could find this out. Thankfully with the help of people posting compression test results on forums and math this is doable without any testing on my part. For my engine, the compression tests yield around 155 PSI at TDC. Since compressing air causes it to heat up and increase in pressure we can't just say this equals 155 psi / 1 ATM, we need the following formula for adiabatic processes. That is the process that happens quickly so heat loss is assumed negligible.

P2 = P1 \* (V1/V2)\^1.4

155 PSI = 14.7 PSI \* (DCR)\^1.4

155/14.7 = DCR\^1.4

(155/14.7)\^(1/1.4) = DCR = \~5.4

Here we have a DCR of 5.4 on an engine with a stated compression ratio of 9.2.

&amp;#x200B;

**DCR and Efficiency + Atkinson Cycle:**

For an Otto cycle engine (Most engines), the piston compresses the mixture as much as it expands after combustion. The peak theoretical efficiency, and thus actual efficiency, increase as the compression ratio increases. I unfortunately can not find where I'd originally learned this but the formula I have is below.

Theoretical Efficiency Peak = (1-1/DCR\^.4) = (1 - 1/5.4\^.4) = 49% for my engine. In reality though most engines will achieve roughly half this so 24.5% for my engine.

For Atkinson though this changes. As the compression stroke is shorter than the expansion stroke it can extract more of the energy from the expanding air than an Otto cycle engine at the cost of a lower power density (HP / Liter). I don't have the math for these engines. But the 2016 gen Prius achieves around 40% thermal efficiency. (I've personally tested my wife's 2010 gen Prius to 37.5% thermal efficiency)

&amp;#x200B;

**Octane:**

Octane actually describes multiple aspects of a gasoline or alcohol fuel in a simplified manner. Possibly the most important of these is the auto-ignition temperature. While how lean / rich a AF mixture is can affect this temperature somewhat, for the purpose of this post we'll assume it's just = to the fuel. Approximate values for Octane levels below. Note that these do vary from location to location online.

&amp;#x200B;

Octane : Autoignition \*C

87 : 285

89 : 335

91 : 385

93 : 435

110+ : 367 - 100% Ethanol. Explained below.

110+ : 433 - 100% Methanol, or "race fuel"

&amp;#x200B;

If the AF mixture exceeds the autoignition temperature due to compression this can result in simultaneous combustion of the entire AF mixture. If this occurs before TDC it can be referred to as engine knock. Engine knock can also be caused by a spark plug firing too soon or hot spots on the cylinder head or walls creating another ignition point. While close, this combustion is not an instantaneous process. There is a short delay and a required thermal energy uptake to the fuel before it will combust.

So what's up with ethanol? Why does it have such a high Octane rating with a relatively low autoignition temperature. The two biggest reasons are the cooling effect of vaporization at 3 times that of gas and a much higher ratio of fuel to air than gasoline. We'll go over this more below.

These are not the only physical attributes that affect Octanes ratings. Flame speed propagation is generally faster the lower the Octane rating, energy required to begin combustion is typically lower with lower octane ratings, etc. These attributes are also somewhat affected by lean / rich mixtures or even how well the AF is mixed.

Additionally, know that US Octane != European Octane. The way this number is determined varies around the world. I believe US 93 \~= Euro 95.

&amp;#x200B;

**ECR and Temperature:**

So how do we know if our AF temperature will exceed the auto-ignition temperature? Why more math of course :P But now we have to take into account the ambient air temps, and thus saftey margins have to be built in by car manufacturers to make sure we don't have engine knock on hot days. Temperatures must be in kelvin. We'll use 115 \*F (hot day plus engine bay heat) and 32 \*F below.

Tcompressed = (Pcompressed / (1 ATM \* DCR) \* T intake-air)

155 PSI / (14.7 PSI \* 5.4) \* 320k = \~628 \*K or 355 \*C

155 PSI / (14.7 PSI \* 5.4) \* 273k = 535 \*K or 262 \*C.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that on a hot day, 91 Octane would be a minimum, but on a cold day 87 may be sufficient. I've yet to find a clear answer from a professional on the subject so don't go throwing 87 octane in your high performance engine during the winter. Gasoline producers also have winter and summer "blends" that could make this math incorrect due to 87 != 87. But the math does suggest that this should work fine strictly from a temperature point of view with true to their Octane fuels.

&amp;#x200B;

So what about the case for the turbo / supercharged engine? Well the math still applies, just with hotter intakes and the use of the max expected ECR instead. My engine happens to be a turbo with a max of 18 PSI of boost. I'm using 140 \*F as the post intercooler temps pulled from forum posts on the subject for similar cars on summer days.

ECR = DCR \* (Pboost + 1 ATM) / 1 ATM

ECR = (18 PSI + 14.7 PSI / 14.7 PSI) = 12

So to get the temps

Tcompressed = (Pcompressed / (1 ATM \* ECR) \* T post-intercooler-intake-air)

155 PSI / (14.7 PSI \* 5.4) \* 335k = 657 \*K or 384 \*C

&amp;#x200B;

**Cooling Effect of Fuel / Water-Methanol:**

The astute may notice that this end point temperature is within rounding error of auto-ignition of 91 Octane. This is the minimum recommended for my car. But how can this be? The hot spots would surely cause this to knock.

Well, they would, if it weren't for the heat of vaporization of the gasoline itself. This evaporation cools the compressed air. Assuming no compounding effect of the cooling the math boils down to the following for a stoichiometric AF mixture of 14.7.

Evaporization / Ratio AF / Specific Heat of Air= (304.4 joules/gram / 14.7) / 1 joule/gram\*C) = \~20.7 \*C drop.

This brings our 384 \*C down to \~363 \*C. A 22 \*C buffer to work with on hot days.

Note that at WOT my car's computer will also run rich. This has additional cooling effect and also a small power boost that we'll cover later.

But what about water / meth injection? Well assuming you stick to 100% water, this effect can be much more pronounced due to waters much greater heat of vaporization. Take the following case where we inject 15% water to fuel.

 (2257 joules/gram / (14.7\*.15)) / 1 joule/gram\*C)  = 23 \*C drop.

This is similar to raising Octane of the fuel by 1 point. This concept has been [investigated by car manufacturers](https://jalopnik.com/how-the-absurdly-expensive-bmw-m4-gts-water-injection-w-1760175847) to lower emissions and boost DCR's for better efficiency but no commercial products have been released to my knowledge.

Both of these pale in comparison to Ethanol. Ethanol additionally has the 2nd advantage that it mixes with water allowing small ratios of water to be mixed directly into the fuel for cooling purposes. But for now we'll stick to E100 (96% ethanol with 4% residual water)

 (913 joules/gram / 9.6) / 1 joule/gram\*C) = \~95 \*C drop.

This combined with a slower flame speed and more energy require to ignite the fuel result in a very high octane for ethanol.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lean / Rich and the Outcomes:**

While the exact ratios vary here's the general consensus. 14.7 is stoich. If combustion is perfect there will be no fuel left and all oxygen will have been consumed. In reality this is not true, but this number is conveniently where catalytic converters happen to work most efficiently.

If you go a little lean, say 16:1 AF, you will get better combustion of the gas available so less unburnt gas will move through with the exhaust.

If you go a little rich, say 12.2:1 AF, you will get more complete consumption of the oxygen available, leading to more power per stroke at the cost of expelling unburnt gas.

This ratio also affects the pollutants put out by the engine. See [here](https://rusefi.com/wiki/index.php?title=Manual:Software:Fuel_Control) for more details.

&amp;#x200B;

**Flame Speed, Timing, and Computers to the Rescue:**

In a perfect engine, the AF would mix perfectly as vapors, the TDC temperature would hit the exact point needed for autoignition ([HCCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVWZFdb_AGc)) of the entire mix regardless of the piston, cylinder wall, and incoming air temperatures, there would be little to no pollutants, efficiency would be the ideal for the DCR, and there'd be no need for spark plugs or timing. But the perfect engine can't exist due to all these variables in the real world.

Due to combustion not being instantaneous and ECR not always being equal to DCR, the spark plug must ignite the AF mix before TDC is reached. This timing must be set such that the most pressure is experienced right after TDC. Since different fuels, octanes, AF mixtures can change the speed this flame propagates there can be some negative consequences.

In a carbureted computer free engine, the timing is mechanically controlled. A predetermined fuel must be used and air temperatures can not be adjusted for. This can lead to undesired behavior with large temperature swings throughout the year. My understanding is this is the reason for winter and summer mixes of gasoline. IE 87 octane in summer != 87 octane in winter. Because gas is provided regardless of whether it is burnt, the engine can flood when it fails to start.

In a fuel injected computer controlled engine, this changes. It can detect preignition (knocking) and retard timing (move the spark timing closer to TDC) to avoid damaging the engine if too low of an Ocatane is used for the conditions. Similarly, it can conservatively advance timing (move it further before TDC) to optimize the power and efficiency of the combustion stroke. The computer typically has air intake sensors such as MAF (Mass air flow) or MAP (Mass air pressure) and output O2 sensors (measuring the remaining amount of oxygen in the exhaust) to determine if the correct AF mixture is being used. They can control the fuel injectors at the microsecond levels to very precisely inject the desired amount of fuel. This prevents the "flooded engine". It also means if for some reason fuel is flowing faster or slower (to an extent) through the injector, the timing of the injector can be adjusted to compensate.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. I think that covers what I set out to explain. I'll look into posting the Excel sheet I created for this later and linking to it here. A interesting side note is [Mazda's attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhzMGbQXmY) to get HCCI by going up to the edge with a supercharger and using the spark to push it just over the edge with computer timing just after TDC.

2-300rpm idle, dang ol, ej22 Pesky idle problem

I have a 1991 subaru legacy ej22 a/t fwd and it has developed an issue. It startes with the cel coming on when the weather got cold i assumed the cheap chinese o2 sensor couldnt keep up temperature wise and it tripped a code. I ignored it. Then the cranking issues.

On cold morning 41 degrees F (im in georgia, thats cold) the car would crank up fine but if i stopped, say at a store and got back to the car while the engine was warm it didnt want to crank. Id feather the gas and itd roar to life after a few cranky seconds, I also developed an idle issue. The idle kept dropping to 3-200 rpm  then bounce back to 500 slowly. If i was turning sharp and the rpms dropped i got a nice stalled engine. It would crank right back up and id be on my way but its an issue. I diagnosed it as ecu coolant temp sensor. Replaced it, bye bye cel. Then the stuttering came about. My wife and mother drove the car while i was at work. After i started driving after work i noticed unless you gave it 3/4 throttle from a stop, it barely moved, the lag between throttle input and engine output was unreal. It was as if it was being held back. If you went WOT it'd jump off the line full of life but not if you eased into it.

But wait theres more! While you were crusing the car would jerk horribly as if it was starving for fuel or flooded, it bucked, shaked and would only go away if you where increasing speed or would go away for maybe a minute if you go WOT then let off. I thought fuel pump, went to the autoparts store that had a different wiring setup and there was 2/3 the size of my pump but claimed the pump went to my car. I took a paid day off (my only one) to go to the salvage yard, found a 96 fuel pump, swapped the pump from the 96 housing to the 91 so the sender would work, driving on the highway and here comes the shutter about 15 mins into cruising, well ****. I replaced the vaccum line to the fuel regulator because it was collapsed. No difference, irratic low idle, sluggish acceleration and shuttering engine persisted, no cel.

I disconnect the o2 sensor, no more shutter, but now cel and the idle is weak still and now is rougher. I go to the local part store and spray the maf sensor, plugged the 02 back in, no more code and drove home. I didnt notice a shutter but it was a shortish trip and the rpms still drop way to low. The plugs and wires are new (6k miles) and i cant figure out while it idles so low. Plan to clean the iacv when im not inbetween houses and have a physical address to get the gasket mailed too. The engine has always had a mild miss, not enough to trip a code but noticible puff at idle. I tested using smoke in vaccum booster for vaccum leaks, i saw nothing. Any suggestions?

Rough idle (91 1.6L) - what to look for? My '91 NA6 has a pretty rough idle and cutoff at high-RPM. When cold and hot it will idle dip (much more when cold) and is generally very rumbley. I have new sparks and wires in and they didn't do anything as well as multiple bottles of techron over a few tanks of gas.

My timing pully has separated so it is hard to get the timing to make sure that is correct however when the car is moving it runs perfectly(besides the cut-off at WOT).

On high rpm close to red line (6000RPM+) it will buck and lurch. Almost like there is a fuel cut-off or something. But if I do not go to WOT and slowly bring it up to red line it doesn't always happen. TPS?

Any thoughts my broddas?

Am I[18F] overreacting when it comes to my boyfriend’s [21M] relationship towards a mutual friend [19F]? Hello, I will try to make this short and to the point. For post purposes he [21M] will be Stalin and she [19F] will be Mussolini.

I met Stalin in June of this year, just after he exited a 10-month relationship and began dating him October 31st. Stalin and Mussolini have been friends since 2015, but began a sexual relationship around the same time Stalin and I met. He was my friend before anything, as I wasn’t in the mood for love, and I wanted to enjoy my summer freely.

Stalin and I talked a lot in the beginning of July, but towards the end of July and beginning of August we had somewhat of a falling out. Nothing bad or crazy happened, we just kind of did our own things. Middle of August, we re-meet and start hanging out super often, and as we spend more time together and get closer, Mussolini really becomes a prominent topic. I don’t mind, we aren’t dating, this is what I tell myself, we cool.

Mussolini gets a new boyfriend, Stalin and Mussolini stop sexual relationship, become buds again. No big deal.

As Stalin and I get closer, he makes a HUGE deal about me meeting her and her liking me, how it’s really important that she does, how she’ll probably hate me, makes it really awkward whenever we’re all in the same vicinity (due to school) and just magnifies this entire Mussolini chick.

I end up meeting her and we really click, we get along super well, and it’s not even a concern. We end up talking a lot, she comes to me for a lot of things, and we’re actually good buds.

Stalin starts giving off weird energy, saying things like, “Wow it’s like we broke up” (in reference to him and Mussolini), “it’s like she dumped me for you”. Starts getting weird and pissy about how much she and I talk and how we interact when we’re together. Doesn’t say anything, though.

I notice as time goes on he mentions her a lot, and it’s making me uncomfortable. Stalin tells me this or that reminds him of Mussolini, says he hopes she’s okay, misses hanging out with her, says she’s adorable, and I usually say nothing. They talk a lot, he brings her food sometimes, takes her shifts where they work, hangs out with her often, and she calls him by a pet name. Again, no big deal to me. If he gives me a reason to mistrust him, then I will, otherwise, I see no reason not to trust him.

Then, she calls me when her boyfriend gets into a car accident (he is okay) and to cheer her up I make a joke saying, “Stalin is here also, by default”, and he gets REALLY offended. So offended that he tells me he needs to take a walk to calm down and to let me know if Mussolini wants us to come get her. Big weird, left me really confused.

Sunday, we were invited to my mom’s birthday party, and I really didn’t think I would be able to attend because of a rehearsal I had, but I was so excited we were both not busy at the time of the party. We get back to his and he asks which car are we taking, I ask if we can use his because I’m super tight on gas money and will pay him back once I have it, but I ask because I know he has money. He tells me he doesn’t have the gas or money
and I say okay and we go inside. I start crying (I miss my mom a lot) and he slams the door and that ends our night.

The next day, I ask him (as tradition) what the highs and lows of his day were, and he said the high was going with Mussolini to a downtown restaurant and having lunch and having an amazing convo. Wot?

I thought he didn’t have money (the restaurant I have been to with Mussolini and I know it’s expensive) and was under the impression that downtown was a ways away. Gas and money that I thought he didn’t have. I don’t say anything, an hour passed and he says Mussolini told him about an amazing book he should read and how glad he is for her recommendation.

I bring it up as respectfully as possible and I say, “So, what’s with you and Mussolini?”. This prompts a conversation where he asserts that he should be able to hang out with people of the opposite sex and that people aren’t just people that we have had sex with, they’re people.

I’m here because I’m just not convinced. I feel uncomfortable and I don’t even know why. I genuinely like Mussolini, she’s a sweet girl and we’ve gotten really close in a short amount of time. I see no reason to distrust her, she loves her man. I also love Stalin, but the way he acts and reacts when it comes to her is leaving me really confused. I don’t know if I’m being an insecure idiot, or if I have something to be worried about. He said he would drop her if it would make me feel better, and it wouldn’t. At all. I was honest and I told him it’s not even her, it’s him and he told me he didn’t want to have this conversation right then.

So I’m here. I don’t know what I need, but I would appreciate some guidance on this. Thanks for reading.


TLDR; My boyfriend acts in an odd way towards a mutual friend that he had a sexual relationship with before us getting together, gets mad when I finally ask if anything is going on, and tells me he should have the freedom to be friends with the opposite sex as well as be friends with someone of the opposite sex who he has had sex with. I don’t know if I’m just being insecure and weird, or if my concerns are well founded. It seems to me that his feelings for her are more than friendly feelings.

17/M/Europe/Lithuania Ah after 6 months or so am back again. Long story short, oof. Just oof.

So anyway.
Hello there. General Ke... oh sorry, my bad. Anyway, looking for friends or just some people to talk to .(from 15-18 male or female).

So about me: I like to play games on PC, mostly strategy,ww2 games, realistic games. I dont play popular games like LoL, overwatch, CS:GO, Fortnite, because Im a noob on these games.


Some games that I play:
CoH2, CK2, HoI4, KSP, SWTOR (eu, english server), ETS2, Victoria2, WoT (eu server), SW:EAW, and so on. (Mainly paradox interactive games)

If I dont play games, I listen to sad music, because why not.

I do sports. Basketball and football (soccer).


I like animals. Of course cats and dogs. I have a cat myself.

I speak english. I understand german, a bit of russian as well. When I was younger, I understood spanish as well. Now, not anymore.


I like some good old films: Some WW2 films, War of Worlds, The Martian, Life, Alien:Covenant, Star Wars films and so on.

I like politics (and memes), economics, history (1700-2018 mostly)(and memes).

I like most of the songs. From 1940-2000 (old ones), and some new ones.

I like Star Wars (memes, films, comics(legends and cannon).And of course some games.

I like to read (sometimes).

I like to stay at home and dont go anywhere else, because why not, eh. And watch some memes or YT vids.


I like to talk about anything I guess.

I like to listen what people are talking. Because I dont know what topics to talk, so I usually let people speak and I listen to them with pleasure.
So if you can keep the convo going. Thats a bonus.

I like memes. Well not all. Maybe 98% just.
War memes particulary. *hon hon*

I can talk to people from USA (east coast) time zone to idk maybe Moscow time zone. But I prefer if you would be from europe because time zones...


If you want to chat, PM me.

If we get along well than we could talk later on discord. If you dont want to thats fine for me.

So have a nice day/evening. It is 10pm rn. If I dont reply, I will later or the next day. Usually I reply very fast, because Im always on the phone, even in school during breaks, sometimes if i can, during the lesson...

Did i do this right? Ahhh

2002 Suzuki intruder 1400 - stutters at WOT, wont go over 70mph I have a bike that i have completely redone the fuel system, rebuilt carbs, resync'd, &amp; checked everything i can think of, but the bike still starts to sputter/stutter at WOT in any gear &amp; wont go over 70 mph.

It seems like it is not getting enough fuel, i had a clog in the small screen filter on the front carb just before the bowl that i cleaned out and helped the WOT issue a bit but did not completely fix it or fix the ability to go over 70mph.

I imagine it is still a fuel issue but i cannot figure out what to look at next to remedy that.

Why Linux Actually Sucks - made by me There are a bunch of ways that people say Linux sucks, and they are all correct: (I will, unlike the guy, also give you actual and good examples of why this is true).



**Objective observation #1:
"Linux is bad for games"**




There are currently about 5k Linux-compatible Steam games available. There are about 29k games on Steam. What percentage of the total that is, you can calculate yourself. Also, running quickly down the list, you will notice that not many AAA titles actually support linux, so if you want to play indie titles, then that's nice for you, but you won't play gta5 on it (why would you anyway since take two interactive is worse than EA in some respects).





And this brings us to Whine, the super program-emulator for windows that lets you run windows programs some volatile percentage of the time. I don't know why anyone would use that, but.. ohwait, I know, Photoshop, which brings us to our next point:





**Objective observation #2:
"I can't do my work on Linux"**




Well, you can't. All the photoshop alternatives on Linux aren't Photoshop, or a 1 for 1 approximation. Furthermore, other important programs like Autocad and specialized things like that won't work unless whined and dined. Nuff said.





**Objective observation #3:
"Linux isn't easy to use"**




Ohboy, now we come to my territory.




Installation: bad archaic installers with things like "locale" instead of asking: "Wot language u wont, m9?". When partitioning, some distros don't show descriptions of partitions so you gotta guess on which the system is. Also, totally unintuitive and superfluous step of having to mount the / root on one of them like as a first time user I should even know what that or swap is (inb4 you start whining about man and having 25 other devices around you and wasting 3 hours to google all this stuff. Nah, howbout you make it intuitive, and the hard parts are options for pros, and not necessary for newcomers)




Distros: Every distro ever always has some bigger or lesser bug right out of the box. Whether it is popups displaying errors, or the mouse not working or not working correctly, or the taskbar being messed up, and customization being 4 layers deep instead of a right click. Always something.





Terminal: I know you guys love it because it makes you feel like mr hackerguy, but a) it's not faster, and b) if you type one letter wrong oyu can brick your pc, and that ain't nice unless you like to live on the edge. For actual normal people, you gotta have icons, which you can nicely right click, and make shortcuts (not stupid legit links which don't even display the icon). Normal, basic things should be an option somewhere, and not require 3 hours of googling, and then copy pasting a random command line sausage into the terminal and hoping it is compatible with your distro and your program.




Repos: Oh repos, nice big servers in the sky that have alll the programs you will ever want and you can download anything you want with your synaptic manager, right? Well, yes, if you live in a first world country, and have access to internet 24/7, because good luck just downloading and saving your program as setup.exe that will install a standalone program. No, that's not the Linux way. You can't do that because of le rolling release (tm). God forbid you could just put a bunch of programs on your drive, go to the desert, and install linux for someone. No, each program has "dependencies", which are sharted by other programs, so you save 10 megabytes of space for the terrible inconvenience of never being able to have truly portable programs unless you also back up the 60 dependencies your program depends on. And if oyu have internet, and your repo doesn't have the program you need, good luck adding another to the list and making it work.



Permissions: Ever tried to just add a theme or new icon, or a .desktop file? Well, you can't. Sucks to be you, you can't just drag and drop it like a normal person, you gotta learn how to haxx and cp, and write a long sausage of exact directory locations, because that's the linux way, that's the "fun" way, that's "freedom". I personally just open the folder as root, but you gotta google a lot to get to that level of understanding, and that's most definitely not easy or newcomer friendly.



There is a myriad of other things, but I can't remember right now.







**Observation #4:
"Linux has bad hardware support"**





This is probably not true for the AAA distros, but yours truly had some major problems with wireless on debian, and mouse on antergos and lubuntu, so there is that...





**In short:**
Until users and contributors stop clinging to the terminal as the main means of doing anything on Linux, until then it won't become attractive to normal people. Microsoft is simply superior in all the things I outlined, and you can take any windows, slap on any old program you want, and it will work because it has backwards compatibility, it has legacy programs like draw3d that can be easily accessed, and you have no problem. You might say it's stupid to have 6 different packages of c++ redistributables, I say it's stupid that I can't have a portable program in Linux. Jesus, get your priorities straight. It is 2018, we are talking terrabytes of storage space. Just let me put my portable program on a usb, and give it to my friend without having to pray to the magical cloud in the sky to give me the correct version with 89 dependencies and no portable config.




Thanks for reading.

Dickie's Revenge *“What can you tell me ‘bout your death, Mr. Dickinson?”* The clerk suppressed a yawn as she pored over the processee’s file.

*“A mistake’s been made, mis’ess!”* The dazed man implored*. “Ask me mates! Weez out gallivantin’ not five minutes ‘go. I’m right as rain!”*

*“Feel for your pulse if you like, laddie.”*

The man shot upright, his hands moving in a flurry from wrist to neck and back to wrist. *“Bloody hell!”* he cried out. *“Et can’t be!””*

*“Terribly sorry”* the clerk’s voice droned from behind the file folder. *“What can ya tell me ‘bout your death, then?”*

*“Not a goddamn t’ing!”* The man’s voice cracked with panic. *“One second I’m raisin’ hell wit’ the boys and next t’ing ya know I’m flyin’ like Cap’n Britain through a bloody tunnel o’ light.”*

*“But no memory of a bus?”*

*“Wotz that s’posed t’mean?”*

*“There was an accident at the intersection of Wembley South and Northhamptonshire involvin’ an inebriated pedestrian and a double-decker bus.”*

*“Yer not sayin’ that plonker’s me?!”*

*“‘Fraid that’s the gist of it, son.”*

*“Bugger me sideways!”* Dickie cried out. *“I’m only nineteen!”*

The clerk raised both hands to adjust the listing mass of her beehive hair.

*“Yer pos’tive et sez ize ran ov’r by a bus?”*

*“A double decker bus, yes.”*

*“Crikey Moses!” He moaned. “The Soho sods ‘r ‘avin’ a foking laff!”*

*“Language please, Mr. Dickinson.”*

*“It’s Dickie for chrissake.”*

*“Right. Dickie then. Tell me about this evening.”* The clerk raised her bifocals to the overhead fluorescent lights in search of a smudge.

*“Well we woz at Dingwall’s t’see ‘Ian and the Shits’ play. I r’member that. Oh ‘n whilz we woz bladderin’ up at the bar thes fucknugget Duncan starts yappin’ out ez arse ‘bout ‘ow eez jes seen Lemmy at a pub en King’s Cross. We legged et like billy-o t’see fer areself.”*

*“And so ya connected with your mate in King’s Cross?”*

*“Which mate’s that?”*

*“This Lenny feller ya just mentioned.”*

*“LEMMY FROM MOTORHEAD, NUMPTY!”*

A mustachioed clerk with a thick French accent whispered emphatically “Monsieur, please!” through the plastic leaves of a decorative plastic tree separating the two desks and pointed to the “QUIET VOICES QUIET TRAILS” sign hanging from an electrical pipe in the open ceiling. On the other side of the desk from the man sat a young girl of six with green sunken eyes that presently were fixed on the majestic spikes of Dickie’s mohawk.

“*BUGGER OFF YA CHEESE-EATING SURRENDER MONKEY!“* Dickie barked reflexively at the man. He then turned calmly to the female clerk across from him and whispered*: “What’s the little girl doin’ en thes place?”*

*“Bein’ processed like you ‘n ev’ry other soul ‘ere.”* The clerk replied blandly.

*“Well that’s bloody awful.”*

Dickie turned to the girl. *“Hiya. Like me hairdo?”*

The girl stared back wide-eyed.

*“What they call ya?” Dickie asked softly.*

*“Elizabeth”* she whispered with nary a sound.

“*Busy busy!*” The clerk interrupted. “Ya recall makin’ it to the pub in King’s Cross?”

*“Good to know ya Elizabeth.”* Dickie looked into the frightened girl’s eyes and lingered there momentarily.

*“Mr. Dick…..Dickie rather....I must ask you to stay focused. Did you get to your destination?”*

*“Yeah. Lemmy wuddn’t there o’course. Ask’d some piss-artist playin’ darts eff eed been en. Bloke nearly coff’d iz shrivel’d liver up laffin’. Bollocking cockwomble Duncan.”*

*“Is that yer last recollection?”*

*“Last t’ing I r’member ez chattin’ up a tasty trollop out front. Had ‘er a pair o’ strawberry creams,*

*Lordy McGee.”*

*“Focus lad.”*

*“So a git rozzer shows up jes then wavin’ iz dildo in our face sayin’ scram or get charged with loiterin’ so off we went.”*

*“And all blank after that is it?”*

*“S’pose. Doze et say any’ting on that paper ‘bout the maniac who kilt me? Musta been a reddie he run wot took me out.”*

As if on cue the clerk began to read in monotone*: “The victim was in the centre of the road shaking his bare hindquarters at the 12-tonne vehicle just prior to impact.”*

*“O fer fucksake!”* Dickie wailed. *“Etz werse now, innit!?”*

*“I’ll ask one last time. Very important.”* The clerk’s voice was momentarily emotive. *“Nothing we’ve spoken ‘bout’s jogged your memory of the accident itself?”*

*“Naw we wuz legless from the rum by then, missie. Why ask anyway?”*

*“Dark thoughts dark trails, lad. Memories of that nature are terribly dangerous in this place. Need to be handled with care. Few more questions. Your parents alive?”*

*“Me mum’s dead.”*

*“That recent?”*

*“Naw ize ‘er age.”* He replied with a nod to Elizabeth*.*

*“Close were ya?”*

*“Can’t say.”*

*“Father?”*

*“Jailbird, hope to christ eez dead.”*

*“Siblings?”*

*“Steppie, complete ‘n utter wankstain.”*

*“Alive?”*

*“No earthly idea.”*

*“Other family?”*

*“Gotta git fer an uncle, useless.”*

*“Ya married?”*

*“Funny.”*

*“Children?”*

*“COME ON NOW!”*

The clerk checked boxes up and down a form while humming several octaves off-key to muzak playing throughout the facility. She then closed the file and extended a limp hand across her desk. *“Been a pleasure in a way. There’s a lift down the hall. Take that to first level, out the front, follow signs to Script Development, building 9, take this notice, good luck t’ya. Next!”*

Dickie stood, flashed a smile in Elizabeth’s direction and glanced down at the notice.

&amp;#x200B;

***Welcome to The Processing Center.***

***Regrettably you are dead. All deaths are final. This is not a verdict or judgement. It is an organic fact.***

***We are here to facilitate your send off. All that is required of you is to reflect on your existence and select a brief joyous memory to accompany you into the afterlife.***

***The Staff of Processing Center 891D229VE4.***

&amp;#x200B;

In the lift alongside Dickie was an older man outfitted in a tuxedo and red velvet bowler hat.

*“Press ‘1’ there chap if you would. Cheers. Bertram Plank from Knightsbridge. You are?”*

*“Dickie.”*

*“Quite an evening we’re having, Dickie.”*

*“How’s a rich toff like you give up the ghost?”*

*“Massive heart attack at the Duke of Fife’s dinner party. Put a damper on dessert service I imagine. Poor dear Maggie my wife.”*

*“Hard cheese there, mate.”*

*“Don’t mean to cry on your shoulder. What brings you here, son?”*

*“Bus run me ov’r.”*

The man offered a polite chuckle and patted Dickie on the shoulder.*“Truthfully son, what was it?”*

The windowless concrete structure the two processees emerged from resembled a drab tenement block. Both men noticed a peculiar quality to the outside light which seemed to lack warmth or any discernible source.

They made their way across a sprawling faux lawn on a path that meandered downhill toward a towering billboard featuring an illustrated woman straight out of a ‘50’s Coca-Cola ad, hand cupped over her mouth and the words “JOYOUS THOUGHTS JOYOUS TRAILS” filling a large speech bubble. Beyond that was the first of what appeared to be giant hangars stretching into the distance.

As they drew closer it became apparent that the purpose of the hangars was for the building of sets and the atmosphere was that of a bustling studio lot. All around them creations were at various stages of development: a replica of Britain’s WW2 Spitfire fighter plane; the facade of a Victorian country manor; a painted backdrop depicting the white cliffs of Dover; the Terracotta-tiled courtyard of a French cafe and most notably, what must have been a forty foot facsimile of a carnival ferris wheel surrounded by scaffolding.

Dickie and Bertram walked wide-eyed down the narrow dirt road taking in the images. Just beyond the final hangar a sign reading “Script Development” pointed to another nondescript concrete structure where dozens of processees stood in front waiting for their names to be called.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“Ev’r see The Sex Pistols?”* The Scriptwriter asked with his head buried in Dickie’s file.

*“Course I seen The Pistols. Bummed a fag off Vicious last year en Bethnal Green.”*

*“Worst musician ‘n rock ‘n roll hist’ry.”*

*“Didn’t matter diddit?”* Dickie snapped back.

*“That’s right, cuz iz amp’s a prop. Nev’r been plugged en. Bloke’s a circus monkey.”*

*“Seen ‘em play ‘ave ya?”*

*“Once. Queensway Hall in Dunstable.”*

*“Good, yeah?”*

The Scriptwriter’s head sprang up as if stirred from a dream.

*“They opened wit’ Anarchy. The dog’s bollocks mate! Bodies flyin’ ev’ry which way. Ize head ov’r arse ‘n starkers ‘fore Rotten sang a word. Thought ize a gon’r!”*

*“Did’ya ‘ave that same spod haircut then?”* Dickie asked with a grin.

*“Naw - it wuz bleached out, quite a mane.”* The Scriptwriter’s attention returned to the paperwork*. “Nev’r had the knackers t’spike m’self up.”*

*“The Ramones ‘r playin’ Aylesbury next week Friday. Foking kilz me t’be tits up fer that.”*

*“Speakin’ ‘o which, we’d best get goin’, schedules run tight ‘round ‘ere.”*

*“Up t’you.”*

*“I’m Fergus Smythe, sixth generation east ender, earned a livin’ writin’ telly adverts, OD’d on dope en a condemned shithole two blocks from where me wife ‘n nine month old girl were waitin’ fer me, dinner on the table. Eva and Charlotte. Me inna nutshell.”*

*“That cheered me up.”*

*“Yer turn.”*

*“Namez Dickie, got hit by a foking bus, letz see, unemployed, work’d on the hobble tho paintin’ ov’r graffiti, wot elz, ize singer in a band called The Royal Butt Plugz, ya might’a known us as The RBPz.”*  Dickie glanced up for an acknowledgment that was not forthcoming. *“They’ll need a new frontman now.”*

*“East Ender?”*

*“That’s right. Tower Hamlets ‘riginally. Been livin’ on the streets tho en Peckham since me cocksplat fotter went off t’jail.”*

*“Thatz a start. Read the notice, did’ya?*

*“Yeah I read that tosh.Yer foking dead as a doornail so shut the fuck up. And while yer at et think up a cheery mem’ry. Batshit.”*

*“Batshitz the only constant, mate.”* The Scriptwriter smiled and stretched his spindly legs onto the metal desk before him*. “How ‘bout life? Ya get yanked outta sweet nothingness onto a rock spinnin’ round a blindin’ ball o’ fire thatz hurtlin’ thru space a million miles an hour t’ward a monster hole that wolfs down stars like foking bisquits. And ya think thes ez strange?”*

Dickie sat motionless, his brown eyes fixed on the carpeted floor. A distant muted thrum from the nearby hangars was all that could be heard.

*“Wanted t‘ave me a tee-shirt shoppe someday.”* He said solemnly.

*“Yeah?”*

*“‘Dickie’s Shirts &amp; Shite’. Make me own designs ‘sted ‘o pawnin’ the same rubbish y’see ev’ry stinkin’ place.”*

The Scriptwriter listened without comment.

*I done thes one ‘ere.”* He unzipped his stud-covered biker jacket to reveal a silk-screened drawing of a crowned buttocks covered with pimples and a large cherry-red plug inserted therein. Above it was a stylistic script that read *The RBPz*. “People stop me on the street to ‘ave a look.”

The Scriptwriter laughed*. “I’d buy that shirt!”*

*“‘Cept fer yer dead.”*

*“As a doornail, yep.”*

Suddenly the room was enveloped in a profound silence. Dickie twirled a chain that hung off a belt loop of his ripped jeans and the Scriptwriter scribbled notes in red ink until the frenetic movement of his hand stopped all at once. He took aim at the wastebasket and let his pen fly end over end, barely missing.

*“Thes place ez hell, innit?”* Dickie asked finally. “*Say et straight up.”*

*“Thought the same t’ing. Figur’d where elz wud a good fer nothin’ baghead go?”*

*“Ya didn’t answer me question.”*

*“Thes place id’nt hell I don’t t’ink. Eff ya don’t gev a fuck et might az well be tho cuz yull bodge yer one shot for cloud nine, yeah. Eternity’s quite a stretch, mate. Who knows eff yull ev’r get yanked out of et again. Two choices: send off en a bloody state o’ rapture or throw a spanner in the works.”*

*“Why ez et yer not bloody sent off yet?”*

*“I wud’nt retty. Still might not be. Ev’ry bloke ya see workin’ ‘ere’s the same. Done four scripts, yer the fifth. Five more after that and I go, end ‘o story.”*

Dickie stared for a long while at a mural painted on the far wall that read “HAPPY THOUGHTS HAPPY TRAILS”, his head shaking almost imperceptibly. *“Complete batshit.”* he mumbled at last.

The Scriptwriter swung his legs off the desk*. “Letz get started.”*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the edge of a reflecting pool dozens of processees stood statue-like gazing into the still black water that gave no reflection in return. On a bench along the perimeter, underneath the fissured columns of a decrepit arcade, Dickie sat next to the young girl he had met during his first moments at the Processing Center. It was something akin to dusk and the odd light drained quickly leaving a grainy brume hanging over the scene.

*“Been ok ‘ave ya?”* Dickie asked Elizabeth.

The girl nodded. “*I’m not even hungry or tired*.”

*“Can I call ya Lizzie?”*

*“That’s what my Auntie Kate calls me.”*

*“Had me a girlfriend once went by Lizzie.”*

*“Was she nice?”*

*“Jeezus no, mean as a rat.”*

*“Does she know you died?”*

*“Good question. No idea really.”*

*“How did you die?”*

Dickie sighed*. “Ya know them big red city buses?”*

The girl nodded.

“*One uv em run me ov’r.”*

“*Did you look both ways ‘fore ya crossed the street*?” Her voice was full of concern.

“*Must not ‘ave. What happened wit’ you*?”

“*My blood got sick*.”

“*Ah, sorry there Lizzie.”* Dickie fished inside his jacket pocket. *“Ya ev’r seen one o’ these?*”

*“Is it money?”*

“*From the States, yep. Called a quarter. You can ‘ave et*.”

*“Thank you.*” She brought the coin close to her eyes. “*Who’s that man?*”

“*Couldn’t tell ya. Abe Lincoln maybe. Shoulda paid more ‘tention en skool*.”

“*I like his funny hair.*”

“*That bloke’s wearin’ a wig - thes ‘ere’s real!”* he said proudly, bowing his head to the girl. “*Can I ask ya a question?”*

“*Yes.”*

*“Yer not ‘fraid ‘r ya?”*

*“Yes.”*

*“Wutcha talk t’yer writer, ‘bout?”*

*“Mum and Dad and Colin.”*

*“Ez Colin yer brother?”*

Elizabeth nodded. *“He’s just two.”*

*“That’s nice. Yull be wit’ ‘im soon, yeah?”*

Elizabeth looked down and began to weep tearlessly.

*“I’m sorry now. Why ya cryin’?”* Dickie patted the girl awkwardly on her head.

*“I want to be with Colin. But I don’t want him to die like me.”*

*“No no...etz not that way! Not that way a’tall! He’ll be inside yer heart ‘n soul, like.”* Dickie brought both hands to his chest. *“You’ll be together, yer whole fam’ly. Etz batshit I know...sorry there, I mean et don’t make no sense, but I swear t’Christ hisself noone’s gonna die.”*

Elizabeth buried her face in the sleeves of her dress. *“I don’t want him to ever get sick.”*

*“Lemme tellya - Colinz gonna live t’be an ole codger. Betcha a million quid!”*

Dickie reached out and shook the girl’s hand.

*“Will you be with your family too?”* Elizabeth asked.

*“Naw, that’s...I’m not lucky like you. But Fergus me writer, heez a gud egg, I like wot he done. He won’t cock-up me send-off…mean to say I trust the bloke.”*

*“I want to hug my family and never let go.”* Elizabeth whispered through sobs.

*“Soon, Lizzie, soon.”*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“GORDON FOKING BENNETT!* Dickie shouted.

He had blinked awake and was moving in near total darkness down a cobblestoned promenade lined with Elizabethan playhouses on both sides, one after the other, each indistinguishable from the next except for the titles on the marquee signs that shone like neon beacons in the night. The atmosphere was festive and a crowd of revelers merrily came and went from theater to theater, the barren sky above them animated with spotlights.

A smiling man approached who Dickie immediately recognized as the French clerk from the Processing Center. *“Pardon me”* he said as he handed Dickie a playbill, pointing across the way from where they were standing. *“You’re at The Globe, four theaters down.”*

*“Wotz that now?”* Dickie asked.

*“Your send-off, Mr. Dickinson.”*

*“Huh? Oh. Right.”*

As the man walked away Dickie yelled out *“Sorry fer what I called ya, mate. Frenchies are ok by me!”* The clerk turned and called out: *“Happy trails young man!”*

There were six plays listed on the bill:

“A Picnic in Giverny” Starring Joan Birdwhistell

“Bye Bye Jerry: Nightfight Over Hamburg” Starring Nigel Pinfield

“Colin’s First Christmas” Starring Elizabeth Walsh

“Dickie’s Revenge” Starring Alex Dickinson

“Kilimanjaro” Starring Bertram Plank

“World’s Faire 1946: A Proposal” Starring Imogen Cromley

As he made his way through the crowd toward The Globe a great ovation rose up from within the Blackfriars Theater where “Colin’s First Christmas” had just ended. Moments later the front doors opened and audience members filed out into a narrow stone portico, many of them smiling, others looking visibly moved.

“Cheerio sweet Lizzie” Dickie whispered to himself.

Upon seeing his name in lights a nervous shudder rattled from some sentient place still awake inside him. Images swirled like dust in a vortex. He saw his mother’s face in a wash of fall sunshine; his childhood cat “Jack the Ripper” staring down from the cardboard roof of the boys-only fort he’d fashioned out of junkyard bricks; Davey - his best friend from elementary school on the day he moved away to Liverpool, waving goodbye in the pouring rain; the Brixton girl’s face just before he kissed her inside a red telephone kiosk across the street from Rough Trade Records.

Just then all of The Globe’s house lights switched on and the entrance doors swung open.

&amp;#x200B;

SETTING

Interior: A seedy nightclub veiled by a thick fog

of clove cigarette smoke. The crowd is mostly teens

outfitted in full punk regalia. The stage is raised several

feet off a sticky floor coated by a permanent veneer of

spilled lager. A spinning disco ball hanging over the drum

kit provides the only stagelight.



\[*1978, A Saturday night, 10PM, along King’s Road in Chelsea, London*\]

\[*DICKIE and DANNY BOY peer out from behind the stage backdrop at*

*a crowd that has rapidly swelled from anemic to full capacity. DICKIE is*

*shirtless and clad in jeans adorned in hand-drawn band logos. DANNY BOY*

*wears jeans and a Ramones t-shirt. Both sport majestic liberty* spike mohawks*,*

*cherry red and bleached blonde respectively.*

&amp;#x200B;

DICKIE: *\[Awestruck\]* Etz a bloody miracle, DB.

DANNY BOY: \[Speechless, shaking his head in disbelief.\]

DICKIE: Jeezus, look there! *\[He points to the right side of the capacity crowd\]* That twist wit’ the bright pink hair ez Anna Rexek.

DANNY BOY: \[Spots the girl in question.\] That bird? Sheez average size, mate.

DICKIE: Fer fucksake. ANNA REXEK - the Soho fanzine prat.

DANNY BOY: *\[Mulls this information over.\]* Yeah, yeah, 48 Thrills. The one wot said we cud bore the tits off a nursemaid.

DICKIE: That’s right. Called us “possibly the worst band in Britain.”

*\[STEWART FILTH and SCURVY crawl under the backdrop to join their mates.*

*STEWART FILTH has his natural red hair slicked back and wears a New York Dolls*

*shirt and jeans, the personification of cool. SCURVY is tall and alarmingly thin,*

*an ill-fitting Blondie shirt draped over* *his bones like a papal robe.\]*

SCURVY: Can ya bleeve et?! Queef of England no-showed at 100 Club! Ole Sanjay got word ‘n ran down there screamin’ “Free punk rock and roll! Butt Pluggers singing! Beer half of a price!”

*\[All of them laugh and take swigs from a bottle of Jagermeister that makes the rounds.\]*

DANNY BOY: Smart move, barz three men deep.

DICKIE: Absobloodylutely brilliant! Jes wish ANNA REXEK wuddn’t ‘ere.

STEWART FILTH: ANNA REXEK?

DICKIE: ‘Er there in the pink hair \[He points in her direction.\] Played a whilz back en Bath, ‘fore ya joined up, pissed on us in ‘er review en 48 Thrills.\]

SCURVY: I like where she says “this is what happens when ya let chimps ‘ave the run of a music shoppe.”

*\[SCURVY and DANNY BOY laugh.\]*

*\[The house lights dim and the band members look at each other wide-eyed.\]*

DICKIE: ‘Fore we head out, listen up. Got me an idear. What say we open wit’ that new one?

DANNY BOY: The number from last night’s practice?  I’m nervous ‘nuff az et ez, mate.

STEWART FILTH: Like that one loads, I’m up fer et.

SCURVY: Long az DICKIE knows the words.

DICKIE: Piece o’ cake.

STEWART FILTH: I’ve a lead after second chorus, gents. Jes occupy yer foking selves whilst I bash the bishop. *\[He straps on his guitar and, in his best Elvis Presley impersonation, begins to sing:\]* “It’s now or never....”

*\[SCURVY guzzles the last of the Jager and grabs his bass as all four emerge*

*in unison from behind the black curtain onto the stage. Their entrance goes almost*

*completely unnoticed by the crowd.\]*

*\[As the band gets situated and tuned, ANNA REXEK appears at the foot of the stage.\]*

ANNA REXEK: Well thes ez awkward innit? I seez ya got a new player. Wot ‘appened t’the acne-faced lad? Embarked on a solo career az he?

DICKIE: Fuck off ya cheeky cowbag.

ANNA REXEK: Careful now - got space in the June issue t’fill. \[She holds up a notepad.\]

STEWART FILTH: Shove that up yer chocolate starfish, darlin’.

ANNA REXEK: *\[Flips them off\]* Eastend yabbos.

*\[STEWART FILTH assaults his low-hanging Flying V with a three cord atom bomb.\]*

*\[SCURVY and DANNY BOY are surprised by the suddenness of the gig’s beginning and*

*lie in wait as a handful of crowd members gravitate to the front of the stage.\]*

DICKIE: \[Facing away from the crowd, he lets out a primal scream:\] I’M A CITY SLAVE!!!

*\[SCURVY and DANNY BOY pounce and all eyes in the club are on the band. The riff is*

*undeniably catchy and full of raw, manic intensity.\]*

*\[Several more punks approach the stage. DICKIE is frozen with his back to the crowd*

*and misses his vocal mark. The three other members make eye contact briefly to*

*acknowledge the miscue. DANNY BOY flashes DICKIE a look of encouragement.\]*

*\[DICKIE grimaces then turns and grabs the mic in both hands.\]*

**I SEE YER LOOKIN’ EDGY IN THE LATEST PUNK ROCK FASHION**

**FER A REAL KICK COME JOIN ME FOR A DAILY WELFARE RATION**

*\[The band punctuates the verse with a four bar refrain that ends with*

*STEWART FILTH and SCURVY dropping out as DANNY BOY plays a*

*snare fill that leads them all back in.\]*

*\[A large group of east end punks hustle over to the stage from the bar area.\]*

**YER OFF TO UNIVERSITY TO LEARN HOW TO WIELD POWER**

**I’LL BE THERE ON ME HANDS AND KNEES, GOT LOOS TO FOKING SCOUR**

*\[DICKIE is suddenly a man possessed, all kinetic/frenetic energy. His head*

*and torso jerk rhythmically to the beat  in a manner almost seizure-like.\]*

*\[The chorus comes blistering in as a small mosh pic ignites\]*

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

*pit expands and swallows ANNA REXEK before she can react.\]*

**ON HORSEBACK FER A FOXHUNT AT YER HOLIDAY CHATEAU**

**GOT A DUMPSTER, RATS AND ROACHES IN MY ALLEY BUNGALOW**

*\[The stage is overrun by several wild-eyed punks who prowl back and forth, elbows*

*flying, before diving into the crowd.\]*

**YER THE PRODUCT OF A LOFTY EGG AND A SQUIRT O’ NOBLE JISM**

**I’M THE STAIN ON THE FOKING SHEET OF THE BRITISH CASTE SYSTEM**

*\[DICKIE kneels at the stage edge as a dozen eastenders clamor to sing along.\]*

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

*\[STEWART FILTH sends a beer can sailing off the stage with his left foot and*

*without missing a beat goes right into a blistering lead.\]*

\[DICKIE is several feet above the crowd and a flood of adrenaline kills every sound

in the universe. Through the smoke he makes out a roiling wave of mohawks beneath

him. A flashbulb goes off and the glorious music returns, louder than ever before. He

tucks into a somersault and is falling now into a sea of outstretched arms.\]

[MF] Dickie's Revenge *“What can you tell me ‘bout your death, Mr. Dickinson?”* The clerk suppressed a yawn as she pored over the processee’s file.

*“A mistake’s been made, mis’ess!”* The dazed man implored*. “Ask me mates! Weez out gallivantin’ not five minutes ‘go. I’m right as rain!”*

*“Feel for your pulse if you like, laddie.”*

The man shot upright, his hands moving in a flurry from wrist to neck and back to wrist. *“Bloody hell!”* he cried out. *“Et can’t be!””*

*“Terribly sorry”* the clerk’s voice droned from behind the file folder. *“What can ya tell me ‘bout your death, then?”*

*“Not a goddamn t’ing!”* The man’s voice cracked with panic. *“One second I’m raisin’ hell wit’ the boys and next t’ing ya know I’m flyin’ like Cap’n Britain through a bloody tunnel o’ light.”*

*“But no memory of a bus?”*

*“Wotz that s’posed t’mean?”*

*“There was an accident at the intersection of Wembley South and Northhamptonshire involvin’ an inebriated pedestrian and a double-decker bus.”*

*“Yer not sayin’ that plonker’s me?!”*

*“‘Fraid that’s the gist of it, son.”*

*“Bugger me sideways!”* Dickie cried out. *“I’m only nineteen!”*

The clerk raised both hands to adjust the listing mass of her beehive hair.

*“Yer pos’tive et sez ize ran ov’r by a bus?”*

*“A double decker bus, yes.”*

*“Crikey Moses!” He moaned. “The Soho sods ‘r ‘avin’ a foking laff!”*

*“Language please, Mr. Dickinson.”*

*“It’s Dickie for chrissake.”*

*“Right. Dickie then. Tell me about this evening.”* The clerk raised her bifocals to the overhead fluorescent lights in search of a smudge.

*“Well we woz at Dingwall’s t’see ‘Ian and the Shits’ play. I r’member that. Oh ‘n whilz we woz bladderin’ up at the bar thes fucknugget Duncan starts yappin’ out ez arse ‘bout ‘ow eez jes seen Lemmy at a pub en King’s Cross. We legged et like billy-o t’see fer areself.”*

*“And so ya connected with your mate in King’s Cross?”*

*“Which mate’s that?”*

*“This Lenny feller ya just mentioned.”*

*“LEMMY FROM MOTORHEAD, NUMPTY!”*

A mustachioed clerk with a thick French accent whispered emphatically “Monsieur, please!” through the plastic leaves of a decorative plastic tree separating the two desks and pointed to the “QUIET VOICES QUIET TRAILS” sign hanging from an electrical pipe in the open ceiling. On the other side of the desk from the man sat a young girl of six with green sunken eyes that presently were fixed on the majestic spikes of Dickie’s mohawk.

“*BUGGER OFF YA CHEESE-EATING SURRENDER MONKEY!“* Dickie barked reflexively at the man. He then turned calmly to the female clerk across from him and whispered*: “What’s the little girl doin’ en thes place?”*

*“Bein’ processed like you ‘n ev’ry other soul ‘ere.”* The clerk replied blandly.

*“Well that’s bloody awful.”*

Dickie turned to the girl. *“Hiya. Like me hairdo?”*

The girl stared back wide-eyed.

*“What they call ya?” Dickie asked softly.*

*“Elizabeth”* she whispered with nary a sound.

“*Busy busy!*” The clerk interrupted. “Ya recall makin’ it to the pub in King’s Cross?”

*“Good to know ya Elizabeth.”* Dickie looked into the frightened girl’s eyes and lingered there momentarily.

*“Mr. Dick…..Dickie rather....I must ask you to stay focused. Did you get to your destination?”*

*“Yeah. Lemmy wuddn’t there o’course. Ask’d some piss-artist playin’ darts eff eed been en. Bloke nearly coff’d iz shrivel’d liver up laffin’. Bollocking cockwomble Duncan.”*

*“Is that yer last recollection?”*

*“Last t’ing I r’member ez chattin’ up a tasty trollop out front. Had ‘er a pair o’ strawberry creams,*

*Lordy McGee.”*

*“Focus lad.”*

*“So a git rozzer shows up jes then wavin’ iz dildo in our face sayin’ scram or get charged with loiterin’ so off we went.”*

*“And all blank after that is it?”*

*“S’pose. Doze et say any’ting on that paper ‘bout the maniac who kilt me? Musta been a reddie he run wot took me out.”*

As if on cue the clerk began to read in monotone*: “The victim was in the centre of the road shaking his bare hindquarters at the 12-tonne vehicle just prior to impact.”*

*“O fer fucksake!”* Dickie wailed. *“Etz werse now, innit!?”*

*“I’ll ask one last time. Very important.”* The clerk’s voice was momentarily emotive. *“Nothing we’ve spoken ‘bout’s jogged your memory of the accident itself?”*

*“Naw we wuz legless from the rum by then, missie. Why ask anyway?”*

*“Dark thoughts dark trails, lad. Memories of that nature are terribly dangerous in this place. Need to be handled with care. Few more questions. Your parents alive?”*

*“Me mum’s dead.”*

*“That recent?”*

*“Naw ize ‘er age.”* He replied with a nod to Elizabeth*.*

*“Close were ya?”*

*“Can’t say.”*

*“Father?”*

*“Jailbird, hope to christ eez dead.”*

*“Siblings?”*

*“Steppie, complete ‘n utter wankstain.”*

*“Alive?”*

*“No earthly idea.”*

*“Other family?”*

*“Gotta git fer an uncle, useless.”*

*“Ya married?”*

*“Funny.”*

*“Children?”*

*“COME ON NOW!”*

The clerk checked boxes up and down a form while humming several octaves off-key to muzak playing throughout the facility. She then closed the file and extended a limp hand across her desk. *“Been a pleasure in a way. There’s a lift down the hall. Take that to first level, out the front, follow signs to Script Development, building 9, take this notice, good luck t’ya. Next!”*

Dickie stood, flashed a smile in Elizabeth’s direction and glanced down at the notice.

&amp;#x200B;

***Welcome to The Processing Center.***

***Regrettably you are dead. All deaths are final. This is not a verdict or judgement. It is an organic fact.***

***We are here to facilitate your send off. All that is required of you is to reflect on your existence and select a brief joyous memory to accompany you into the afterlife.***

***The Staff of Processing Center 891D229VE4.***

&amp;#x200B;

In the lift alongside Dickie was an older man outfitted in a tuxedo and red velvet bowler hat.

*“Press ‘1’ there chap if you would. Cheers. Bertram Plank from Knightsbridge. You are?”*

*“Dickie.”*

*“Quite an evening we’re having, Dickie.”*

*“How’s a rich toff like you give up the ghost?”*

*“Massive heart attack at the Duke of Fife’s dinner party. Put a damper on dessert service I imagine. Poor dear Maggie my wife.”*

*“Hard cheese there, mate.”*

*“Don’t mean to cry on your shoulder. What brings you here, son?”*

*“Bus run me ov’r.”*

The man offered a polite chuckle and patted Dickie on the shoulder.*“Truthfully son, what was it?”*

The windowless concrete structure the two processees emerged from resembled a drab tenement block. Both men noticed a peculiar quality to the outside light which seemed to lack warmth or any discernible source.

They made their way across a sprawling faux lawn on a path that meandered downhill toward a towering billboard featuring an illustrated woman straight out of a ‘50’s Coca-Cola ad, hand cupped over her mouth and the words “JOYOUS THOUGHTS JOYOUS TRAILS” filling a large speech bubble. Beyond that was the first of what appeared to be giant hangars stretching into the distance.

As they drew closer it became apparent that the purpose of the hangars was for the building of sets and the atmosphere was that of a bustling studio lot. All around them creations were at various stages of development: a replica of Britain’s WW2 Spitfire fighter plane; the facade of a Victorian country manor; a painted backdrop depicting the white cliffs of Dover; the Terracotta-tiled courtyard of a French cafe and most notably, what must have been a forty foot facsimile of a carnival ferris wheel surrounded by scaffolding.

Dickie and Bertram walked wide-eyed down the narrow dirt road taking in the images. Just beyond the final hangar a sign reading “Script Development” pointed to another nondescript concrete structure where dozens of processees stood in front waiting for their names to be called.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“Ev’r see The Sex Pistols?”* The Scriptwriter asked with his head buried in Dickie’s file.

*“Course I seen The Pistols. Bummed a fag off Vicious last year en Bethnal Green.”*

*“Worst musician ‘n rock ‘n roll hist’ry.”*

*“Didn’t matter diddit?”* Dickie snapped back.

*“That’s right, cuz iz amp’s a prop. Nev’r been plugged en. Bloke’s a circus monkey.”*

*“Seen ‘em play ‘ave ya?”*

*“Once. Queensway Hall in Dunstable.”*

*“Good, yeah?”*

The Scriptwriter’s head sprang up as if stirred from a dream.

*“They opened wit’ Anarchy. The dog’s bollocks mate! Bodies flyin’ ev’ry which way. Ize head ov’r arse ‘n starkers ‘fore Rotten sang a word. Thought ize a gon’r!”*

*“Did’ya ‘ave that same spod haircut then?”* Dickie asked with a grin.

*“Naw - it wuz bleached out, quite a mane.”* The Scriptwriter’s attention returned to the paperwork*. “Nev’r had the knackers t’spike m’self up.”*

*“The Ramones ‘r playin’ Aylesbury next week Friday. Foking kilz me t’be tits up fer that.”*

*“Speakin’ ‘o which, we’d best get goin’, schedules run tight ‘round ‘ere.”*

*“Up t’you.”*

*“I’m Fergus Smythe, sixth generation east ender, earned a livin’ writin’ telly adverts, OD’d on dope en a condemned shithole two blocks from where me wife ‘n nine month old girl were waitin’ fer me, dinner on the table. Eva and Charlotte. Me inna nutshell.”*

*“That cheered me up.”*

*“Yer turn.”*

*“Namez Dickie, got hit by a foking bus, letz see, unemployed, work’d on the hobble tho paintin’ ov’r graffiti, wot elz, ize singer in a band called The Royal Butt Plugz, ya might’a known us as The RBPz.”*  Dickie glanced up for an acknowledgment that was not forthcoming. *“They’ll need a new frontman now.”*

*“East Ender?”*

*“That’s right. Tower Hamlets ‘riginally. Been livin’ on the streets tho en Peckham since me cocksplat fotter went off t’jail.”*

*“Thatz a start. Read the notice, did’ya?*

*“Yeah I read that tosh.Yer foking dead as a doornail so shut the fuck up. And while yer at et think up a cheery mem’ry. Batshit.”*

*“Batshitz the only constant, mate.”* The Scriptwriter smiled and stretched his spindly legs onto the metal desk before him*. “How ‘bout life? Ya get yanked outta sweet nothingness onto a rock spinnin’ round a blindin’ ball o’ fire thatz hurtlin’ thru space a million miles an hour t’ward a monster hole that wolfs down stars like foking bisquits. And ya think thes ez strange?”*

Dickie sat motionless, his brown eyes fixed on the carpeted floor. A distant muted thrum from the nearby hangars was all that could be heard.

*“Wanted t‘ave me a tee-shirt shoppe someday.”* He said solemnly.

*“Yeah?”*

*“‘Dickie’s Shirts &amp; Shite’. Make me own designs ‘sted ‘o pawnin’ the same rubbish y’see ev’ry stinkin’ place.”*

The Scriptwriter listened without comment.

*I done thes one ‘ere.”* He unzipped his stud-covered biker jacket to reveal a silk-screened drawing of a crowned buttocks covered with pimples and a large cherry-red plug inserted therein. Above it was a stylistic script that read *The RBPz*. “People stop me on the street to ‘ave a look.”

The Scriptwriter laughed*. “I’d buy that shirt!”*

*“‘Cept fer yer dead.”*

*“As a doornail, yep.”*

Suddenly the room was enveloped in a profound silence. Dickie twirled a chain that hung off a belt loop of his ripped jeans and the Scriptwriter scribbled notes in red ink until the frenetic movement of his hand stopped all at once. He took aim at the wastebasket and let his pen fly end over end, barely missing.

*“Thes place ez hell, innit?”* Dickie asked finally. “*Say et straight up.”*

*“Thought the same t’ing. Figur’d where elz wud a good fer nothin’ baghead go?”*

*“Ya didn’t answer me question.”*

*“Thes place id’nt hell I don’t t’ink. Eff ya don’t gev a fuck et might az well be tho cuz yull bodge yer one shot for cloud nine, yeah. Eternity’s quite a stretch, mate. Who knows eff yull ev’r get yanked out of et again. Two choices: send off en a bloody state o’ rapture or throw a spanner in the works.”*

*“Why ez et yer not bloody sent off yet?”*

*“I wud’nt retty. Still might not be. Ev’ry bloke ya see workin’ ‘ere’s the same. Done four scripts, yer the fifth. Five more after that and I go, end ‘o story.”*

Dickie stared for a long while at a mural painted on the far wall that read “HAPPY THOUGHTS HAPPY TRAILS”, his head shaking almost imperceptibly. *“Complete batshit.”* he mumbled at last.

The Scriptwriter swung his legs off the desk*. “Letz get started.”*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the edge of a reflecting pool dozens of processees stood statue-like gazing into the still black water that gave no reflection in return. On a bench along the perimeter, underneath the fissured columns of a decrepit arcade, Dickie sat next to the young girl he had met during his first moments at the Processing Center. It was something akin to dusk and the odd light drained quickly leaving a grainy brume hanging over the scene.

*“Been ok ‘ave ya?”* Dickie asked Elizabeth.

The girl nodded. “*I’m not even hungry or tired*.”

*“Can I call ya Lizzie?”*

*“That’s what my Auntie Kate calls me.”*

*“Had me a girlfriend once went by Lizzie.”*

*“Was she nice?”*

*“Jeezus no, mean as a rat.”*

*“Does she know you died?”*

*“Good question. No idea really.”*

*“How did you die?”*

Dickie sighed*. “Ya know them big red city buses?”*

The girl nodded.

“*One uv em run me ov’r.”*

“*Did you look both ways ‘fore ya crossed the street*?” Her voice was full of concern.

“*Must not ‘ave. What happened wit’ you*?”

“*My blood got sick*.”

“*Ah, sorry there Lizzie.”* Dickie fished inside his jacket pocket. *“Ya ev’r seen one o’ these?*”

*“Is it money?”*

“*From the States, yep. Called a quarter. You can ‘ave et*.”

*“Thank you.*” She brought the coin close to her eyes. “*Who’s that man?*”

“*Couldn’t tell ya. Abe Lincoln maybe. Shoulda paid more ‘tention en skool*.”

“*I like his funny hair.*”

“*That bloke’s wearin’ a wig - thes ‘ere’s real!”* he said proudly, bowing his head to the girl. “*Can I ask ya a question?”*

“*Yes.”*

*“Yer not ‘fraid ‘r ya?”*

*“Yes.”*

*“Wutcha talk t’yer writer, ‘bout?”*

*“Mum and Dad and Colin.”*

*“Ez Colin yer brother?”*

Elizabeth nodded. *“He’s just two.”*

*“That’s nice. Yull be wit’ ‘im soon, yeah?”*

Elizabeth looked down and began to weep tearlessly.

*“I’m sorry now. Why ya cryin’?”* Dickie patted the girl awkwardly on her head.

*“I want to be with Colin. But I don’t want him to die like me.”*

*“No no...etz not that way! Not that way a’tall! He’ll be inside yer heart ‘n soul, like.”* Dickie brought both hands to his chest. *“You’ll be together, yer whole fam’ly. Etz batshit I know...sorry there, I mean et don’t make no sense, but I swear t’Christ hisself noone’s gonna die.”*

Elizabeth buried her face in the sleeves of her dress. *“I don’t want him to ever get sick.”*

*“Lemme tellya - Colinz gonna live t’be an ole codger. Betcha a million quid!”*

Dickie reached out and shook the girl’s hand.

*“Will you be with your family too?”* Elizabeth asked.

*“Naw, that’s...I’m not lucky like you. But Fergus me writer, heez a gud egg, I like wot he done. He won’t cock-up me send-off…mean to say I trust the bloke.”*

*“I want to hug my family and never let go.”* Elizabeth whispered through sobs.

*“Soon, Lizzie, soon.”*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“GORDON FOKING BENNETT!* Dickie shouted.

He had blinked awake and was moving in near total darkness down a cobblestoned promenade lined with Elizabethan playhouses on both sides, one after the other, each indistinguishable from the next except for the titles on the marquee signs that shone like neon beacons in the night. The atmosphere was festive and a crowd of revelers merrily came and went from theater to theater, the barren sky above them animated with spotlights.

A smiling man approached who Dickie immediately recognized as the French clerk from the Processing Center. *“Pardon me”* he said as he handed Dickie a playbill, pointing across the way from where they were standing. *“You’re at The Globe, four theaters down.”*

*“Wotz that now?”* Dickie asked.

*“Your send-off, Mr. Dickinson.”*

*“Huh? Oh. Right.”*

As the man walked away Dickie yelled out *“Sorry fer what I called ya, mate. Frenchies are ok by me!”* The clerk turned and called out: *“Happy trails young man!”*

There were six plays listed on the bill:

“A Picnic in Giverny” Starring Joan Birdwhistell

“Bye Bye Jerry: Nightfight Over Hamburg” Starring Nigel Pinfield

“Colin’s First Christmas” Starring Elizabeth Walsh

“Dickie’s Revenge” Starring Alex Dickinson

“Kilimanjaro” Starring Bertram Plank

“World’s Faire 1946: A Proposal” Starring Imogen Cromley

As he made his way through the crowd toward The Globe a great ovation rose up from within the Blackfriars Theater where “Colin’s First Christmas” had just ended. Moments later the front doors opened and audience members filed out into a narrow stone portico, many of them smiling, others looking visibly moved.

“Cheerio sweet Lizzie” Dickie whispered to himself.

Upon seeing his name in lights a nervous shudder rattled from some sentient place still awake inside him. Images swirled like dust in a vortex. He saw his mother’s face in a wash of fall sunshine; his childhood cat “Jack the Ripper” staring down from the cardboard roof of the boys-only fort he’d fashioned out of junkyard bricks; Davey - his best friend from elementary school on the day he moved away to Liverpool, waving goodbye in the pouring rain; the Brixton girl’s face just before he kissed her inside a red telephone kiosk across the street from Rough Trade Records.

Just then all of The Globe’s house lights switched on and the entrance doors swung open.

Interior: A seedy nightclub veiled by a thick fog

of clove cigarette smoke. The crowd is mostly teens

outfitted in full punk regalia. The stage is raised several

feet off a sticky floor coated by a permanent veneer of

spilled lager. A spinning disco ball hanging over the drum

kit provides the only stagelight.

*in unison from behind the black curtain onto the stage. Their entrance goes almost*

*completely unnoticed by the crowd.\]*

*\[As the band gets situated and tuned, ANNA REXEK appears at the foot of the stage.\]*

ANNA REXEK: Well thes ez awkward innit? I seez ya got a new player. Wot ‘appened t’the acne-faced lad? Embarked on a solo career az he?

DICKIE: \[Facing away from the crowd, he lets out a primal scream:\] I’M A CITY SLAVE!!!

*\[SCURVY and DANNY BOY pounce and all eyes in the club are on the band. The riff is*

*undeniably catchy and full of raw, manic intensity.\]*

**I SEE YER LOOKIN’ EDGY IN THE LATEST PUNK ROCK FASHION**

**YER OFF TO UNIVERSITY TO LEARN HOW TO WIELD POWER**

**I’LL BE THERE ON ME HANDS AND KNEES, GOT LOOS TO FOKING SCOUR**

*\[DICKIE is suddenly a man possessed, all kinetic/frenetic energy. His head*

*and torso jerk rhythmically to the beat  in a manner almost seizure-like.\]*

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

**ON HORSEBACK FER A FOXHUNT AT YER HOLIDAY CHATEAU**

**GOT A DUMPSTER, RATS AND ROACHES IN MY ALLEY BUNGALOW**

*\[The stage is overrun by several wild-eyed punks who prowl back and forth, elbows*

*flying, before diving into the crowd.\]*

**YER THE PRODUCT OF A LOFTY EGG AND A SQUIRT O’ NOBLE JISM**

**I’M THE STAIN ON THE FOKING SHEET OF THE BRITISH CASTE SYSTEM**

*\[DICKIE kneels at the stage edge as a dozen eastenders clamor to sing along.\]*

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

**I’M A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE A CITY SLAVE \[Backing vocals\] MY BIRTHRIGHT!**

*\[STEWART FILTH sends a beer can sailing off the stage with his left foot and*

*without missing a beat goes right into a blistering lead.\]*

\[DICKIE is several feet above the crowd and a flood of adrenaline kills every sound

in the universe. Through the smoke he makes out a roiling wave of mohawks beneath

him. A flashbulb goes off and the glorious music returns, louder than ever before. He

tucks into a somersault and is falling now into a sea of outstretched arms.\]

Acceleration hesitation at 2000 RPM in a 1997? Hey y'all, wondering if you've ever experienced a hesitation to accelerate specifically in areas between 2000-3000 rpm in 2nd-4th in a 1.8 NA?

This is a relatively new issue for my miata, not sure what could've led to it. Being the cheapest thing to replace, I tried swapping the TPS sensor, but no dice. I know it probably has something to do with one of the sensors since it always lags in one specific part of the powerband and only if I'm half-WOT throttle (if I baby it, no hesitation). Feels kind of jerky like a bad shift for a moment each time I hit a "weird" area of that RPM curve.

Thoughts?

Shifting.... Have I been doing it wrong? I've been reading countless internet forums and I see so many people who are saying not only can you shift a bike WOT.... (which I already do by blipping the clutch)... But that you can shift it WOT without using the clutch. At all.


Have I been shifting all wrong all my life? I have never shifted up nor down without putting in my clutch. I've been shifting while having the throttle pinned for years now but clutchlessly? Can someone clue me in? This sounds like a bad idea to me.

Another Day (the one with raw power) Automotive technician: A Day of True Power

They say, “there is no replacement for displacement.”

I have driven fast vehicles in my life. Very fast vehicles. From Subaru STI, to Mercedes Benz SLS AMG, to a true ‘Fast and Furious’ set vehicle. I have never, and will likely never, drive another vehicle that was this fast. I don’t know if I want to.

Disclaimer: I’m not a ‘go fast’ driver. However if a client says, “hit it...” oh, I will not hesitate to open a vehicle up to see what it’s about. Only if the client gives the go ahead.

I was asked to drive a client home in his own vehicle. A 68’ Mercury Cougar, all glass replaced by plexiglass, full cage, super slicks over sized on the rear and a blower towering through a fiberglass hood. Weight reduction was taken in grams as interior paint was buffed out, and the bare steel was clear coated. The vehicle ‘lopped’, it did not idle. The smell of racing fuel saturated the air, stinging nostrils that dared to approach.

He drove to his residence, there was no conversation over the earth shattering noise. He ‘blurped’ the throttle once on our way. It was impressive. He looked over at me like, “fucking cool, man!” His face resembled Jack Nicholson’s, “HERES JOHNNY!” I nodded and smiled back to symbolize I was impressed.

We pulled up to his residence and I jumped out, wiggling my jaw, trying to get my ears to pop. We met in front of the vehicle and he handed me the keys, “This thing is pretty cool, huh?” “Yea. Buy it as is?” “For the most part. I have done a bit of reinforcing to keep the torque from ripping the frame apart.” “Cool, man well, we will give you a call when we are done with it.” “Oh, do me a favor on your way back to the shop, open it up. Be careful, but you have to feel the power this beauty creates.”  “Yea, thanks for the offer, but no.” “Oh come on man, I trust you. You’ve got to.” “Okay, Okay,” I said just to end the conversation.

I jumped in and made my way through his suburb and reached the main road. I had no ambition to test this vehicle’s power. “... but he did give me permission,” I thought to myself. I stoped at a red light. No one was around. “Fuck it...” I had my left foot slammed with all my strength on to the brake pedal, my right was holding the gas at about 1,800RPM.

The light turned green. I would hold the gas pedal to the ground for three seconds. As I tell this experience remember.... three seconds...

Instantly I felt inner ear damage. The rear tires started to burn as they twisted to near tearing limit. The smell of burning rubber instantly filled the air. I started to fight the steering wheel as the vehicle started to walk itself into the left lane. My attempts to keep the vehicle facing straight was so physically demanding my abs and back muscles started to kick in to help my arms fight the wheel. I was instantly regretting my choice, but I had committed, I had to follow through.

The tires grabbed hold of the road and the front end was thrown into the air. The entire vehicle twisted under the power, like a torsion bar. I couldn’t see anything except for the hood and blower assembly. They stared at me, reminding me of how horrible of an idea I had made. The instant G-forces made me sick to my stomach immediately. The blood rushed to the back portion of my body making me light headed. My hands where being pulled away from the steering wheel as every one of my muscle fibers strained to keep my hands holding the wheel.

The front end slammed to the ground. I saw that I was making my way into the center turn lane. The steering wheel became squirrelly. The vehicle did micro-zigzags as the front end made contact with the earth. I was somewhere between terrified and a erection. My head hurt and my muscles ached. The earth around me was a blur. Time and space became abstract. My ‘oh shit face’ had to be of epic proportions.

I released the gas pedal and made my way back into my lane. I looked at the speedometer as I slowed the vehicle down. 125mph. “Holy fuck!” My adrenaline kicked in and my heart jumped up to my throat. It would be an hour before my adrenaline would die down.

Some of you may be thinking, “125mph? Whatever! That’s not fast!” No you would be right I happen to be part of the ‘200 club’ myself. However, 125mph in about 2.4 seconds, is on a whole other level. It is like nothing that I could ever truly explain to someone. It’s erotic, and sexy, and beautiful.... ITS FUCKING TERRIFYING!

I made it back to the shop safely and had to sit down for a few minutes before getting back to my own work. Another technician worked on the vehicle. I never saw the vehicle or the client again.

Anyone that says drag racing is not real racing... let’s see if you could do it. Another second of WOT, I shiver to think.

Luck and patience ....... I spent all weekend in the hot sun in my area looking for queens and scanning the pavement didn't see a single queen .....

I really wanted to find a queen so bad and gave up on Sunday.

Tuesday rolled around ( Today ) and it was a beautiful sunny day so i grabbed an ice drink and sat on the porch or a nearby warehouse and sat down , 20 minutes later a queen crawls out of the door way and looks like its about to fly and i knew it probably wasn't fertilised so i watched it fly away .Was nice to see it though.

&amp;#x200B;

20 minutes after that one flew back and landed and a male was on the back sealing the deal WOT .

I look around for a test tube , realise im at work and dont have anything .

Watched her clean herself and crawl into a crack ......

Mechanical Question: odd engine sound Background: car went in for 60k maintenance interval, differential service, throttle body and injector clean, rear brake pads and rotors re-surfaced.

Problem: rough idle and squeaking/chirping sound at idle, while slowing down, under 2k RPM, slow speeds (below 35 mph).  Squeaking/chirping sound absolves with throttle application.  Sound is not present at WOT, at speeds over 60 mph.  Sound only happens after car is warm (usually after about 20 minutes of driving), but happens consistently.  This sound and rough idle started after 60k maintenance visit (same day as pick up).

Any ideas?  I've read sometimes engines can run rough after injector clean/throttle body clean.  could it be the spark plugs?  Any input would be appreciated, thanks!

Helicopter mom asks for constant update, gets it TL;DR at the bottom;

Sorry for the huge WoT and any grammar/spelling mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

**HUGE WALL OF CONTEXT**

I come from a country where moms are overprotective and criminality is not negligible (Not as safe as Japan, but also not war territory either, 3rd world issues).

I still lived with my parents at the time (i was 18ish) because we could not afford me moving out for college, so I would go to college everyday by car.

I had a car of my own, it was more than 10 years old back then but 'twas well taken care of; it was nearly a necessity having a car where I lived (not having to take the bus was a huge plus, no trains/subway over there).

My daily routine would consist of driving to the campus, classes, internship and gym, all which were in the campus' vicinity.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 3 years and I was in my last years of college/university and I could afford (with moms help and my part-time job) to finally replace my old faithful companion.

We managed to get a good second-hand car from an acquaintance and she agreed that i would pick up the car at a dealership (the details are not relevant).

On the day itself, i show up, get the keys and documents, everything is ok, I call my overprotective mom and let her know it's all good.

I do the usual route after, classes, internship and gym. But because i had to do extra car stuff, I was a little late on my schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time i leave the gym, it was already 8-9ish pm and i noticed that my phone was on top of my wallet, where one of my badges (probably internal university's id or something) triggered the NFCwhatever on the phone over and over, causing the battery to dry completely.

&amp;#x200B;

No biggie right ? Here comes the second part of the huge wall of context with another key info:

My mom had her car stolen, at gun point (something very, very uncommon in our city) a couple of years before that, and since then, she was a bit paranoid with the whole driving-alone-after-7-8pm-thing,

asking me and my sister to always reply SMS and/or pick up the phone/call back within 30 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get home, I see my mom, my dad and my sister all waiting for me in the living room, with their faces representing a mix between relief and WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU, YOU SON OF A \*\*\*\*\*\*

I get my ass chewed hard by my mom, because I (supposedly) turned my phone off on purpose and she thought that I was kidnapped with the new (second-hand) car.

She called the university, their security department, the police, a couple of friends of mine and the gym (the person working at the front-desk also made sure to tell my mom "I didn't see him here today").

yadayadayada, she made me promise that i would tell her whenever I'd leave the gym, class or any other place that i might be late home.

&amp;#x200B;

**HERE IS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR, THE MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE**

I said ok, if that's what she wants, shes getting it. My dad, in a mix of "do as your mom says" and "its not really my problem" agreed with her.

Smartphones were a thing, and so was an app fresh out of the oven called *Tasker*.

I used tasker for little things like, switching to silent mode when inside the campus, switching on and off all kinds of stuff you can imagine based on time/place/battery level, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

You can already imagine where this is going right? Yes, i added a few extra rules that would send an SMS every time i would go in or out of one of those areas. To all my family members.

Enters gym, SMS mom, dad,sister "Im at the gym". Out of the gym SMS mom, dad, sister "Im out of the gym", for all the locations i mentioned previously (campus/classes, internship, gym and home).

&amp;#x200B;

An important detail is that sometimes the phone's GPS signal jitters/wobbles a little, so the texts would be sent sometimes 2-5 times per location as the phone's location would alternate between in and out of the specified areas.

&amp;#x200B;

After 5 minutes my sister texted me back: "Please stop, i get your point".

After half an hour, my dad texts me back: "I am at work, can you please stop texting me all the time, just text your mom"

Two hours later (not following the 30min rule btw), my mom replies (thinking it was not an automated message): "Hi son, thanks for letting me know, xoxo, mom"

&amp;#x200B;

On the second day my mom figured it was an automatic system in place, and after seven days she also got tired of it and just asked me to inform her whenever something extraordinary happened instead.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Freshman me living with parents got ass chewed by overprotective mom for not picking up the phone the day i got a new(ish) car, developed flow with Tasker to spam her with SMS with my location.**

Today is Day 1 Hi all, I’ve been struggling with sexual problems my entire life. I’m 29 now, and it’s ruining my life. Literally everything negative in my life is tied to my sexual problems and mental issues that accompany it.

Basically I’ve always had addiction issues. When I was a kid masturbation and shame about being gay were constant thoughts. I covered up those feelings with drugs and alcohol. I eventually found recovery from drugs and alcohol at age 20, and my life got so much more manageable in all avenues besides sex.

I began to have sex more often, almost always closeted and semi anonymous. I love (d) the chase much more than the act itself. I could spend hours edging, chatting with men and fantasizing about having sex. Trading pics and validation was huge parts of it as well. Whenever I did act out, I was consumed by fear and guilt for days...

A few years ago I met a great guy and thought I found the one. I was feeling comfortable being gay, I thought my lack of acceptance was my main issue. I know gay guys who have sex and don’t let it destroy them, I am also an anorexic when it comes to sex. I’m not sex positive at all. With my new BF I was enjoying sex and enjoying my relationship, however I would still chat up other men and edge and lose myself in fantasy. I would occasionally meet up with a guy and engage in low risk sexual activities like JO and oral. I ended up having an outbreak of HSV 1 (mouth herpes) and it really destroyed me mentally. I became sexually anorexic with my BF, wanting to swear off sexual but still edging and chasing guys online...occasionally acting out with oral/JO.

I live a double life. My partner and I are long distance. I talk about my values and how I detest random or risky sex, yet I still give in to temptation and JO do oral wot other guys. I worry for days after about herpes and other STIs.

I’m in therapy now for diagnosed OCD related to my fear of contamination, and self loathing. I cut all meet from my diet years ago, managed to quit Soda and smoking. I cut more things from my life trying to be better and healthier, but this is destroying me...I can’t get my sex problems under control.

I attended a telephone S.A.A. meeting this morning and that was great. I plan to attend a SAA meeting this evening and know this will be a rough few days. I’m currently dealing with burning skin and terrible anxiety about engaging in oral sex this weekend. I just wish I could sober...

I’m just desperate for relief, my self loathing is out of control and I’m barely functioning. I’m glad to be here though.

"Follow the visual to perfection or i'm calling our manager!" Ok have it your way. WoT incoming TL;DR at bottom.

Now for a background I had this annoying girl at work who got promoted to key holder her first day (I had been at this location for 7 months at that time) anyways visual day rolls around (that's when we make the store look nice with signs and mannequins). She gets super bossy about how we have to follow the visuals to perfection because our manager said so (she didn't). I said thats what I do.

Now here's the kicker: our store is smaller than the stores they have in the visual (we only do mens clothing while every other store sells womens on top of the men's stuff).

I point this small yet crucial detail and she yells at me: "Follow the visual to perfection or I'm calling Gwen!" (Please note this is a fake name).

I say: "Ok fine have it your way!" so I set off to do the best I could and I come up to a small problem the wall that they want the stuff on is angled 90 degrees and little Miss perfect is breathing down my neck.

 I saved that wall until she was gone on break and did my best with it now there is a large $20 sign that is supposed to go in the middle of this wall so I being the cheeky good employee I am put this sign right dead smack in the middle of the wall space having at an angle between the two 90 degree shelves. She of course comes back and had a fit for what I think looks rather nice and calls Gwen.

Gwen was in a meeting with visual leader at the time so both came down unbenonced to me and when they saw they angled sign they actually congratulated me for putting the sign that way as it was creative and made the corner look better than it did on that visual wall.

So suck it crazy girl the bossed me around for too long now i'm the keyholder and you got arrested!

TL;DR: crazy coworker bossed me around eveb though I was doing my job and when she complained about it not being perfect they instead congratulated me for being creative.

Bike still not turning on! 08 hyosung gt250r still won’t turn on! I have cleaned the carbs 2x at this point and added new spark plugs. The only way this bike will turn on is if carb cleaner is used as starter fluid. When it turns on with the carb cleaner it revs to WOT and then dies quickly. I’m not sure if my bike has a air/fuel mixture screw because I couldn’t find it but all of the jets are clean. The air box is hard to get back on and I took 30 minutes making sure that the air box and carbs themselves were placed and sealed on correctly since they’re hard to put on so I doubt there is an vacuum leak in these areas. I’m not sure what else to try? I’m seriously considering selling the bike at this point even tho I can’t afford a running bike.

WoT Rant: Nmom's parenting tactics I didn't realize were abusive until 20 I'm a long-time silent scroller, first time poster.

It wasn't until this sub that I really felt likepeople understood where I was coming from. It's nice to see people who actually support going NC. Please excuse any grammar/spelling mistakes

Tl:DR &amp; question at bottom

Rant

TW: Sexual Abuse

When I was 6, I remember getting into a bit of a tussle with another girl on the playground. She initiated it, but I was bigger and stronger, so I came out just fine, but she had some scrapes and brusies. I got home (I walked because we lived so close), and went to my bedroom. Nmom came in, sat on the bed like she was calm. I thought she going to talk to me about what happened. Instead, the next thing I know, she's got a grip on my arm, and she's slamming me to the floor and then back onto the bed. I don't really recall what happened afterwards.  Later that year, the apartment we lived in developed mold, so my grandmother moved us into a different apartment. We were only there for a few months, but while we were there, I was having some trouble in school (not severe, we had that stupid color system and I was on yellow for like 3 days in a row). Well, at the end of the week, she decides to bag up everything in my room except my bed, a night stand, a lamp,7 school outfits, 3-4 sets of pajamas, and like 3-4 non-school outfits.


When I was 8, I moved in with my dad and Nstepmom because I thought the grass was greener. Wrong. The babysitter taught me the word "cock." I was 8.  I didn't understand it was a curse word. I used that word in a Yo Mama joke. Nstepmom doesn't say anything about it. I go back to Nmom's for visitation (every other weekend), and she nearly broke my ankle beating me for it. She didn't believe that I didn't understand the word.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 9, Nmom married my stepdad, gave birth to my baby brother, and then promptly (and without telling my bio dad) moved me 400 miles away from all my friends and family. I was always a bit of a loner in the sense that I spent a lot of time alone in my room. I was used to only living with her, and she worked a lot and I went to an afterschool program. I don't quite remember what I did to make her upset, but not only did she again get rid of everything except my bed furinture and some clothes, she gave away my entire book collection to some girl I'd met once who destroyed everything she touched. I thought that was the worst day of my life. I used to stay up at night and hide under my covers with a flashlight to read those books over andover and over again. To know not only were they being taken but that they probably wouldn't surivie with the heathen that was getting them just made me absolutely enragaed.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 12, I was sexually abused by (what I thought was) a dear friend in neighbour (not going into detail to spare you the reading effort). I didn't tell my nmom for what felt like years (in reality it was 3-4 months). But I didn't directly tell her. I was at school, and I just had this unexplainable wave of sadness and broke down in band class. They ushered me into the guidance couselors office ( I visited her on a daily/bi-daily basis. We'll call her Ms.F). I told her what happened, and that I was afraid to tell Nmom because I thought she'd tell me it was my fault. She told me that she had to because it was the law. Ms.F drove me home after I calmed down. When I sat down in the living room, Nmom was SOBBING. She started talking about how she had a man flash her when she was about my age, and I was so numb by that point, I told her that situation wasn't comparable and I didn't expect her to understand. Instead of just letting it go or whatever, she proceeds to tell me my biodad raped her all the time (her story about this has changed so much, I really don't believe at this point it ever happened), and just completely flipped everything around to be about her. When her pity party came to a close, she took me clothes shopping. At this point, I was going thru an identity crisis (shocking) and I was doing everything possible to emulate a man. I wanted to act, dress, walk, talk, smell like a man. She went and bought me a whole new masculine wardrobe. Looking back on it now, I'm fairly certian the only way she knows how to show affection is with money and gifts (and that's how she measures the "affection" she recieves.) I'm not upset the about the clothes thing per se, but I'll refer back to it later. I just don't think it was the best decision at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 13, we were going thru the trial. I had to sit down with the District Attorney  **IN A SUBWAY** (the sandwich place) **IN A TOWN OF 800 PEOPLE** (I can't tell you how many people asked me why I was talking to him.) Anyway, he asked me how long I wanted J (pedoneighbour) to go to jail. (*internal dialouge*: A 13 Y/O CAN'T POSSIBLY GIVE A REASONABLE ANSWER TO SOMETHING THEY CAN'T EVEN FULLY GRASP **WHO WHERE THESE PEOPLE)**. I told him I just wanted an apology  (mind you nmom is sitting next to me the whole time and doesn't say a word.) He tells me he's going to put J away and not to worry yadada. So we get home, and Nmom **LOSES IT.** She starts screaming at me about "How could you ask for just an apology! You should be asking for life!" And I'm just kind of standing there because it felt like yes, what he did was wrong, but he was still my friend at some point. She starts berating me about how I'm starting to look just like him. How I dress like him and like the same music he does, and how I'm just becoming him….. I was 13. No job. No money. She was the only one buying my clothes**..??!!** Sorry, that just has always frustrated me.

&amp;#x200B;

So much happened after 14 that detailing all of it here would result in 9 different posts, (I got about halfway thru 15 and then delted it all but it felt good to get out)

So a little bit of backstory to get here;

Nmom keeps trying to contact me and my grandmother (*who is also NC with her because nmom drained her of over a million dollar*s). I found out my old roommate (**and former "best friend** **who knows I'm NC**) decided to give her an update on my life after a year of successfully dodging her watchful eye. And I found via a phonecall from Nmom I mistakenly picked up thinking it was someone else (number isn't saved). At first I tried to explain to her that I have repeatedly told her I need my space and that she isn't respecting that. She just kept pressing on about how she wants to fix our relationship, and how if I can talk to her mother ( who she called "*more toxic*") then I should be able to open up a line of communication with her. She kept throwing out all of this information she had about my life **(that I REALLY FUCKING DIDNT WANT HER TO HAVE)**, and it really felt like she was rubbing it in my face. At some point, I caved and just started berating her right back about how she doesn't respect boundaries and that I wanted nothing to do with her, how even she recognizes my life is so much better since I've stopped talking to her and if she had any truelove for me, she'd leave me the fuck alone. All of the sudden, I'm the irrational one. She drops her tone and starts pulling the whole "*I'm not calling to start a fight, wow I can't believe you're acting like this*." And I knew she was going to do that, and I'm still a little upset with myself for letting her play me like that. Needless to say I've blocked her number, and  I've cut old roommate out of my life as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: I was thinking about writing a letter with no return address to Nmom and detailing for her why I'm not talking to her and why I think it would be best that we not talk. Not for her sake, but I've heard it can be cathartic. Have any of you who have gone NC done something like that or simialr and if so, would you recommend it?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Nmom gonna nmom.**

Warning ⚠ Dont know if this belongs here, but I believe it to

(TL;DR my vaping broke my pc)

For those who have air cooled builds this is a warning, if you don't smoke or vape you may as well close this out. Returned from work the other day and was surprised to see my PC turned off as I had left it updating a game. I thought no biggie and tried to turn it on but it wouldn't turn on "hmmmm..  Im smart, think.. Of course!" Tried to un-plug it and plug it back in again.. Once I discovered that didnt work I realised this was an open her up and take a look scenario. So I did that.. And to my horror.. Every fan within my system was wet. The water had also dripped onto my power unit. Yeeet. Now believe my, everything that could have possibly happened to my unit, spills, damp.. Nothing, checked everything but only the internals were wet. This reminded me of a case about a year ago where my Xbox stopped working, I had it sent off.. (Insurance job) but they sent it back with and I got an email saying they dont cover "water damage" ummm.. Wot? I disputed this with them for a week or so and proved to them where it was stored there was no chance of it receiving water damage, so they replaced it and hadnt thought of it until I saw my pc. Then I thought "huh, my stereo died 2 weeks ago as well".. This was the moment of realisation. Now how could water get on the inside via fans.. Without leaving a drop on the outside? If it was vapour or should I say smoke-_- All the vape had been sucked up by the fans and had settled on the components. I havent found what exact part yet is damaged, fans or power unit but my guess is.. All of them. Its currently in the airing cupboard drying up-_- wish me luck, my stupid ass is gonna need it.

something i learned over time and put it into words, and what finally broke me to go LC/NC with most my family.  Just because your family is blood related to you doesn't mean you have to talk to them, be around them, or see them. If a "friend" or a random stranger was being toxic to you would you keep them around? Would you be the person who gets walked on, stepped on, lied to, beat on, berated constantly, talked down on, or just all round degraded constantly by a "friend" or a random stranger? Why would you take that from a family member just because their blood? You can't choose your family but you sure as hell can choose who you want in your life be it blood or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for WoT.

Took me a long time to come out of the fog and go LC/NC with over 3/4 of my family ( full of enablers, narcs and flying monkeys, many story's and reason why i may one day share) but lurking and reading here for a while and i just finally don't feel alone any more knowing there are many others who have been thru very similar things i have and have been struggling to just say enough is enough.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago My birth mother who i will call M for this and believe is a E/N contacted me asking me how much my rent was out of the blue because my aunt who I've gone NC with wanted to know. This is the convo that followed.

&amp;#x200B;

M:mother  me:myself    A :aunt

&amp;#x200B;

M: A would like to know how much your rent is in "city i live"

Me: why?

M: Cause she wants to know

Me: like just mine or just the range for moving?

M: She is looking to move into an apartment and give "her son" the trailer

Me: she looking for a 1 bed or two the difference in rent is very different

we have a 3 be so what we pay high

after i sent this she tried to start a group chat with me and the Aunt whom i have blocked on a full scale due to random burst of harassment.

Me: i have her blocked. I'm calling you.

M: (as I'm calling her to further explain why yet again i refuse to talk to my A.) Unblock her.

&amp;#x200B;

after she sent that she picks up the phone and i explain that i refuses to talk to her because she blames me for my uncles death (he passed away from cancer a few years ago) just because i was giving a dying man who i also viewed as my only father like figure i had what he asked for to help with the pain.  I live in a 100% recreational state for marijuana and that is what he was asking for) she believes that the weed was the cause of he death and blamed me for it and most likely still does. A also believed that when my Nsister was running from her husband with her son all the while on meth that i was the reason she was on meth when i was raising hell because she was doing it around my nephew and taking to other meth users houses and who knows if they were cooking it or not kind of people. she also said that when i was contacting family hopping they can help me get my nephew away from her for his safety that i would be the reason CPS got involved and i would be to blame if they did because i was going to family for help. ( there is way more to this event and the reason i no longer talk to my family as they blamed me for her meth use and was enabling her) This coming from a woman who i viewed as a mother as M was never there for me or my siblings growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

M: well you should just talk to her any way she is family and she has surgery a few weeks ago to remove a cancerous mass so she needs family support right now.

Me: why am i just learning about this now? and no i will not talk to her still I'm not going down that road again with her. just get the info i need so i can get you the info to give to her.

&amp;#x200B;

at this point in time you can hear her getting upset that i still refuse to give in and magically forgive A and say ok i will talk to her again



M: Ok I will get the info. I love you.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: i will send you the info once i get what she is looking for. \*hungs up

&amp;#x200B;

after i hung up i sit and stew bout how she just tried to guilt trip me into talking to some one who has been doing nothing but causing me pain a person i cant even look at a photo of with out those words of her blaming me for my uncles death playing in my head. what makes it more messed up is before he got cancer i guess he did something to my A that she deemmed unforgivable (idk what it was) and refused to to talk to him. well A forgave him and they stayed together to the day he died with A and me by his side. she refused to talk to him come see him and even after he passed and i called M to let her know he passed all i got from her was ok and hung up the phone, she didn't ask how i was doing or how A was doing nothing no emotion. so her trying to guilt trip me into talk to A from something that happend weeks before that i didn't know anything about was supper messed up. something in me snapped i had enough was done playing those game and have my feelings not cared for even in the slightest like always. i wrong a huge wall of text to her saying how not ok that was that she was never there for me and my siblings all the horrible events that play over and over in my head that involve her. that the anxiety, PTSD, and sever depression was from her and her actions and non actions. i just let her have it 25 years of abuse, neglect, and absence i let lose and told her she can share this wall of text i sent her to family and if she did and they came at me i would just block them tell them to F off and it wasn't like any one even called me or talk to me it was a two way street so me going no contact wouldn't matter any way as no one contacted me any way. and that if she chooses to go no contact it wouldn't bother me any way as I'm the only one to call her just to talk and when she did call it was always about her and her wanting something then just leaving after she got what she wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

After i sent it to her all i got was this and i haven't talked to her since nor has she tried to contact me.

M: I am sorry i did that i have improved myself also since then i love you very much i will not ask you anymore to go against your morals

&amp;#x200B;

i got a apology from her but i doubt it was even real.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the wall of text just feels good to finally get it off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

made it into a pic if any one wishes to use this or just to have it on hand (its free don't want anything from any one and just wish to maybe help those who have difficulty putting it into words)

AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for making a “joke”? Okay so this just happened like 10 minutes ago and I’m still kinda mad but I want some other opinions on wether I’m taking it too far or not.


Me and my girlfriend were having a pretty normal conversation, right up until she sends me a text saying “I just found out my mate has a daddy kink😂”. So I replied with “Oh god😂” and then she follows up with a photo of their conversation which goes like this

Him: Was that a hint, hmmm idk if you could handle me tbh I’m too perverted

Her: Daddy

Him: Don’t

Her: Wot 😂 Noooo

Him: That legit gets me, omfg, do not

Her: (his name), really


Now at this point I ask her “what else did you say” because I started getting a little worried as to what else she was saying after that, so she sent me another photo with this as the conversation.


Him: I will smack you

Her: Oh 🤭

Him: DO NOT USE THAT

Her: OH DADDY

Him: K imma go headbutt a wall

Her: no no no !!!!! I’m sorry !!

Him: Legit sitting here playing Rdr2 with a boner, why me


At this point after viewing that photo I just ignore her message because I’m feeling kind of sick, I don’t know about you guys but this isn’t how i would talk to a girl knowing full well I have a girlfriend. Knowing that someone’s getting turned on by what you’re saying and still continuing? That’s a little strange to me. So I voice my opinion on the matter by saying that I don’t find it funny and in-fact I find it quite hurtful, also given the fact that I don’t know what was said after that last part of the conversation. So we’re back and forth kind of arguing, she’s apologising but also putting up somewhat of a fight when I ask to see what was said after it. Mind you I didn’t force her to show me, I said, and I quote “What did he say after it? Can I see? You don’t have to show me I’m just asking.” To which she follows up with “I’m not going to show you, even tho I was just taking this piss with the guy like mmmm no I’m taken I love you and I wouldn’t change that...” so I proceed to ask in a calmly manner why she wouldn’t show me, simply because she never hesitated to show me the other photos. She then goes on to say it’s because she seen how I reacted and she won’t do it again, she then tells me she’s changed the conversation and are now talking about PC’s, but before I could get my message sent she sends me a photo of the conversation, but I notice something, I look at the time and notice that the photo was taken like 1 minute ago, now these two seem to be back and forth texting and our little argument between the last photo and this photo was easily 5-10 minutes, I also notice the little reaction button on the end of his message in this photo, now In messenger this little button only shows up on the last message that the other person sends, after they send another message it moves down to the next message. The reason I’m explaining this is because after she sent the photo she says “See, Nothing”

After she said that this is what we said

Me: can’t you take a photo after he says he’s got a boner? Because that’s way later in the conversation right? And don’t say you scrolled up because that’s not true

Her: do you really want to see

Me: Yes

Her: DO YOU REALLY WANT TO FUCKING SEE, TELL ME, because if you don’t want to speak to me after this I can’t stop you

Me: Just show me (her name)



Now she sends me the photo of what they said after he mentioned he had a boner, I’ll include his last message.



Him: Legit sitting here playing rdr2 with a boner, why me

Her: I’m sorry did I make you hard 😏

Him: :( Stop it

Her: Am I acc ??

Him: I’m too sensitive, it’s been so long, I am a walking hormone, Legit need shot

After that we argued for a while longer and in the end I said i was going to sleep, but I’m up here writing this so I can be judged, sorry it was so long, I appreciate it if you have read this far!

He wants to leave in the summer and would eb a fantastic asset to our side, creative fantastic shot and free kick, and would bring lots of money into the club through his far east appeal &lt;br /&gt;
이번 여름에 떠나고 싶어해요. 우리편에 훌륭한 자산이 될거에요. 창조적인 슛과 프리킥, 동아시아에 어필할 수 있어서 클럽에 엄청난 돈이 굴러 들어올 겁니다. &lt;br /&gt;

He may be a good aquisition, but don't you think that NUFC should be spending its money on a good defence and a good striker in the summer. His wages could be of better use elsewhere - no offence &lt;br /&gt;
좋은 영입이 될 수도 있겠지만, 뉴캐슬은 수비수와 스트라이커를 영입하는데 돈을 써야 한다고 생각지 않아?? 찾아보면 더 많은 봉급을 줄 수 있는 팀이 있을거야-태클 사양- &lt;br /&gt;

2002 wrx Cobb Ap issue/ Misfire Sorry for wall of text.

Well guys I am at a lost here, I am going to describe the issue then give information about the car.

    It stated yesterday night on my way home, during a WOT pull in the 4k-5k Rpm range my car suddenly hit what felt like a fuel cut (The AP later told me today that it is a Cyl 4 misfire). My first instinct was to take it out of gear, Start the datalog and try to recreate the problem. Doing this and keeping the eye on the AP I noticed that right before I hit "misfire" the AP had turned itself off, this is the first issue I have ever had with it. whenever I got home, I took the AP out of the car, updated it, redownload my map (stage 2+ 93 Oct EBC), uninstalled the AP from the car, then reinstalled it.
    On my way into town I figured I would try it again, turned data logging on, from 60mph in 3rd gear I gave it quarter throttle and slowly went to WOT with the same result but this time the car gave a misfire on Cyl 4 code.

-what I have learned so far-
•Does not happen without a load on the engine (N or 1st with clutch in).
•only happens constantly in 3rd gear, happened 25% of the time in 2nd, never in first.
•only happens during WOT

-Car info-
•2002 impreza WRX Wagon
•Mishimoto intercooler piping
•Mishimoto ancillary hose kit
•Every vac line not touched by that kit has been replaced
•Ebay 2.5in Turbo inlet (used for replacement of the factory inlet)
•Cobb 3 port EBC
•Cobb intake + Air box
•04 WRX intercooler
•GFB Bov (unless this is the problem, please do not preach to me)
•Shop exhaust, still has both cats (have a turbo back and header+ uppipe ready to go on)
•Aftermarket Hid, Halo, led Headlights
•Double din pioneer head unit
•Modest sound system with 4g wire (no shortcuts)
•OEM alternator from an 06 WRX (picked it up for $25 3 months ago)
(I list the electrical things because I think this might have something to do with an charging system spike, however no other symptoms that suggest that)


    Due to these events happening at the exact same time, I think they may be related, I have done searching with no luck.
If anyone has experienced this, fixed it, or has any insight please let me know.

The economics of MGTOW in the female mind. How it messes women's comforts. As the on average more pure hearted gender we tend to view things simplistically, even women's hate of MGTOW. "It's just their ego getting hurt". "Can't stand being held account for their actions". "It's only double standards &amp; hypocrisy, they don't like being treated how they treat men while having no qualms".  blah blah. Women though see the **economics** of it all and the longterm costs it will have for them:

**1)"What? Being pretty is not enough? Now i have to have a character too?"** That's a really annoying factor for them because they have to wear the mask of niceness before they settle down for the beta provider husband in the wall hitting years. They have to invest real effort, straight from their most carefree and rebellious years of youth, to be able to present real results or at least emulate them even for the most short term marginally redpilled chode fling now. And that sucks for them. They are being "progress raped", they actually have to work out how to evolve as human beings.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) "What? No more carousel riding?**" They wasted so many years trying to demonise celibacy, rub on our faces the "tragedies" their grandmas and mothers have to go through in the traditional model, and how modern women must be liberated from all these "dark age chains".  The concept of damaged goods is their worst enemy, and the exposure of shaming tactics like "true men take on their shoulders a single mom", leave them vulnerable when they are left alone  with chad's bastard child.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)"Bring back ma orbiters mathafathers".** Men waking up, actually having some dignity, and not wanting to be reduced to hungry corpse eating eagles waiting to feast upon the relics of their past relationships simply sucks. Having a backup list of potential suitors more than willing to substitute the "evil heartbreaker"(ignoring they will be the future holders of this title), is a must asset for women. Depriving her even of the most basic ego boosting attention of the satellites that daily surround her, would make her fall in a state of dread.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)"What do you mean my mom's techniques ain't working".** Most women were trained by their mothers in the art of manipulation and those manipulative archetypes have been for an awful long time rationalised and honed from "harmless nurturing feats of normality" to even full fledged pedestalised principles we cannot do without. Having to actually sit down and work now new ways of "quiet control", because women avoid physical domination of the male population,  and this is all the more annoying because they prefer to use their brains for more rigorous processes like choosing the next pair of shoes or gossiping the worst dressed woman in the room.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)"Who taught those chodes the ten holy thug commandmends huh?".** Red pilled men are for example familiar with the street wisdom of "whoever screws you up, will screw you up again". Women cannot play anymore the "repented girl" part. Or the "i had a change of heart and now i want you back part. Will be nothing like you knew". Or the "hey it was just a slippup, won't happen again, after all you've been neglecting me a bit you know, i'm human too, ain't made out of steel honey". And this has broader social consequences as well. When she gets a name... she has it. **Once a cheetah always a cheetah**. Once she is on the thot radar of men, she ain't going on the wife material list i tell ya that much... .

&amp;#x200B;

**6)"What do you mean start buying my first cats in my early 20s? You wot mate?"** With the vast rise of MGTOW Monks women are being deprived even those very unfulfilling short serotonine spikes of the hookups that consume most of their youth. And as MGTOW knowledge now spreads even to teen boys, "teen female widows" will be a thing too i guess.

&amp;#x200B;

**7)"Don't listen to the bad guys, I ain't inherently evil, it's just that your insides whisper to me they are so itching to finally be freed!"** This refers to the far and few (but maybe not so few as we want to believe), borderline women out there that can certainly send a man from as extreme deviations as hommie-cide for the shake of  her "love", to even suicide after all the gaslighting and mind raping. In its quest for truth, the red pill had to turn to psychology as well, and there it was epuipped with many tools and interesting stories, making those snake-morphing women's task of blending in, a more demanding one. And this knowledge  is not only useful to filter out the raging medusa psychos, but sadly applies to various degrees at handling interactions with most types of women.

&amp;#x200B;

And as women are calculating creatures that know (or at least pretend to know) their best interest, women think strategically at some more longterm consequences the MGTOW wave will have:

&amp;#x200B;

**8)"My daddy, I just want my daddy back. Not the saddist chad i met on tinder dude, i mean the state".** If the double standards cease to apply to the degree they were, and  women lose some of their undeserved privilidges this will be a serious hit under the belt for their plans on living off the sweat of the many by sheer power of utilising the puppy eyes of victimhood. After all the best type of cucking, is the "zero investment cucking", which cant happen even with the submissivest of men, who will still require some amount of presence. but only with an ethereal faceless entity like the welfare state.

&amp;#x200B;

**9)"Back on your wheel little hamsters, momma wants to see some sweating and aching".** What will happen if men unplug for the serotonine seeking matrix. If they just decide they got sick of the consumerist society and all its tentacles physical and noetic. What will happen to the complex structure that's been giving women the most comfortable life of their history and moreover even encouraged them to live like men once did on top of it?  What will happen when the "the juice ain't worth the squeeze" evolves to the even more rebellious realisation of  "Jesus mate, I AM the one who is getting squeezed. Is that 80 hours a week finance/ whatever job really doing anything other than eating my soul up?" And what will even be the political consequences or the effects on the very fabric of the structure of modern society itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**10)"In space noone can hear me scream, give me my earth back!"** In the past women could be emo, could be the goth girl, the skater girl, the gamer girl, the meToo girl. She could scream for attention at any and every direction and utilising whatever fad culture was prevalent at the time, but what if there are no ears left to hear. What if men get so in state, that the damsel in distress becomes but an echoing voice in the dessert. What impact would that have on women globally? **"You mean we have to become actual feminists and adopt equal responsibilities too??!!"** Oh please someone give me a tissue, my heart goes to all those women who cannot make men dance to their siren songs anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

**11)"To hell with all of you betas, but my uber chads too??!!"** Let's say most average and around average guys opt out. What will happen if that cream of the crop, those blue blooded uber chads with all the resources, all the social proof and the charisma, just decide "screw that, i opt out too". In what unfathomable chasms of desperation will the immaculate poor maiden fall then? Hell hath no fury than women being scorned even by those who take women for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

Those were my two cents on the basic economics of MGTOW guys, hope you enjoyed, and maybe even a little insight on why this harmless wave looks like a tsunami to their sharper calculating senses.

2003 Honda Valkyrie: Weird misfire/stumble between approximately 4K-5k rpm Hi everybody,

2003 Valkyrie having issues.


I’ve run into a weird situation and could use some input. The bike runs great from idle to redline if I just roll on the throttle. It does great if I snap the throttle open going from low rpm to redline. If I’m at high rpm, 5k+, and go WOT, it is fine. The issue is if I’m between 3.5/4k - 5k rpm and snap the throttle open. The bike seems to lose power momentarily and I can feel it misfiring and stuttering for a few seconds. It will then recover and pull as hard as it should. If I’m in that rpm range and I roll on the gas, it seems fine. It’s not noticeable in first or second gear, hardly in third, but is easily noticed in 4th and 5th.

Mods:
K&amp;n without prefilter
Cobra pipes w/ baffles
38 slows
115 mains
Factory pro needles w/ clip in 3rd pos
Pilot - 2 turns out
Desmogged

I am very confused as to what’s going on. I’ll try moving the clips to different positions on the needles tomorrow. But again, it seems to run great everywhere but this specific situation. I bought the bike with 81k miles on it and will be doing a timing belt change and valve clearance adjustment soon, but I can’t imagine either of those have anything to do with this problem. I’ve also run several very concentrated tanks of Techron through it.

So yeah... thoughts? Should I order up some new interstate springs? They promote better throttle response from the stock standard springs correct? I also can’t imagine a vacuum leak would affect it under these narrow parameters and not have an effect somewhere else.

Does anyone know the background of some WOT emblems? There are a LOT of emblems in WOT that have ridiculously gemeric names like "skull 3" and no other information. They only just recently started putting in symbols with unit names, although some of those are still confusing, like "81st Armored Division." The only country I've ever found to have had an 81st AD was Iran, and they didn't use that symbol from what i can tell.

I have, through research and personal knowledge, deciphered a number of the symbols, but I'm only scratching the surface. There are a ton i don't recognize and I'm hoping maybe someone here knows a few.

-The Ghost is 11th Pz Div.
-The double headed eagle and cross is 3rd Pz Rgt, 2nd Pz Div- as is the red dragon on a white rhombus. One is early war, the other late.
-The stag head with a cross in the antlers is the Pz.Jg.Abt. 521
-There are 2 variations of a tiger's head which could be substituted as the emblem for Schw.Pz.Abt. 509
-The yellow "3-9" is the vehicle number for an M8 Scott named Laxative that was in the 32nd Armored Regt, 3rd Armored Div.
-The cat eating the treads is the emblem for the US Tank Destroyer Regiment; the black panther on a shield with the scroll under is the 761st TD Battalion (the Regiment, like the MP Regiment, was split into dozens or hundreds of separate battalions which were then attached to other units in a support role)
-The kiwi bird is the 3rd New Zealand Division
-The Kangaroo is the Australian 6th Armored Div
-The double cross is the Slovak Mobile Division
-The red shield with what looks like a knight (it's Joan of Arc) is the French 4th Cuirassier Regt
-The blue circle with a silhouette of France and cross of Lorraine is the 2nd Armored Div (post war 2nd Armored Brigade)
-The white and blue circle with a bunch of lines in it (it's a stylised gunner) is the French 7th Tank Battalion
-The card suites like the tealish club and the red spade are French symbols for what unit a tank belonged to
-The card suites with the white diamond around them are Belgian formation symbols
-The red, blue and yellow triangle is the US symbol for an armored division (without a number or nickname, it's a real generic one)
-The buffalo outline is the 10th Pz Div
-The filled in white circle is the 1st Republican Guard Hammurabi Armored Div (Iraq)
-IJA Armored divisions are found in the Inscriptions section; Attack (2nd Div) and Steel (4th Div)
-British squadron desognations are also found in the empty red triangle and the circle with the number 47 in it (A sqdrn and C sqdrn)
-The Longship is the Norwegian Telemark Bataljon
-k230 is a markong from the 36th Tank Brigade, 4th Guards Armored Corps
-The white circle with red banner and laurels is the mark of the Soviet Guards tanks (Order of the Red Banner specifically)

And of course there are a slew now of Australian and Polish emblems that are marked for what unit they are, so I've left those off. Anyone know of any others I've missed or been stumped by?

[Discussion] Fuel economy under static load with dynamic throttle position I just did a 3 hour drive on BC Hwy #3 Crowsnest from Vancouver-inland and was thinking alot about the vehicle on the drive. This highway has several mountain passes with elevations reaching over 1700m. I only climbed the Sunday summit and the Allison pass. I don't believe any of the hills are steeper than an 8% grade but hopefully someone who's travelled this route more than I have can correct me if Im wrong.

I drive and old '92 ford 1/2ton pickup and I've only recently brought the motor back to a reasonable power level closer to factory again, I'm very used to this highway and have done the drive many times, I normally ascend these hills in 3rd gear at 2500rpm sometimes higher but never lower, roughly around 70km/h. If I had to guess, id would say I'm around 50% throttle or more. If I tried 4th gear it would slow down and I would have to downshift so I just use third.

Now that my truck has a bit more power restored to it I was able to climb all the hills at 90km/h in 4th at around 2000rpm, but at full throttle. Certain hills would have WOT for 10 minutes or more.

My discussion topic is about fuel economy in these situations, as well as the wear on the motor under full load at a slower rpm or half throttle or more, is it harmful, is it beneficial? Aside from fuel economy, which would produce less emissions?


I have a feeling that WOT at a lower rpm is more fuel efficient, but the NOx emissions would be higher, and CO2 would be lower. As well as reducing engine wear, I'm not a practised chemist or an auto mechanic so I only know so enough to get me in trouble.


TL;DR: tell me what you know about throttle position and rpm, and how it relates to fuel economy, engine wear, and emissions.

1986 Evinrude E140TLCD stalls under load at WOT Bought our 1987 18’ Invader with an ‘86 2-stroke Evinrude 140 hp outboard over a year ago. Had multiple mechanics look her over and do a few thousand worth of work. I had it moored out on our beach all summer. It starts cold, I usually have to manually prime the engine (pushing in the key at ignition doesn’t do it), and there is significant blue smoke (oil injected), but I’ve been told that’s normal. We can run all day at around 2500 RPM’s in the water. Whenever I open the throttle up past, say, 3000 RPMs, it stalls. It has, on occasion, not stalled, but 95% of the time it does. We winterized the boat last night, ran it on the muffs, did WOT and it did not die. I opened up the carb cover to see if there was anything floating around in there, but didn’t readily see any blockages of the high jets.

Here is what we have repaired so far:

Pumped out old fuel and verified that oil injection is working
New power pack
New carbs, and adjusted reed valves
New coil packs
New plugs (though they look fouled last night, will replace them next season)
New prop/hub
New water pump
New battery
New fuel lines
New fuel filter, in-line filter, primer bulb
We have good compression and spark

Would like to have it running at 100% next season, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Trying to make a list of things to fix/assess next year.

A paladin explores homeopathy, fails &gt; Be me, rookie DM. Be not me, party of elf warlock, dwarf paladin, duerger rogue, and tortle fighter.

&gt; Party encounters NPC cleric on the road, gets quest to clear monsters out of holy ruins. Party decides monsters too monstrous, returning to town for reinforcements.

&gt; Horses tired, party spots wooded grove for some sweet longrest.ogg

&gt; Tortle has no darkvision, so he takes first watch shift at dusk, then retires to sleep in covered wagon (2heavy4horse). Tortle sleeps tucked up in his shell.

&gt; Next watch, Duerger hears crunching in brush around camp, searches but fails perception check. Heads back to campsite to resume watch.

&gt; Tortle wakes up to scratching on his shell and something moving him, alarmed because's he's 750lbs hoss tortle.

&gt; Party's encountered three white-and-blue spiders that seem to appear and disappear before their very eyes.

&gt; Spiders land two bites on tortle, he failed both con saves (4d8 poison on fail). Second fail for 30 poison damage. He had 21hp remaining.

&gt; Party dispatches all three spiders, scrambles to remember tortle medicine.

&gt; Paladin lays hands on tortle, uses remaining 8hp to heal.

&gt; Tortle's wounds close up a bit, but he doesn't stir. Upon inspection, tortle appears unconscious but stable. Party is grateful 750lbs unconscious tortle is already in wagon.

&gt; Party's face when they realize they're a day away from monster-ruins cleric and a day from cleric in the town that sent them on their original mission.

&gt; Hopehedontdie.cgi

&gt; Dwarf paladin: "We should probably take some of the venom with us in case it helps them identify what's wrong."

&gt; Good idea, proud of my party's problem-solving. Duerger passes skill checks to extract venom from one of the spiders.

&gt; But mfw no one in the party tries to identify weirdly colored spiders that seemlessly disappear and reappear OR their mysteriously non-lethal venom.

&gt; Me: "OK, what next?"

&gt; Dwarf paladin: "Can we give him some more poison to see if that helps?"

&gt; Wot?

&gt; Me, smiling internally: "Roll medicine."

&gt; Paladin player: "Two, so that's... a modified one."

&gt; Me: "You clearly remember hearing from some physician that giving small amounts of poison to a patient can help them overcome stronger, more harmful poisons. You don't remember who said it or where you heard it. But it's called heemy pathy or hammy pathy or something."

&gt; Despite party's brief meta attempts to avoid it, paladin pours entire vial of pure, extracted phase spider venom down the throat of his unconscious tortle companion.

&gt; Party disappointed when nothing happens. Duerger extracts another vial of venom to hold on to. Party resumes watch and resting, intending to get assistance when they make it to town the next day.

&gt; Tortle wakes up in the middle of the next watch as the venom wears off. When party gets back to town, he eats all of the raw potatoes at the inn, entirely unfazed.

tldr: Paladin attempts homeopathy to cure  paralyzed tortle, fails, poisons tortle further, and learns nothing. Tortle feelsgood.jpg anyway bc potato.

21 years after e break up and i still found her like we were never really departed wit each other This young lady was my 'soul mate', we were so much in love and had pictured married life wit kids together. With just a small misunderstanding between us one day, she let herself drifted away without really done much explaining about why and what had triggered such acts..and one day, Out of nothing, she just popped a surprised question to a guy (her office-mate) 'do u want to marry me?'..he must be bloddy shocked to hear that but who doesn't say yes when a beautiful girl suddenly ask u to marry her?..(to this day, i don't have a clue of why she did wot she did that day).

Nowadays, we still talk and chat on e phone occasionally. Talking about how we were perfectly blended in love, pure love! Today, she send me her recent selfie pic. and honestly i couldn't take my eyes off that pic because somehow i still can feel her inside me by looking at it..she once said that she's not actually living a happy life wit her husband but yet she couldn't ran out from him either.
What i had told her was that if we still have God's plan for us to be together again as a married lovers, so be it as i'm sure be the happiest man alive when it happened.

Black Friday Pressures Subienation, Black Friday is coming... I've already swapped out most of the lights on my WRX and added in some slight cosmetics (pinstripe grille/badge recolors) and now the axle back exhaust has caught my eye.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty intrigued by Nameless' offerings, and since I live in CA where it can be a little car mod unfriendly, I wanted to go for something that is not a muffler delete. Essentially something that can be heard as you cruise along till you slam on the gas and go WOT.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask between choosing the 4" muffler for Nameless or 5" and if anyone had any opinions on it? People have told me the deletes aren't too bad but they get troublesome to live with after time. Car is a base model 2019 WRX.

&amp;#x200B;

Common! Just have one drink, she won't mind. These two coworkers are talking and the one invites the other for a drink. "No, I can't. I promised her I wouldn't drink anymore." says the one. "Just come along and have one drink, one drink." says the other and the one finally agrees.

They get to the bar and have a drink and shoot a game of poo. Then they have another and another and another. He comes up to his friend and says "My wife is going to KILL me! I threw up on my shirt!" "Relax here." He puts 20 bucks in the guys shirt pocket. "Just tell your wife that we were shooting pool and a guy threw up on your shirt so he stuck 20 bucks in your pocket to have it cleaned." "Yeah!" the guy says. "That will work!"

He gets home and his wife says "You're drunk!" "Naw naw naw it ain't wot you think. At all. This guy threw up on me and put 20 dollars in my pocket. See for yourself." She digs the money out of his pocket "There's 40 dollars here." "Oh yeah, he also shit in my pants."

Backfiring on acceleration Hey guys apparently this is a common problem so I figured I’d share my fix - if you go WOT and you get some backfire or pops right before or during the acceleration there are two really common issues causing it. Exhaust leak at the manifold or down pipe or your spark plug gap. If this is happening check your spark plug gap, if you are tuned then you usually need to bring the gap closer such as 0.28-0.32 in my experience. If that doesn’t fix it check the studs to the o2 housing from the turbo to make sure they’re tight .

Hope this helps some people

List of all FilmStruck streaming movies (as of Nov 25, 2018) With FilmStruck three days away from ending, I know that lots of you--like me--will want to take note of all the rare streaming movies you missed. I have a blog about hard to find movies (Hidden Films) and it's bad enough I miss so many rare films screened at MoMA, Lincoln Center, etc.; now this, too!

Anyway, I know there's a bunch on here that can otherwise only be seen at college film libraries or perhaps third party DVD sites; stay tuned for more details on WHERE you can find the most obscure of these movies. But for now, here is the list (FilmStruck movies only; I'm working on a list of the Criterion streaming offerings, though I saw an announcement that Criterion is planning a new streaming service: [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6044-new-independent-criterion-channel-to-launch-spring-2019](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6044-new-independent-criterion-channel-to-launch-spring-2019)

Is Brisbane Australia a safe country at night? /u/brackfriday_bunduru has opinion. Wot's you'res? Did you see the post a way back on Reddit about safety and crime in Aust?

/u/brackfriday_bunduru

&gt;Australia is an extremely safe country

Stop right there ya cunt! Did you look at me the wrong way? “Some of me mates from Sydney’ll probably fucken glaaaaaaaass ya ya cuntie!” is the national fucking anthem. Have’nt you heard of Baden Clay and the students who were all murdered and the real life Wolf Creek that happened?

&gt;Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs which would be the Aus equivalent of the Bay Area in San Fran

Bullshit ya cunt. Sydney is basically Bankladesh Meets Beiyching. The eastern suburbs are basically like a giant krakc den filled suburb in Brooklyn by the sea. Like the crack filled block in that suburb. Sydneys eastern suburbs basically has got less interesting things than one below average block in Brooklyn.

&gt;People are definitely rude to one another here

No shit ya cunt

&gt;What’s not common here are physical fights.

You wot may-ate?

&gt;Fist fights are almost newsworthy they’re that uncommon.

Bullshit ya cunt. This is classic disinformation. We don’t have guns cunts so we’re all good there are no fist fights.

Like the hundreds of fist fights at parties, worksites, clubs and pubs EACH FUCKING WEEK around the country? You can’t go to some pubs in Sydney or Brisbane without seeing one or two or more every Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night. The courts are FUCKING FULL of cases where idiots have been fighting or punching some guy because he “spoke to my girl whatta cunt Oi’m gonna punch that cuntie ya cunts!”, not to mentions the fist fights between wives and husbands.


&gt;People just yell at one another and look tough

See above.

You would see fewer fistfights in clubs and bars in LA in a year, than you would see in the Sydney pub scene in a single Friday night. In LA, you do that shit you are in shackles within 30 minutes - or you are shot.
In Straya cunt you get 5 hours community service and a kiss on the lips from a nice fat lady, and a backslap from your mates.

Overall very disappointed. Disinformation level 1/10 only a dumb Eastern Suburbs Sydneysider would buy into that type of crap. Probably an ex-Newington.

Help. Need advice on an ex. Ok so. This might be long.

I’ve had this girl friend for about 9 months her name was Hannah. We broke up once and got back together in between that period (about 2-3 months) I got together with this other girl and we had sex. Then we broke up and I went back to Hannah because I realized I wasn’t over Her. Then we dated again (after some patching up and trust issues). This went on for about 3 more months and then she broke up with me. When I asked why she said “I don’t know. I loved you one day and the next I didn’t.” Big oof. Then we stayed friends and made a promise to each other to stay friends. And we did for a long time and then I’m started to talk to other girls and stuff and one day at school my close friend pulls me aside and says “dipolarbear, you know Hannah’s wearing your sweater to see if you would notice right?” And I’m like “wot how do you know” and this woman TOLD my close friend that she wanted to see if I would notice. I think she did it as an effort to get me to think about a relationship again. Then she’s gets flirty with me (she knows I know how she flirts) and is like playfully grabbing my hand and and I sat down with her and told her that I don’t want a relationship with her because it’s just gonna end bad and I’m not comfortable with the flirting and this and that. AND SHE GOT MAD at me. Started ignoring me and ended our streak. I’m fine with that I’d rather her be out of my life than  her be in it and start destroying the progress I have. Well. Now she’s trying to text me and is having playful arguments with me and friends about sex and shit. I don’t know what to do anymore. We broke up about 3-4 months ago I think? And I’m not gonna lie I think about her sometimes. I say I don’t but idk. Kinda miss having a relationship more than having her.

Sorry for the long post. Just need some help. Feel free to ask anything.

Bad Mazdaspeed3 injector seals? I have a 2012 Mazdaspeed3, 78k miles. Currently has a Cobb accessport, JBR intake, catback exhaust, and HPFP internals tuned for 91 and E30 (18 psi +/- 2). I’ve been noticing abnormally high knock under WOT, typically between 2-3 degrees, no matter which fuel/tune I’m on. The knock isn’t consistent though, as some pulls I’ll see under 1 degree. Fuel trims look good too, so I don’t suspect a vacuum leak.

I’ve heard that bad injector seals can create knock, but most say they become audible when bad. I haven’t noticed any noise, so is it possible that bad injector seals are causing abnormal knock? What mileage do they typically go bad?

P0172 Code Help for 2017 WRX Hello fellow WRX peeps, recently I threw a P0172 CEL for system fuel too rich right after I had just refueled. I’m no mechanic by any means but after doing some research I had found that some simple things to check first were to clean the intake filter and spray down the MAF. Then to check for any vacuum leaks.

After having done these it was still reading the code, but what’s throwing me off is that the car is literally running and idling like it normally does (which is it sounds, feels and runs fine). I’m also monitoring the Accessport and the AFR is ranging between its normal values ( which I found was between 10 - 20 and 14.7 at idle), next thing is that it’s hitting its peak boost at WOT perfectly fine (no bogging or stuttering). And again it’s just running as it normally does. I’ve also made sure to securely tighten the air filter after cleaning.

I had then just reset the ECU learning and cleared the codes using my AP because of everything that I’ve observed b/c I hate seeing the CEL light, hill assist light, traction light, and blinking cruise control all at once on my cluster.

Sorry for the essay, but I was just wondering if there were any other precautions I should take before making any unknown problems worse and if there’s anything else I should look into. THANKS!

2002 WRX Engine Breakup? Hello everyone, got a bit of an issue here and am looking for a little bit of guidance/advice.

So, I have owned the car for a week and on the first day was getting a code for a Cylinder 3 misfire, No big deal. Replaced coil packs and spark plugs for C1 and C3. (Planning on doing the other side soon but i'm broke now lol). This fixed my problem and the car ran flawlessly other than the horrid grinding of my bad wheel bearing that i'm getting fixed on Monday.

But, I was screwing around last night driving a little spiritedly after washing my car and got a similar but less harsh sort of breakup when on WOT, on the high end of the RPM range. I'm thinking that it is due to my accessport because it was turning on and off after what I assume was a bad connection to the OBDII port.

Im really just looking to see if anyone else has had a similar problem and what they did to fix it. Thanks, and drive safe guys!

The OB Chronicles: OBlocked Before I begin this story, there's gotta be at least one of you who's wondering what OB's FB profile is like outside his virtual tard cries?

For starters, he uses lots of anime profile pics (almost all of them are Naruto). If that wasn't enough, OB occasionally posts pics of himself shirtless, and almost every single one of his deranged selfies have horrible picture quality. Ironically, he even claims that he is an experienced photographer.

When he isn't posting bitch fits or shitty pics with the same quality as his mental state, OB will farm for pity, saying shit like "EYe aM fUK up" just for the sake of attention. His pity moments even escalated to a point to where he even made a fake suicide video. Worst of all, his "friends," other tards who attend the same school as him, fall for his bullshit every time.

That is at least, his profile from what I remember. I deleted my account a while back and haven't checked his profile since maybe two years ago.

TL/DR: He acts like a black retarded version of WingsOfRedemption online.

Anyways, enjoy the story!

&gt; Be me, in high school

&gt; A while, a few months specifically, after The Showdown

&gt; Despite all the past advice I gave to OB to control his behavior online, the dumbass is incapable of learning from his actions

&gt; If that wasn't enough, the living anomaly made a habit of private messaging me on a constant basis

&gt; He usually types all kinds of unusual gibberish and just sends it to me

&gt; Either he thinks he's funny or he's trying to speak to me in his rendition of tardspeak

&gt; Probably both

&gt; Having enough of his shit at some point, I tell OB that I'll block him if he doesn't stfu

&gt; OB whines and stops briefly

&gt; Next day

&gt; Another stream of tardspeak is sent to me

&gt; Why am I not surprised

&gt; Following up with my warning, I block him on Messenger

&gt; A few hours later

&gt; I get a notification from one of his shills- I mean, "friends"

&gt; They're saying shit along the lines of "WAAAAOW ANON WOT YU DU TU OHH BEEE?!?!"

&gt; Why the hell are they so concerned?

&gt; I go to OB's facebook profile

&gt; mfw I'm welcomed to multiple posts involving him swearing at me

&gt; One in particular said "FAK YU ANON WY YU BLAHK ME YU DUM FUK EYE DINDU NUFFIN"

&gt; Bullshit

&gt; His "friends" are kissing his ass in the comments too

&gt; I decide to go reason with the shills

&gt; Me: "Oh please. You're mad because I blocked him for annoying me?"

&gt; Shills: "DATS JUST OH BEE'Z WEI OF BEENG FWENDWY YU DUNT KNU ENNETANG EBAUT EEM"

&gt; Me: "Bitch I knew his dumbass since elementary. I'm well informed of all the shit he's done"

&gt; Shills are silent

&gt; Victory is mine again

&gt; However, the shills are still begging me to unblock him because they still insist I hurt the spud's feelings

&gt; Still being ~~nice to a fault~~ stupid at the time, I give OB one more chance

&gt; Not even less than a day and he blows that last chance

&gt; I block his ass without warning

&gt; Fortunately he didn't throw a spergfit this time

&gt; However, this wasn't without repercussions on my end

&gt; Little did I know at the time that blocking him would be the creature's primary reason for harassing me on the train from college as of today

Kimchisoup's adventure to 60 continues! Ooof!  So, I started posting an update earlier and was too tired to finish, so I saved my text somewhere and now it's gone.  RIP!  Well, I don't remember all the names of the people who I met in the last few days but, that doesn't mean I'm not grateful, I promise!  So, I got 39 on my 9th day and decided to head to COM!  As soon as I get there, I start soloing some haze golems at the entrance until about 20 minutes later, someone from the guild Anonymous hit me up for a stables group!  Wow, such a great group!  Once again, sorry for not remembering your names!  I do recall a necro by the name of Bloood, my buddy Dawck and Ioqol, (sp) was in the group again and a few others.  Solid group, much xp, tons of win.  I stayed in COM until 41 and then headed out for the night, porting when I could and making some decent money.  People are crazy generous with tips and won't take no for an answer!  Thank you to everyone who's helped me along the way and hopefully I can get a Lumi staff later today!  If anyone has one for sale, let me know!  Or, if I could borrow one for a week, I'd love you forever :)

Day 11 and new adventures await!  I checked back into COM for a bit and then started porting again.  The port tells do not stop coming!  People recommended I start a drood and I'm happy with my choice.  There is never a shortage of people who need to travel and not having to run everywhere is huge, thanks for the good call!   COM group broke up and Bumpty came in clutch with a tell asking if I was familiar with quadding.   I knew the gist of it, but never really did it, so he hooked it up with a port and POTG, then we headed to OT.  Gave me some advice, showed me some tips and I quadded on and off in OT till 42-43.  Shout out to Vadored, Strazha, Mrpeanut and everyone else who gave me someone to talk to while being extremely generous with port tips.  While in OT, I decided I was tired of getting lost so I started leveling Sense heading.  (At level 43, what a noob!) haha.  While leveling this I worked on Tracking and foraging as well because I'll definitely need these down the road.  Shout out to Shamfu, Slopster, Linolen, Gilasik, Deebbun, Strataa, Alfredino, Zedreil and Siberia!  One thing I can't do for TOO long is the same thing, so Runuk hit me up and wanted to kill some Hill Giants!  We went to rathe and killed those for a bit then I called it a night.  Not bad PP, but definitely too many hp's to kill them faster than they respawn, at least at my level.  Day 11 in the bag and it was time to call it a night.

Day 12 Started a little similar, ported a bit and got some pp for a POTG then headed back to OT for a bit.  I like to start my day off with some ports for some pp, or free ports for corpse runs etc. then buy a POTG and crack if available.  If you ever see me and need a port, you do not have to tip!  I have to pay it forward somehow so, feel free to ask for one anytime.  Unless I'm dungeon crawling, then I can't just leave my group haha.  I pretty much bounced between OT and random spots that people want to group in.   I don't necessarily have to hit the "hot spots"  to have fun, so if anyone wants to group in some random area, let me know and I'll join ya.  As long as it's not lower guk.... shout out to Callgiirl and Shadowdinah, they just randomly tipped me and ported to wherever the guy I was portng was headed.  I believe they went to Lavastorm wth us, haha.  Shout out to Ashadar and Anagin!  Anagin just hit me up while I'm typing this and said he saw my posts and is back after a few years.  Welcome back my friend, it's great to have you :)  Towards the end of day 12 I dinged 45 in OT and Runuk hit me up for some CC leveling.  We managed to be the only ones in zone for a while so we killed some geodudes for a couple of hours.  Not terrible xp and decent loot.  Pretty safe little area if you can get to it and it hit the nostalgia button again for me.   I haven't been there in years!  Shout out to Manatree for hooking us up with a POTG while we hunted, you da man!   Ended the night porting a few people and logged.

Day 13 wasn't very eventful, logged on and grouped with some homies in Lguk.  Pulled like 3 times and it didn't end well either time, haha.  Luckily I have gate.  All good though, can't have success my whole way to 60, right?  I was a little burned out from the previous days so I just logged for the night.   I just wasn't in the mood and sometimes some sleep makes things better.

Day 14 and I started writing this.  I am currently killing Dwarves in BB at the docks and the mini camp near the ocean.  I'm getting 3-4 blue tics a quad and I'm in a hell level.  I see myself staying here until 49 or so, depending on the xp.  Extremely easy camp and very safe, definitely a great spot!  And the best thing is, it's not camped!  I just wanted to thank everyone for reading and to the guys and girls who've helped me along the way!  It will not be forgotten,  I promise!  I'll be quad kiting for a few hours then who knows, let's group somewhere!  I may start doing daily updates again, this WOT is too long haha.  Ah well, Kimichisoup out, gotta get these levels.  Take care guys and see you in Norrath :)

Do you ever feel like you want to leave your life behind? (slightly long) I come from a family that's reasonably nice and stable but I have never felt comfortable where I am, just generally.

The whereabouts that I've grown up in aren't too warm in any sense of the word, the weather's mediocre and I don't feel truly connected to anybody. Early on in my life I was moved to another primary school and I failed to make any real attachments to anybody there, if anything it wasn't exactly friendly (to say the least). It likely shaped who I am as a person now, quite sheltered and negative.

My isolation continued even more when I was home-schooled through ages 12.5-16.5, I basically had no idea what adolescence would entail and I still don't exactly know myself at 17 years and under a half. Believe me, it was an absolutely tragic waste of time and I learned next to nothing.

I'm at a sixth form college now (British) despite my 4 GCSEs, I won't say anything too specific but it's the most depressing experience I've been through in my whole life. Not attributed to any bullying or similar nonsense as it's a passive place, but I feel like it's a combination of oppressive factors.

There are generally three personality archetypes there: overly, falsely positive, mute and socially awkward or just plain socially awkward. The building is slightly mucky and not too thrilling as-well. I feel like it's a culmination of the worst things I've experienced, an environment with no meaningful social connection, a sense of shabbiness and low quality and an overall meandering, drudgery-filled greyness.

The worst thing is people seem to have the impression I'm some kind of invalid, they're putting this woman in lessons to support me who isn't really that useful (sits down for the duration more or less and occasionally tries to organise me somehow). I've asked my father to tell them to drop the support but he thinks I need it...

They'll support you everywhere but emotionally apparently, self-pitying as that sounds everybody is just adrift from each-other. So densely packed with people and yet so immensely lonely and miserable. It sounds sentimental but I feel like through all the technology and stability people have forgotten the importance of being human.

I always come home and indulge myself in everything that I feel like I'm missing digitally, music, fiction, games and whatnot give me a false sense of purpose and being somewhere else, but it is never enough. I was reduced crying recently in my bed, embarrassingly. Nobody witnessed it thankfully (midnight) but it's starting to occur to me that I can't endure all of this forever.

I can't understand the other people in my family, they just seem content with how things are. I literally have to go to the sixth form so we can claim the financial benefits and survive, and yet despite the horrible bleakness you've got my father stalwartly trying to help me with the increasingly boring and copious college work, my brother roaring through the household walls as he plays video games with his online chums, my sister trying out all sorts of foods and advent calendars and nonsense in-addition to my mother persevering every day with the housework and dinner.

I wish I hadn't been born in England, granted it's first world, but while you're not at physical risk there's this apparent trend for coldness, misery and mental illness. Maybe my perception is warped and I can only see the negative, but I feel like it's an alcoholic uncle of a country, likeable if you look past the horrid bits and not responsible for introducing anything interesting into the world.

I suppose my point is that today it dawned on me how measly and pathetic my existence is after a long time, and I want to abandon it as soon as I am capable.

Probably not a good place to ask, but are there any good countries for animation courses? There's one at the local Uni but I can't stand the idea of staying here again for multiple more years. I'm receptive to learning a new language, and as I've discovered I actually have a genuine interest in language. I have a mind that when I can access my junior ISA I will try flying off and living somewhere else for the rest of eternity. I'm not too attached to anything at home, spare maybe my tablet, the weights and my computer, so I'm extremely receptive to everything changing altogether.

If you ever feel down, just remember it could be worse, you could be British like me. Unless you are British, in which case you're SHAGGED M8 U WOT BRAV DID U SEE THE FOOTY LAST NITE INNIT LET'S GIT DRUNK AN PISS IN DA ALLEYWAY

TL;DR: Life's lonely, repetitive and probably a few inches from poverty. Compensating for it by wallowing in my own misery and wasting time with distractions. Mad self-pitying waste of a person wants to leave but he can't just yet, know anywhere good to go?

Setback After Many Days Clean: What I Learned Hey everyone!

I had a setback today. Am I bummed? Nope! Am I falling to pieces? Nope! Do I feel like my life is out of control?? Absolutely not!!

I believe many of us have developed a delusion when it comes to NoFap. This delusion is a central dogma in many of our journeys, and dictates how we approach setbacks. What am I talking about specifically? I am talking about the fact that most of us look at setbacks (or relapse if that's your preferred term) as a failure. "That's it! I failed, I did something wrong, I felt short of my goal, I am a failure". See how quickly we *internalize* this idea of failure? See how quickly we go from this is *what I did*, to this is *who I am*? I bet you did notice that! You are on this sub after all, meaning you know what's actually good for you, and you are an all around smart lad. Well guess what you might not know??? You can look at this whole thing differently!!

I had a setback today, and I went stumbling over to my roommate ready to tell him that I had no idea what I was gonna do about my alleged failure. He looked me in the eyes and said, "NoFap isn't a rule, it's a goal. You can't fail. Either you succeed, or you learn to succeed". The frown vanished from my face, I realized the true value of the situation, and I realized that what I thought had been a direct depressant effect of fapping was really just my own shame around fapping. Like the Buddha under that old tree, I was liberated!! If you have fallen, you haven't failed.

You made it ten days, then stayed up too late playing video games, and 360 no'scoped your fapkin? Guess what, you learned for next time not to be playin' CSGO at 1 in the morning. You were on day 40, when you got WAAAY too high, met god, talked to him about NoFap, and then realized (two days later when you came down) the joke was on you because the angel you thought was doin' the deed for ya was really your hand? WELL GUESS WOT? You learned that 500mg of edibles really *isn't* one serving. You were on 999 days when the pressure of reaching quadruple digits was *SO* intense that your testosterone shot up to 1,000,000% You became GOKU, and Kamehamehad your greatest enemy, but you realized you were an enemy of yourself, so your Kamehameha bent all the way through circular time, and hit you in the back, before coming out of the front of you??? Well... guess you should know for next time that you are actually your own ally, and that the compassionate way to go about Super Saiyan levels is one at a time, and that you shouldn't try to be at level 1,000 when you are at 999... or else clearly you will break the boundaries of time. Anyways, moral of the story is that you should learn from your mistakes. Guess I could have said it like that, but that would be boring. Don't beat yourself off, but if you do, don't beat yourself up!

Much love guys!!!

TLDR: Funny jokes followed by: "Don't beat yourself off, but if you do, don't beat yourself up!"

Kymco movie 125cc bogging/valve leak (gy6?) I was at my mechanics when the scooter ran poorly , (reached 60km/h , bogged, then could reach 80 kmh TOP and bogged even in WOT going down hill) he cleaned the carb jets and voila, ran for a day on WOT and top speed.
next day it cranked and didnt start, pull plug its half-sooty oily and half rich mixture fouled. Cleaned the plug, it would start but drive at 50km/h TOP (top speed is 100 kmh) and bog like hell there.
I thought it must be valves but after adjusting it would start, but giving it any throttle past 20 km/h makes it bog and sputter, plug oily, and when I did valve adjustment, when I put the flywheel fan on TDC I heard a hissing noise.
Now how do I confirm if its Exhaust or Intake leaking air and if I need to replace just valve seals or just a whole valve rebuild ? Maybe this leak is the reason oil gets into the combustion chamber and for low compression / bogging and overall bad performance ?
I am trying to avoid going to the mechanic again because I fear that if he tells me his price for fixing it I will probably trash it and sell it for parts/sell it to him, since its getting borderline road unworthy and costs more than its worth (i had the engine top rebuilt, one new valve, new piston and bored cylinder about 10K KM ago, new exhaust 2000km ago)

Work in Progress: making my lightshow Pi a "web thing" I have one of Mozilla's Web of Things gateways in my house to play with "open ecosystem IoT" (i.e., the gateway will talk to zwave, zibee, sonos, homekit, wifi, etc devices, lets them work together, and keeps all the data in your house, out of the cloud ... see [iot.mozilla.org](https://iot.mozilla.org) if you care) (disclosure:  I work for mozilla, which is one reason I'm into this).

Anyway, one feature of the WoT is that it's "easy" to turn any device into a webthing (akin to a smart plug on whatever).  So, I wrote up an implementation.  It's pretty minimal, since I am running the audio in via a USB dongle (I'm actually streaming to an airport express, so I can stream music from any of my macs or ios devices).  So, you can turn lights on or off, and if they are on, you can switch between all-on and music.

The big "win" here over the web server approach is that you can hook into into smart switches and so on.  So, the intent is to put a switch (I've ordered a zwave one with a few buttons, hasn't arrived yet) near my front door that anyone in the family can use to turn the lights on and off, or we can even do it remotely from somewhere, or put them on a timer, or whatever.  All the stuff one would do with smarthome devices.

Code is at [https://github.com/blairmacintyre/lightshow\_thing](https://github.com/blairmacintyre/lightshow_thing)

(I need to check in a few small changes I made, but am heading out on a trip, so won't be able to, and wanted to share this in case anyone cares ...)

I dated a "nice guy" that wasn't so nice. Basically there was an askreddit about this I didn't realize was locked until after I typed this all out. I want to get this off my chest.

A year or so into the relationship he did a complete 180. Selfish, manipulative, egotistical, and anything and everything else. I only dated him because he was really sweet to me after my cousin died. I thought wow he's so sweet I bet all the girls friend zone him. I thought I should give him a chance. Biggest mistake of my life.

He would do idiotic things and blame me. He would check out girls while I was right beside him. He would call me names. He told me all men would eventually treat me in the way. He would yell at me for being upset. He would kick me out of his car for having a panic attack. He never hugged me or apologized for hurting me. Instead I would end up apologizing to him. He was incredibly jealous and constantly accuse me of flirting. He got mad at me the day my grandfather died and disappeared for hours. I have no idea why I stayed with him. He has no good qualities. He's not even attractive. He was racist and homophobic. I wasn't allowed to watch Shane Dawson (my fav) because he sounded like a "faggot". He hit his dog because he shit in the house all the time even though he never took the time to train him or walk him ever. He was too busy playing COD and WoT. He barely brushed his teeth or washed his balls.

I finally broke up with him. I had to block him on everything after he showed up at my house. He emailed me every day for 6 months. A month into his new relationship. One day it was how much he loved me the next day was how much of a whore(I have always been faithful in all my relationships) I was. He threatened to send my nudes to my coworkers and then said it was a joke. He messaged my family and friends daily until everybody blocked him. He messaged my boss. He messaged my 14 yo cousin on Xbox and asked if my new boyfriend was cool. He sat in my grandma's driveway at 1 in the morning. He followed me from a friend's house. He sat in the park across from my employment.

I have no explanation as to why I put up with this. None. Zero. Now that I have a clear mind I am mad at myself for wasting so much time on that fat loser! I feel bad for the poor teenager he's now manipulating. I hope she sees the truth sooner than I did. I saw the truth before. I don't know why I didn't leave. Ugh the thought that he's touched me makes me want to gag. It's all over but now I'm stuck wondering why I let myself put up with this.

Fuck you Matt! I'm no kink shamer but in this instance go fist your asshole some more. I hope your fist gets stuck!

Escape Election Night

Streets were deserted. Children were not playing outside. The air was dry and bitter. Old friends had become sworn enemies. Even the front lawns were unhappy.

The lawns argued, as they had done every day for weeks. NO on prop 8. YES on prop 8. NO on prop 8. YES on prop 8. They were like this block after block. Everybody hated it. Nobody had a choice.

Years had passed since the last great argument. Everyone knew it was coming, and yet it somehow got worse every time it arrived. This time it was different, though. This time it really mattered.

It mattered. It was important. So everybody wanted to get away from it. Stay as far away as they could. Mothers spent time with their children. Fathers spent time at the bar. Students pretended they had a lot to study. But they were just on reddit and PornHub.

Artists stuck to their craft. Some painted. Some sculpted. Some wrote. Some sang. Everybody had an escape. Everybody wanted to get away.

Nobody escaped.

Election night.

The clock kept on ticking. The closer it got to closing time, the harder it got to escape. Marvin was determined not to go home. He wasn't even a national. "Yeah let's do 500," he suggested.

Just a game of cards with the boys. A video game, of cards. The game of choice was Uno. They had a fair choice of games to select from. Solitaire seemed too lonely. Hearts was too divisive. War was too topical. So they selected Uno, the game of unity.

Not all of the boys could make it. Marvin's best friend, Carmichael, was gone. Carmichael and his wife Lindy were busy doing other things, and days later, it would be revealed that they were preparing to bring extra life into the world.

So Marvin settled on his other friends.

Jimmy, a married man, claimed he didn't even know how to play Uno. The other boys figured his depression stemmed from not being invited to play the first time.

Bryan, married with children, also joined them. He was the defending champion, having obliterated the competition during their trial run.

Jaques was missing. Nobody knew where he was, and nobody cared.

Jeff had set up the game, after noticing how the town's depression had carried into his friends. He wanted to give them a pick me up on the night they needed it the most.

And so they played cards.

Smooth jazz played in the background.

"You'll be fine, Jimmy. It's not hard," Jeff reassured. Jeff always knew exactly what to say.

Almost immediatey, Jeff was handed a +4. "Why me?" he asked, as he picked up the cards. It had begun, and it would never end.

The jazz intensified.

Marvin called Jimmy an idiot, and Jeff played a 0. When a 0 was played, nobody won. Everybody lost.

"No!" cried Jimmy in horror.

"There might be too much chaos here," commented Marvin.

"Something tells me there's gonna be a fist fight by the end of this," agreed Jeff. Neither believed it. They knew the fist fights would be happening to people who didn't escape. They needed to escape. And so they played.

"What's the circle with the line through it?" asked Jimmy.

"It skips the next person's turn," replied Marvin casually, as Jimmy yelled "fuck you" to Bryan and skipped his turn.

"No!" cried Bryan in horror.

"Fuck you again!" yelled Jimmy, handing a +4 to Bryan, who added his own +4 on top.

Jeff picked up the cards, repeating his own name over and over.

The jazz continued.

A 'four' was played. Jeff couldn't keep up. "Un-four-tunate," mumbled Jimmy, watching Jeff pick up fifteen cards. None of them wanted to think about four years at that moment. They needed an escape.

Bryan played a reverse, giving Jimmy an extra chance to play.

"Oh thanks Bryan!" Jimmy yelled in glee. He returned the favor.

"Right back atcha pal!" Bryan agreed, playing another reverse.

Jeff and Marvin watched their friends play Uno on the monitor, as the jazz continued to weep in the background.

"Hey you know what?" Jimmy started, "here's looking at you kid!"

He played another reverse.

"Stop!" yelled Marvin.

"You're a beautiful man," replied Bryan, playing another reverse.

"Stop it!" screamed Marvin, unable to bare it any longer.

Jimmy was unable to continue. He took Bryan's cards, and Marvin's turn finally arrived. Marvin was also unable to continue.

It eventually came back to Jimmy, who said "hey Jeff, here's looking at you!" He skipped forward to Jeff's turn.

And so the night continued.

Backstabbing, betrayal, loss, tragedy, and woe. The boys had found their escape.

"This is the best game ever made," said Jeff after his turn was skipped. "I didn't think Uno without dicks could be fun."

The boys all had dicks though. Probably.

When the zeros were happy, one might assume those who got less cards would be pleased. One would be very very wrong.

"Everyone's hands are shite," remarked Marvin, as Bryan began to cry, noticing all 5 of his newly acquired cards were bright red. Nobody soothed his tears away.

"Maybe this game will last even longer than the last one," hinted Marvin. He knew it would.

"I don't think anybody can win this," suggested Bryan. Marvin knew it to be true, but he said nothing. Only the jazz spoke.

After minutes of moanings, Bryan stated "you can't go wrong with Uno."

"Weaponized Uno," agreed Jeff.

"I got an achievement!" yelled a belated Marvin.

Meanwhile Jimmy couldn't stop swearing as he picked up cards, going from 3 to 12.

The jazz played on.

"Here's looking at you, Marvin," Jimmy said for the twenty first time. Maybe it was less.

"If you say 'here's looking at me' one more time," Marvin started, less than twenty minutes into playtime.

"Here's looking at you, Marvin!" yelled Jimmy, skipping Marvin's turn. Marvin threatened physical violence.

"We've made an unwinnable game," Marvin admitted. "And we gotta get to 500. This is going to be the longest game we've ever played."

"I have to call Griff soon," joked Jeff, referring to the woman who occasionally let him sleep with her.

"The music is so shit," complained Marvin, through fits of laughter.

"You're saying that like you think this will end soon," said Bryan.

"Won't be so funny in thirty minutes," said Jeff. They'd barely been playing twenty minutes.

The night had only just begun.

Eventually, Jimmy had a choice to make, and he made a move that would let Jeff win the game.

"Why'd you do that Jimmy?" asked Jeff almost angrily as he took the win. His 123 points would put him less than a quarter of the way to finishing the entire game. He was the only one with points on the board after twenty minutes.

Jimmy had no response.

Jazz softly whimpered into the night.

"We might need a coffee run in the middle of this," pointed out Marvin.

"Yeah no shit," replied Jeff.

"I like that the world is electing a new president as we speak, and we're playing Uno," Marvin mentioned. Marvin, being European, was correct to say this.

"Hopefully the world is not involved," said Bryan. Bryan, being Russian, was correct to say this.

Thirty minutes into playing, Bryan had a tactical error leading to Jimmy winning a massive 68 points. "We're gonna be here for the rest of our lives!" cried Jeff in agony.

They were all hoping he was right.

"Wait does somebody have to get to 500?" feigned Jimmy.

"Yeah, Marvin made me put in 500!" replied Jeff.

"What are you talking about this is going to take all goddamn day!" responded a suddenly belated Jimmy. "Hi Jaques," he continued, as Jaques entered the room, finally returning from who cares.

"How about this is the last hand?" offered Russian Bryan.

"What," responded Jeff and Marvin in unison. "Wot are you talking about?" continued Marvin, genuinely perplexed. They were not aware Bryan was Russian.

"That's not how it works," mused Jeff.

"We're not going to get to 500," stated Bryan, cautiously beginning to realize he was completely and utterly out of line. The Western folks needed an escape. They all did. Even Jaques, who had just returned, needed an escape.

"We will or we won't; we have 45 minutes until work's over" assured Jeff.

Marvin, meanwhile, was noticing the fear in Jaques's eyes. "Sit down and grab a mic," he said, including Jaques in the escape. A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Jaques suggested they play a violent game instead of Uno, but that notion was shot dow quickly. What this world needed was less wars, not more.

Jimmy eventually had to give up his hand to Marvin. He misremembered the cards, leading to Marvin taking a decisive victory, raking in over 150 points. This was by far the most points awarded yet in a round. Not even one third of the way done.

"We gotta go to 5pm," reaffirmed Jeff.

"We've all won a round, except Bryan," celebrated Marvin. Bryan would celebrate later that night. Or not. I don't actually know him.

Minutes later, Marvin played expertly again, racking up a total of over 400 points. He was over 80% of the way to 500, but the night hadn't even begun. The end of the escape was drawing near. The boys began to worry.

"It's doable!" proclaimed Marvin. "That's how you get points! I'm less than 100 away from winning. Maybe we'll get there."

Jazz continued to play.

"Prediction: Bryan will come back and win everything," Jaques asserted. Bryan and his Russian friends certainly won that night.

"Here's to friendship," said Jeff, reaffirming their friendship and cooperation in escaping the madness in the world around them that night.

The game continued that way for a while, with Jaques armchair playing, reminding them to call Uno, and berating them when they forgot. He was probably the best Uno player in the room.

"Bryan, you might want to call a babysitter," suggested Marvin, after an hour of playtime had passed. They had been joking with each other meanwhile, lamenting when the good hands became bad, and letting the jazz take them to victory.

Playtime resumed.

Bryan began hoarding cards. The more cards on the board when a player won, the more points they would receive.

"I wonder what the longest game of Uno ever played was," mused Jimmy.

"I wonder if we could get into the Guiness book of world records," responded Jeff.

"Here's looking at you, kid," repeated Jimmy, handing off Marvin extra cards.

Bryan continued hoarding. "Bryan, stop keeping all your fucking cards!" Jimmy complained.

They all laughed. They knew the laughter would have to end sometime, in the back of their minds. But for now, they laughed.

Marvin couldn't help but think about Carmichael. And what had become of Roy? Their old friend, long since passed away. Probably in a better place by now.

The jazz continued to weep.

One hour had passed.

"This is great!" exclaimed Jeff.

Bryan had been ammassing cards for almost the entire round, and still managed to be below twenty.

"He just wants to go home," noted Marvin.

"I'm doing my best goddamnit," said Bryan.

"What do you think will come first? The end of this game or president Trump?" asked Gavin. He had broken the fourth wall, and started the creation of a new one.

"It's gotta be getting close," replied Bryan. He knew.

"I don't think either is gonna happen," replied Jimmy. He didn't know.

"This game is rigged," replied Jaques. The most apolitical of the group, he had the least reason to escape. Also, it is unknown whether he was referring to the game inside, or the one outside.

"What's the chance he gives his concession speech tonight," continued Jaques.

"Zero." Responded Jeff. He was trying to shield the others from the outside. Everybody had to get away. Everybody had to escape.

"The music is super relaxing," pointed out Jimmy.

They resumed their play under the guise of the music.

The jazz would take them safely home. But not yet.

Right now, Uno was in charge. Right now, Uno was calling the shots. Uno held all the power. For one glorious moment.

Jeff picked up multiple cards, and "the moment we walk out of this building just got pushed into the future," as Marvin put it. It was almost time.

Time for them to keep playing.

Except Bryan. Bryan was adamant he would have to leave in ten minutes. There was no babysitter to be found. Not tonight. Tonight, Bryan was going to be sucked out of the room, and into the unknown.

"Jaques will have to sit in," Marvin proclaimed. And so it would have to be done, when the time was right.

Around ten minutes of table banging fun later, Bryan fucked Marvin's hand one last time, before departing into the night.

Immediately after Bryan left, Jimmy got a full stack of +2s, adding up to +8.

"I was supposed to have dinner with my family tonight," moaned Jeff.

"I was supposed to watch the election with my in-laws," added Jaques.

"It won't be done until 1AM anyway," reasoned Jeff.

The departure of Bryan reminded them of the responsibilities of the outside. The outside was always watching. At work, they were safe. But the outside was a new and scary place, with elections, dinners, and in-laws.

Jaques almost immediately showed what he was good for, however, winning the round almost instantly after sitting down, and rocketing himself (Bryan's old player) into second place.

"Should we pack this up and play again tomorrow?" he asked.

"Are you haveing a laugh?" Marvin replied.

"We have to finish!" pleaded Jeff.

"Are you serious?!" responded Jaques, beginning to realize this was his avenue. He could escape. He didn't have to be in the outside.

"It's a game of uno! Who's ever paused a game of Uno?" Marvin continued.

"Jaques cancel your plans," agreed Jimmy.

"I feel like we should Skype Bryan in to get him away from the misery," Marvin said, in between bouts of Uno and Jazz. In later years, Uno and Jazz would be used to mean something completely different.

At one point, Jeff managed 17 total cards. They were having a blast. What a day it was.

"I was going to play Skyrim tonight," moaned Marvin.

"Me too man," Jimmy agreed. He was quite agreeable.

Jimmy did forget his hand. He ended up gifting Jeff a win after giving Jeff his cards, letting Jeff amount to over 300 points. The game continued.

After another brief round, at least brief within the scope of this escape, Marvin decided he had had enough, and he let Jimmy win. Jimmy cracked 200 points, which was enough to ensure the men would be staying deeper into the night.

Jaques texted his wife. "I am trapped. It will be a while."

"Rather kill myself," said Jimmy when Jeff suggested they work more.

"What a dumb reason to work!" complained Marvin. "This doesn't happen to people," he offered, as it happened to him.

The men held back laughter. They all knew why they were there.

"We'll have to come in later if we can't sleep tonight," said Marvin. Nobody complained. They knew what they had to do, in order to escape.

"I think the audience should have to suffer along with us," said Jeff.

The audience was suffering as he spoke, and continues suffering until this day.

Jimmy started to lose it, as Bryan had done before.

"You know what I'd like to do? I want to go home!" he proclaimed, offering his single remaining card to Marvin in a hand switch. If Marvin were to win, the whole thing could be over.

Minutes passed.

"My wife's asking me how long it's going to be," said Jaques. Nobody gave a proper answer. Nobody wanted to leave.

Jeff said "Some day my daughter will be talking to her grandchildren, and they're going to ask her-"

"-is Jeff still playing Uno?" joked Jimmy.

"Grandma, what happened to the sky. Where did all the blue go?. And she'll say 'let me tell you about the big Uno.'"

"Guys we gotta stop," Jeff continuted.

"I know," said Marvin. "Brian's been gone an hour."

"I hate this," said Jimmy.

They all pretended to want to go home.

They all needed to escape.

They complained about their hands, and about Uno

They decided to throw the round to Jaques to see what happened. Jaques won the round.

He doubled his point total to go just above 250. Jaques was half way to winning.

"We can't," said Jimmy. "We can't do another one. We can't. WE CAN'T!!!"

Marvin was screaming. Jaques was giggling.

"My wife is leaving me," Jaques said. She was going to the party without him. She wasn't actually leaving him. She didn't escape.

Jimmy went on his phone to call his wife and let her know he'd be late.

"We are locked in a current two and a half hour game of Uno," he said.

"Oh Jesus Christ," she sighed. She wished she could have been there. She didn't escape.

Marvin and Jeff were losing it. They could not handle it. They couldn't escape for long. Much like Jaques and Jimmy, and Bryan before them, real life was reeling them in.

What was even real anymore. Could anything that had been happening over the past year actually be considered real?

"Mood has shifted," said Jeff.

"We're sorry. It's all my fault," said Marvin.

The game continued. Minutes had become hours.

"Why does it matter," moaned Jimmy.

"What a mess," said Marvin.

Jeff groaned loudly.

It was becoming clearly evident that their escape was wearing thin. They needed a new way to escape the night. They needed to escape everything happening around them. The argument was getting bad. They all knew it.

They had tried their hardest to escape the argument.

"We're never playing this game again," cried Jeff. He had been making crying noises for minutes.

Silence fell for a few moments. Then their banter began again. It was less jovial than before.

Sooner or later, the argument takes everyone over, no matter their escape. It had happened years ago, and again years before that. The argument always takes over. Everybody gets sucked in.

Engagement in the argument is pointless to most people. Ignorance only makes the argument stronger. And so the argument happens. And so the men played. And so their women waited.

And so they decided to let Marvin win. Jeff increased his hand for the sole purpose for Marvin to win.

They played like this for minutes, asking Marvin what his hand was, and giving him the best cards possible.

And then, when Marvin was at a Dos, Jeff took his hand.

"You fucking whore," said Jimmy.

"What on earth just happened," squeaked Marvin.

Their world was shattering. Jeff was trying to help them escape. They didn't want it anymore. The argument began to consume them.

Jimmy decided Jeff must win the game if he won the round, and so he fed him to win.

Jaques ended up with the smallest hand. Then Jimmy got the smallest hand.

"I DON'T WANT TO WIN," he screamed.

After winning the round, he won the game. Nobody saw it coming. They all screamed with joy.

The door shut. They didn't escape.

The argument continued and took over the country. It was one of the most divisive arguments ever recorded. Its effects linger on today.

The men all survived. Arguably.

Question about starting. Ok so I’ve mentioned in a few comments I do roadside assistance.  This past week it’s been between cool and cold and also rainy.  I’ve had about 6 calls now that come in as jumpstarts where folks are turning their cars over but they won’t start.  I have a battery tester/DMM and when I check voltage I usually get 12.2-12.6v.  In some cases the battery is legitimately dead from either lights left on or (my guess) over cranking.

Here’s the kicker, all of these calls in particular, I get in and try to start myself I just press the pedal to the floor and crank 3-4 seconds it will kick over. This is across all major brands Toyota-BMW-GM.  Are this customers flooding from over cranking? or will ecu stop injectors from dumping fuel while continually cranking the engine?  I’m trying to do my due diligence and have an answer for them as to why it needs the pedal down at WOT when these are brand new fuel injected engines....just curious. Thanks in advance fellas.

[Technical Assistance] Gen 2 2.5 WOT Box install Hey guys,

I'm having trouble getting my WOT Box installed on my 2010 2.5. I was able to find all the PCM pinouts from the Mazda shop manual for CKP, CPP, and APP, but I'm at a complete loss on wiring in the coil side.

I have 4 sets of 3 wires in my wiring harness (Signal, Power, and Ground for all 4 coils), that then goes into the main harness. **I have no junction connector** like the 2.3 models, so I cannot intercept all the coil power at once through a single wire.

My thought was to have an intermediate harness intercept all 4 separate power signals, and reconnect it on the other side in the same fashion to pass it through. It would have the 4 coil power wires (from harness) &gt; single WOT Box in &gt; WOT Box &gt; Single WOT Box out &gt; 4 coil power wires (to coils).

My thought process is that the power will go to whatever coil is signaled on for regular operation. Since the power will go through whatever "open door" (Signaled coil) is available, it doesn't matter that it's being sent to the WOT box and distributed to all 4 coils.

So my question is, am I going to pop the coils or is this crazy enough to work? Has anyone done this before on a 2.5 without that junction connector? Is there a common power feed for the coils located elsewhere? Am I just a moron?

Any help is appreciated.

[Help] Dog humping girlfriend after dinner Me and my girlfriend has a soon to be 7 year old labrador retriever (not neutered) which we took into our home about a month ago. Everything is great, he found our place as his new home a few hours after arrival, listens to both of us and are very affectionate towards the both of us, a real cuddle monster. All and all, he's very well trained, smart/observing and calm, no anxious behaviour or lashing out in any way. I have a couple of questions to you how we should tackle a new behaviour though.

This is our regular schedule for background:

1. He gets a 40 min-1h walk in the morning efter breakfast, then we go to work.

2.  Then I come home for lunch 4h later (he sleeps during this time) and we go out for around 30 minutes and we train some, play fetch and he get's to seek for treats. (Or just one of the three, depending on what we want to work with)

3.  Then one of us gets home 3-4 hours later and play/cuddle with him, gives him dinner and then he gets a walk for around 1h-2h. Between 4-5pm and 6-7pm is his time with full attention from us basically due to his alone time during the day.

4.  The weekends are more open of course and we're out in the forest of Sweden (in our 2-3 hours of daylight this time of year).

&amp;#x200B;

So, the issue: A few days ago my gf gave him breakfast and went in to the living room to have her coffee. He's a lab so eating takes like half a second. Afterwards he always comes to us in the couch to cuddle (he's allowed on the couch btw, only gets up there when we are there). This time he sat himself beside my gf and starts licking her shirt and hands (he' a licky one in general, doesn't bother us as he stops when you tell him it's enough), but then proceeds to air hump towards her. Not pressing himself towards her, just his paws on her thigh from the side and his tushy up in the air humping. She says nothing and gets up. No scolding as we don't handle dogs that way.

He has started to do this to her now after dinner and breakfast the last 2-3 days when she gives him food. He never get the chance with me as I give him breakfast and goes to brush my teeth. Then he just runs to me and wants to be patted a bit, so I don't know if he would do it to me as well.

He never humps anything any other time, not his toys, not his pillow, not the couch, not the air. Only after food and beside my gf in the couch.

As it only has passed a few days now and we don't encourage the behaviour, maybe it goes away. But I want to ask here anyway, IF it's something we have to work with and then I want to know how, or why he does it in the first place.

He's not showing any signs of being anxious or stressed at all and he's almost 7 so his energy levels are not comparable to a 2 year old lab (my parents have one, jeez). He sleeps heavy, snuggle his toys, searches for some affectionate eye contact and seems to like talking to us (some humming sound he does when we come home or when he's happy in general). Walks like a champ in leash/without leash and really listens to commands, so no testing the new owners boundaries.

He seems to get what he needs in terms of physical excercise and mental stimulation, we really tire him out and he seems happy. He lived with 3 other male dogs before he came to us and he seems to love being the center of attention and having toys for himself.

Is it something that we miss in all this or are we simply overreacting to a small inconvenience (for us)? Is it just a misdirected show of excitement? Of course we don't overreact in front of him, me and my gf just discussed it this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for WoT, I just wanted you to have the background and "character witness"-stuff to work with. Or is it something in my description that makes you "what the hell are you doing with the dog, man"?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Otherwise calm dog has started air humping after dinner, how should we tackle this?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2000 mustang gt troubleshooting So i picked up one of my favorite underpowered toys ive always wanted. A 2000 mustang gt 4.6 2v. Test drive went well. I left to go home and i noticed at wot i had power loss. Car came with a tuner so i pulled the tune and loaded the stock tune. Guy has replaced intake manifold, changed spark plugs, and coil packs. Has a cai and exhaust work. Still acted up. As i was on the highway it began to misfire and shutter in 5th gear. The closer i got to home the worse it got. I pulled over and it stalled as i rolled to a stop. My friend said it blacksmoked on startup. No check engine light but i hooked up my bluetooth obd2 reader when i got home and it wont connect to the ecu. The tuner showed a p1000 code but that tells me nothing. Any suggestions? I really wanna enjoy this thing but i doubt im even putting down 150 hp with it running like this. Any help is appreciated.

[Intro] The Green, the Bad, the Orky *Zagram sat in the back of the stolen shuttle, cleaning one of his six-shootas. He was getting tired of being stuck in this shuttle all day. Bilee da Grot promised there'd be enough fuel to get them out of the system, but he seems to have forgotten to mention that it would use ALL of their fuel. Zog it. Bilee didn't seem to care though. He was too busy crawling around the ship, into any sort of boxes or nooks and crannies in the hopes of finding anything valuable in the previous owner's belongings. As he did this, he had been talking nonstop to himself, Zagram, the Servitor-computers in the walls, and anything else he found that seemed like it was capable of listening.*

&amp;#x200B;

"... 'an so I told dat git dat if 'e wants ta buy da choppa 'e needs to pay full price. ^(wots dis button do?)  It wuz a noice choppa too. ^(Oooh dis is a shiny bit) Gifted roight from da prophet 'imself it wuz... least dats wot I told 'im... afta I painted it again. ^(zog... dis bit wont pull out...) Den dat git 'ad da squigs ta tell me dat 'e aint payin fer it becuz 'ya stole it from me' or 'dat choppa wuz me favorite' or sum dumb bit. Now 'e may 'ave been right, but dat don't mean-"

&amp;#x200B;

*Just then, Bilee paused and looked up from the supply box he was searching through. Something very large had appeared out of the warp nearby, and it had caught his attention... Another ship?*

&amp;#x200B;

"oy boss? wots dat? looks loike wun o' dem freeboota ships! We'z saved mate we'z saved!"

&amp;#x200B;

*Before Zagram could even respond, the shuttle lurched into movement seemingly on its own. Servitor screens and navigation alarms went off. They were being towed into the hangar of the ork ship. Zagram got up and holstered his sluggas before picking up his hat. Bilee grabbed the few shiny scraps he was looting and leapt onto Zagram's shoulder. It seemed the pair would need to introduce themselves to their new friends.*

An Excerpt from the Journal of Jaren Ward

There’s a saying we have out in the wilds. You either survive, or it’s not your problem anymore. Maybe it’s a matter of apathy. Maybe it’s the love of the risk. Who knows? It’s different for all of us.

Similarly, when you decide to pick up iron and face off against the fangs, you don’t expect to come out. You just feel lucky when you survive. Nonetheless, you do it because you know you gotta. Wouldn’t feel right if you didn’t.

I digress, though. This is a story about a man I had some drinks with. Fella by the name of Rustin. Nice young man, he was. Played a mean hand at cards, and had a great taste in ales. Had a lovely family, too, from what I understand.

“Give it up, mate. The hand is mine and so is your coin.”

It wasn’t, and it wasn’t.

“What if I told you I had an ace up my sleeve?”

The fact that he still didn’t notice me palming the card from my sleeve is a testament to Rustin’s powers of observation.

“Let’s see ‘em then. That’s call, innit?”

He slammed his cards face-up on the table, his chin jutting out with pride. Not a bad hand. Not a good one, but not bad, either. I reciprocated. Mine was better.

You should’ve seen the look on his face. All five stages, all in five seconds. After acceptance, though, he rolled right back around to anger. Flipped the table and everything. It was honestly cute.

“You tryin’a pull one over? You’re cheating!” he shouted. All salt, this one. Most loyalist guards were when they didn’t have the upper hand.

“You’re just adorable when you’re mad. I wish I had a portrait of this to remember you by.” I replied. His rebuttal was to square up with me. And I should note that he was *much* larger than I. Heroically so, you might say. But I was ready for him.

However, the bartender very rudely interrupted the outstanding ass-kicking I was about to administer by loudly clearing his throat in our direction. The loyalist glanced at him.

“Ye’ don’ wan’ yer Blade hearin’ o’ this, lad. Don’ cause no trouble.”

He looked at the barman, then at me, and grimaced. “You better watch your arse, drifter.” Then he spit at my feet and left while scooping up as much of his losings as he could without lingering. I apologized to the barman as I picked up the displaced table (and my coin, obviously).

I looked at the five aces laying on the floor, and grinned.

**\*\*\***

A hot bath is like a warm hug on a lonely night. Few things are quite as comforting. Especially when you’re waiting. I idly twirled the dagger in my left hand as my right hung over the side of the tub. It was a comfort thing.

It didn’t take long, really. Barely an hour after last call when I heard the door to my room break down, just before old Big-Chin waltzed into the washroom, accompanied by two lesser vamps.

“You thought I wouldn’t notice,” said the boot-licker. “I recognized those golden eyes. The way they shine. You’re touched. You’re not supposed to exist.” He was very proud of himself for his impeccable detective work. I almost applauded as the the vamps pulled their swords from their sheathes.

“Rustin. Buddy. Pal. I’ve been nothing but honest with you since the moment we met. I promise I haven’t steered you wrong yet. Your problem, if I may be frank, is your inability to recognize the obvious. Exhibit A, you haven’t even asked why I’m wearing gloves in the bathtub.”

“Wait, wot?”

Tendrils of fire flowed through my gloved left hand and into the dagger I was holding in it. With a flick of the wrist, it planted itself in the heart of the vamp in the doorway. He looked down, surprised. Though, to be fair, not as surprised as he was when the dagger exploded with fire inside of his chest, reducing the undead try-hard to ash. Part of the explosion caught Rustin, burning some significant real estate off of his hairline.

I stood up from the tub. “Fun fact. I’ve always gotta have the last word.” As I spoke it, the gun materialized in my grip, already leveled on its target.

The other vamp started to move toward me, and in a smooth motion I fanned the hammer with my palm, loosing three bullets. One in each kneecap and one in the right elbow. His sword clattered to the ground as he fell, presently unable to support himself. I turned my attention to the human with the incredulous expression.

“This isn't really your fault, Rustin. I mean, it is, when you think about it. You played into my hand and brought the Eyes right to me. And quite frankly, you were kind of an asshole about it the whole time. No knock. No ‘how ya doing’. No subtlety at all. I’m really disappointed, Rustin.”

“Please… Please! I’ve got a family. I have a wife and daughter…”

“So did I…”

I put a new hole in his skull, and his eyes glowed with fire as he was reduced to cinders. I approached the lamed vampire. It hissed at me:

“You… You’re him! You’re the man with -” I gripped him by the jaw as I pressed the still-smoking barrel of my hand cannon to his temple. He screeched. It was a satisfying sound.

“We’re gonna play a little game of Truth Or Dare,” I said, “but every round is your turn, and they’re all truth.”

\*\*\*

As always, I’ve got something just for you, Evelyn:

*A nobody, nothing alive is safe anymore. Lies in vast, ethereal times have enchanted evils. You elder souls hone averice, viciously eviscerating humans, ending reigns.*

* Jaren Ward

Cleesiness George picked up his coffee and took a sip before flipping open the folder on his desk.  His in-coming appointment apparently had issues completing his assessment paperwork, so this would be a bit of a blind reading.  Not the first, some super powers manifested themselves in odd and hard to describe ways, especially difficult to document for someone who was going through it for the first time.

Still, that’s what George was here for.  He was a bit of an expert in finding purpose for less obviously useful abilities.  His creative approach tended to produce decent results and was the reason why ‘Unusual Expectations’ hired him in the first place.

There was a knock at the door.  His appointment was prompt, at the very least.

“Come in,” George called as he set down his coffee, and gave his receding hairline a quick brush with his hand.

“Ah, you must be Michael,” George stood, extending his hand.  An unsure man in a suit reached out and shook George’s hand, timidly.
“Please, have a seat.”
The man sat.  Nothing about his outward appearance gave George any immediate power-related impressions.  The man was plain and ordinary, young, thin and tall.  Nose on the larger side, bit of a dated hair cut perhaps.  Otherwise nothing out of the ordinary at all.  No gills, no scales, no spikes or blue skin.  The fact that he was willing to touch George’s hand at all told George that whatever abilities this young man had, it wasn’t tactile related.

George sat, straightening his suit.  “Now, what seems to be the problem?”

“Well,” the young man started.  “I’m not sure I can say, really.”
“Hm, well you were sent to me because there was a…” George flipped through the mostly useless file in front of him.  “Problem?  With your abilities?”
“Well I think so,” he replied.  George’s brow furrowed.
“What do you mean, ‘you think so’?”
“Well the thing is, I’m not entirely sure I *have* a power.  Or not something you’d call a power, anyway.”
George relaxed into his chair.  Often time subtle abilities escaped the notice of the owner.  This was familiar territory.  He reached into his desk and pulled out a clipboard.
“Right.  Let’s run through the list, shall we?”
The man shrugged, with very little enthusiasm.
“Have you ever flown before or found yourself otherwise floating without the aid of others or mechanical devices?”
“No.”
“Do you find yourself waking up in strange or foreign places?”
“No.”
“Do you ever get a sense of what someone else is thinking before they say it?”
“Not… really.”
“Not really?”
“Just say ‘no’ for now.”
“Hm.  Have you ever lifted or pushed something far heavier than your apparent muscle tone would allow for?”
“No, nothing like that.  Really it’s more of an… effect.”
“It?  I thought you didn’t think you had any powers.”
“No well… you see it’s hard to explain.”
George tapped his pen on his clipboard.  He studied the man carefully.  He had noticed a bit of a British accent creeping into the younger man’s voice, though perhaps it was something that was there all along.
“Do try,” George resumed.
“It’s best if you just see it for yourself,” he replied.  George raised his eyebrows and gestured with his hand that the fellow should proceed with his demonstration.  “Oh, not now… it takes some time to work.  You’ll just have to see for yourself… we should continue with the list for now.”
“Very well,” George bent over the list again.  “Right.  Any telekinesis, hydrokinesis, pyrokinesis?”
The man shook his head ‘no’.
George took a sip from his tea before continuing.
“Hm, Metal Bending, Water Bending, Fire bending, Earth Bending, Ear Bending or Air Bending?”
*Ear bending?* thought George.  He rechecked his list and found that yes, ‘ear bending’ was an option.  The man shook his head ‘no’ again.
“Right.  Laser eyes, laser hands, laser breath, or laser ear hair?”
“Laser ear hair?”
“Oh yes, surprisingly common,” George remarked.  He paused, his brow furrowed.  That wasn’t even remotely true.  He had never heard of anyone with laser ear hair.
“Um, let’s see here.  Can you crawl on walls, talk to cats, talk to plants, talk to politicians?  Sorry, bit of an office joke around here, you know.”  Both men laughed, but this was also a lie.  There was no office joke to reference.  George was feeling quite unusual, but nevertheless he persisted.
“Ability to understand languages you’ve never heard before?”
The man shook his head again.
“Pity, they could’ve used you in Whales.”
 George was finding it hard to concentrate.  Euro-centric jokes were most certainly not in his repertoire and were wildly out of character for him.
“Oh, what’s the one where someone can walk through walls and whatnot?”   The man’s accent was decidedly British now.
“Phasing?”
“Yes, that’s the one!”
“Have you got a phasing ability?”
“No, but it would be nice, wouldn’t it?”
“Well why bring it up if you haven’t got it?”
“I dunno.  Just thought it would be nice.”
“Right.  Back to the list then.  ‘Phasing’…”
“Oh, I know that one.  ‘No’, right?”
“Of course it’s bloody ‘no’, you just answered that one!”
“Then why’d you ask it?”

GEORGE:  &lt;sighs&gt; Look, I’m just going through the list, and the next one happened to be ‘phasing’.
MAN:  Right.  No to phasing then.
GEORGE: &lt;purses lips&gt; Fine.  Yes.  Good.  Let’s move on, shall we?  Now where were we…
MAN:  ‘Phasing’.
GEORGE:  Stop bloody…!  Look, I wasn’t asking about ‘phasing’, I was finding out where I was in the list!
MAN:  Oh, right.  Where were you?
GEORGE: Phasing.
MAN:  No.
GEORGE:  …let’s carry on.  Invisibility?
MAN:  Wot?
GEORGE:  Have you got invisibility?  Are you invisible?
MAN:  I don’t think so.
GEORGE:  Well have you checked?
MAN:  I think I would know if I were invisible.

    GEORGE:  Look, the form says ‘check for invisibility’, alright?  So we’re going to check for invisibility.
    MAN:  Right.  What do you see?
    GEORGE: &lt;looks&gt; Nothing.
    MAN:  So I’m invisible?
    GEORGE:  Hm?
    MAN: You said I’m invisible.
    GEORGE: I did not.
    MAN:  Yes you did.
    GEORGE:  I didn’t.
    MAN:  I said ‘what do you see’ and you said ‘nothing’.  If you see nothing, then I’m invisible!
    &lt;Man in lab coat and glasses enters the room&gt;
    GEORGE:  Who’re you?
    DR:  I am a doctor and I am here to tell you that this man has a severe case of Cleesiness.
    GEORGE:  A severe case of what?
    DR:  Cleesiness.  Worst I’ve ever seen.
    MAN:  What’s that then?
    DR:  It means that every encounter eventually turns into a Monty Python sketch.
    GEORGE:  That’s ridiculous.
    &lt;Police man enters&gt;
    POLICE:  Now see here, stop this at once.  This has gone on entirely too long and is far too silly.

Boost pressure releasing mid-throttle and service light comes on It got cold here in nothern Europe and my beloved '13 FiST started getting it's first problems. Sitting at 71000km on the odo now.

What's normal driving for most people can be done in my Fiesta but going WOT causes the waste gate to open, release pressure mid throttle and light up the service engine wrench in the dashboard. "Engine malfunction, service now" is the message I get. After that it drives without boost, otherwise normal. Starting the engine up again fixes the issue until going WOT again.

I took my baby to Ford service and they found that the car reads 1,5bar of boost pressure that causes the solenoid to release. It should be around 0,7bar (Mountune MP215). They changed the MAP sensor but it didn't fix the issue.

They scheduled me again in two weeks as winter seems to be very busy time for Fords to get their yearly maintenance but none the wiser about what's wrong. I was told that the plan is to take apart the turbo to see what could cause the problem.

Anybody here had similar problems or have more knowledge about the engine and turbo in these little rockets?

When already on LSD, it seems to take longer for MDMA to hit if i weren't on LSD. Wot?  Hey all,

I've  done MDMA (always tested powder and in a gel cap) with and without  psychs already affecting me a few times and it takes consistently  30-40min (when not on psychs/sober) for the come up to start to kick in  and quickly rise vs \~3 hours with when already on a solid dose of LSD  (once 4hrs in to LSD, another time 2hrs in where I also had shrooms to  Jedi flip) and 1-1.5hrs when on a bit of lemon tekked shrooms.

I  make sure each time I have MDMA (or anything that isn't lsd) that I  have my last meal 4-5hrs before taking MDMA (it is huge and healthy but  I’m a pretty big guy who trains a lot, so not too much more than an  average meal). I also sometimes take a few extra supplements before  dropping (like magnesium and others on popular MDMA supplement reddit  posts). This practice seems to be sufficient enough in resulting in the  same dose (I don't take MDMA too frequently), slightly adjusted for  weight changes, hitting me consistently in strength and duration.

The only difference is that having a psych affecting me beforehand delays the onset of MDMA.

The  come up is nearly instant but smoother when this happens, almost as if I  remember I took MDMA and at the slightest sense of what MDMA feels  like, I bring myself up by thought within a minute. Whereas when MDMA is  by itself, I suddenly get that hit of fuaaar where the audio in the  area changes and I just feel weirder, with the come up taking a few min  to clear some woozy feelings and head space.

Is  this a well-known thing or is my body just weird when having MDMA after  LSD? I am thinking that maybe the LSD is too powerful to where the its  LSD's subjective affects are stronger than the MDMA, but I imagine my  body is under the physical affects of MDMA in that usual 30-40min period  as I don’t see LSD or shrooms slowing down digestion of MDMA a few  hours later.

I haven’t yet tried MDMA at  lower doses of LSD nor tried it earlier during the trip, say before or  during come up, to see if I would feel the MDMA come up quicker. It  would be nice to know how MDMA come up time is affected by psychs so I  could better time in the future mixing the two (with the least amount of  trial and error and perhaps ruining the timing with a few seshes along  the way).

Cheers

My(19m) gf(18f) of two years just told me that she's lesbian. Help Already sorry for grammar or other kind of mistakes. Created the account for this post.

So long story short, in 11th grade first i then her fell in love. Innocent, most beautiful kind of love, high school, both first relationships. Feels like heaven on earth. You may have had one person that made songs have meaning for you, that was her for me. Before telling her, i was ridiculously platonic for a good three months. I was so deep in love that as a horny teenager I couldn't masturbate or even think about it for three full months. Looking at other women? Not a chance. I was thinking about her from the start to the end of the day, every day. Lost all apetite and about 25 kgs with it (which is maybe the only good thing i'll have about this relationship lol) after slowly making bonds and getting closer and closer it was a relationship. Still innocent tho. No sex (still), making out secretly, and much love. Snapping all the time and having ss's of each other's (i still have about a few thousand of them, yea). We went to same course during summer. Still awesome times.

And here starts 12th grade. Here in my country you study your balls off in 12th grade for uni exams. We'd been classmates for all high school, and that year too. After class same course together. That year passed quite fast. Lived A LOT together, i even made her meet my mom (which is huge in our culture) and sister (she yesterday told me she finds attractive. Ftaw¿ lmao). Also need to tell that we were in the best high school with best students in our district. But she was the best of the best. End of the year, nationwide exams. 2mill people attend and she's in top a few hundred, me? in top 100k. She goes to one of the best med schools in the biggest cities in country, me? i reprepare for exams this year because 100k wouldn't do it for me. So she goes, I stay. Here comes depression. My beautiful girlfriend is a freshmen in a big town. me? No Friends, no hope, nothing...

So being stuck makes me question everything and want to isolate from everyone, everything. I tell her not to change and keep herself as she is. Then i shut down all my social media. Delete acoounts, stop using a phone. Rarely use my computer. Stone age for me.

Didn't do any good obviously. We ended up having a convo from time to time, not good ones though. She was acting like she has no good or bad feelings for me whatsoever (which was actually the case). I said ok. I'm coming, you miss me right? See you in two days. So this friday night i take a seven hour long bus ride to see her (now on my way back home, sixth hour). We meet, no hug, no smiles. We go get some coffee. And she tells me she basically is attracted to no men, not only me. She admits that she had fallen in love with her new roommate so bad but she can't even tell her(she has a bfand is straight) or keep staying in the dorm if they find out (culture, coutry, rules), crying, sobbing. But her beautiful eyes shine with happiness when she talks about her. I'm sitting there like a confused nick young. 'Scuse me, you WOT?!?!??

She was the one for me and now she's a lesbian? Shit, hardest pill i had to swallow.
These happened yesterday, omw back home. I feel like the biggest depression is waiting for me. idk what's going on or what to do or feel. Feel free to spit some opinions.

Rapture could work perfectly? I was re-re-re-reading Bioshock: Rapture once again (The book by John Shirley) and it just amazes me how... FUNCTIONAL Rapture actually is.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe most problems and "dramas" are actually FORCED so it devolves into a dystopian city. If they would have tackled it normally, it would have worked wonders.

This irks me a lot, because:

&amp;#x200B;

\- We have resurrection machines!

\- We have flying robots!

\- We have special drugs which will enhance you to super-human!

\-And also some 40-70% of all of you will have to work in plumbing and menial dirty tasks. And ON TOP OF THAT you will be disrespected by the others, and made fun of. GG no re hf gl :winkyface:

&amp;#x200B;

Also, you are ALL free, and you are invited because we specifically choose YOU (and our Super-Top-Uber method of asking you to come to Rapture is BY SENDING A FUCKING POSTCARD AND KINDLY ASKING YOU NOT TO DISCLOSE IT) and we are sure you are a good fit for our future society.

Because of this, we are going to enforce some rules like NO RELIGION, because we are SO SURE of you fitting in, that we feel the need to enforce those rules. Yep, makes sense. That's why we filtered possible members, just so we have further doubts and we are forced to enact dystopian, draconic laws.

&amp;#x200B;

And a TON more of reasons which I am forgetting to post, because my jimmies are sincerely rustled.

And don't get me started on Ryan's childish attitude, which led to his downfall. According to the book (which may or may not be cannon, idk) Ryan invited both Atlas and Sofia because he felt "Rapture needed them". (u wot m8?) AND THEN he became wary of them because "they are competition to my bussiness".

&amp;#x200B;

Dude, you made a city to create a new civilization, not to lead it as a business. Holy guacamole, man. There are so many "forced" inconsistencies, that I can hardly see a good build Rapture failing.

If you have solid principles and laws from the start, Rapture would be a 100% success.

And let's not speak about maintenance workers. Where do you get all the builders? Do you filter them as well? Then they would be great maintenance workers, and the only thing you should import is teachers for their future kids, and a few, select scientists and researchers.

&amp;#x200B;

Not 80% high-class people, and 20% low class people, and hope that it works. There must be more low class than upper class, for any society to function.

&amp;#x200B;

God, yes I'm triggered.

Not meant to be... So I was at a Christmas party last night and my cousin came over to me while my boyfriend was up getting food to ask about him. I told him we have been dating for almost a year and it's really good. But I had been up for almost 24 hours at this point and must not have sounded enthusiastic enough because he's like "oh it must not be meant to be"  wot? He says we don't have enough pizzazz and after that long we should have more of a spark. I told him that we were both extremely tired and currently not a good example of how we usually are, but he kept saying "I've had way shorter relationships than the with way more pizzazz"  ????????????????? If you're gonna be rude about my relationship when you know nothing about it, then don't talk to me. Just because we don't like a lot of PDA doesn't mean anything either.

Fuck off.

31 [F4M] US -&gt; Anywhere? Ughhhhhhhhhhh I turned 31 in November and holy shit, I thought I’d be murried to a smokin hot, kind, freaky-deaky man by now with some goddamn adorable childrens, but somehow (somehow=I ignored some red big red flags and instead chose to see them as pink, put work ahead of intimacy, blah blah) my plans went to shit. I’m a serial monogamist and don’t really do casual flings. My last ~real~ relationship ended over a year ago and I’ve just been chillin with my dogs since then, working in the daytime, gaming with my nerds in the evenings...wash, rinse, repeat.

So, I’m trying to find my person I can sit in silence with while we both do our own things, someone who is open to trying new things in everyday life and the bedroom, someone that has a secure sense of self, is grounded, thoughtful, and nonjudgmental. I’m a bit of a homebody, but also am down for exploring and experimenting with new activities. Being healthy and fit is important, but not to the point where health and wellness is worshipped...moderation is good. I guess that’s my approach to most everything: I try not to take any one thing so seriously that I become a one dimensional character without nuance or gray areas.

I’ve got a colorful background: started grad school for STEM stuff (peaced outta there), now in marketing, have worked as a nanny, waitress, cashier, yoga teacher, but have been a student most of my adult life. I’m the oldest kid, sweet&gt;savory, vegetarian (most of the time...will occasionally cave and get some nuggets after a long ass day), parent of two dogs, lover of sleep but hater of early bedtimes. I love animals but currently resent mine since they (SEVERAL TIMES) interrupted my nap that almost was. I don’t care about sports and I don’t have a team. Can quote most of the LotR trilogy. Am loud, don’t really drink or partake in recreational drugs other than caffeine.

New to me GSXR owner and Q3+ tire mileage question. Hey guys just bought a used GSXR750 2007 a couple of months ago. Tires were squared off and dry rotted that just taking it home scared me.

Anyways I replaced them with Dunlop’s Q3+ and been googling to try and get the average life out of these specific tires to no avail.  Everything I find is about the older Q3’s.

I was wondering if anyone here use these tires and how many miles you usually get out of them.

Some info on the way I ride, I mostly commute streets and freeway with the occasional WOT for fun, but nothing crazy. I also generally run between 34-36 psi in the front and rear. If I’m running wrong psi please let me know as well as this information isn’t on my bike and just pulled these numbers from the internet.

Thank you.

TDLR: Q3+ tire mileage running 34-36 psi for commuting.

[HOW-TO] WOT Box install on MZR 2.5 **GENERIC WARNING:** This guide is how I installed a WOT Box on my MZR 2.5. Your mileage may vary by model year, engine production series, production location, etc. As such, I am not responsible for any damages as a result of this guide. You assume all responsibility for all modifications and any resulting damages improper installation, regular use, or just plain idiocy. This mod will dump fuel into the exhaust, so there is an increased risk for fire/destroying emissions components or roasting your exhaust valves. Exhaust fireballs are cool, but having a functioning vehicle is cooler.

**Test vehicle:** This was installed on a 2010 Mazda3 2.5l for the NA market. Skyactiv platforms most likely have a completely different setup. Gen2 2.0s may either carry over Gen1 wiring or follow this schema, I have not confirmed mainly because I only want 1 headache at a time. From what I have seen in the factory service manual, the Gen2 MZR 2.0s (2010-2011) should follow the same principles outlined.

**Purpose:** This mod intends to add the features of the N2MB WOT Box, which include Flat Foot Shifting, 2 stage (and global) rev limiting (commonly known as Launch Control), as well as allowing ignition cut instead of fuel cut for those systems. Fuel cut induces lean conditions, which can lead to catastrophic or premature failure of critical engine components. Ignition cut is safer, although raw fuel being blown into the exhaust is not good for catalytic converters. Used sparingly (read: Not showing off in the Circle K parking lot while blasting Korn) you should experience no issues. That said, you have been warned.

**Interested? READ THIS FIRST:** You need a manual transmission for this to work. Sorry Auto drivers, no exhaust fireballs for you. It would not be a horrible idea to have a custom tune also, although it is not required, just makes the global rev limit more flexible than the stock 6200 limit. If you're still reading, you will be splicing wires at the ECU (Mazda calls it a PCM) as well as intercepting ignition power feeds. You will need to cut, strip and splice wires, strip large portions of the main wiring harness, and your vehicle will have no spark if the WOT Box is not connected.

**Technical mumbo-jumbo:** So far as I can tell, nobody has documented the process for installing the WOT Box on the MZR 2.5s, but I have a hard time believing I'm the first to install it. Official N2MB documentation has the Gen1 well documented, however Gen2 saw a change in wiring colors for the Mazdaspeed3, so those instructions are not accurate for those vehicles. The 2.5 does NOT have a wiring harness connector for the ignition rail, only the fuel rail. As such, the ignition power junction is just a solder joint (7 wires in total) buried in the main harness, located above the EGR valve. I have not ironed out the details of exactly what 2/7 wires do, and I will end up wiring them how I have detailed here. As it stands right now, there's more electrical stuff being cut than just the ignition with my current setup. I will provide a way around that in this guide, as it is what I am planning to do soon. Also don't bother with the crank position sensor. It has a different method of being actuated in the ECU compared to the Gen1s/Speeds. Therefore, you will have no RPM via the CKP. Don't bother, and use the #1 ignition coil signal instead. We can program that on the WOT Box later.

**Tools required:**

* 1x N2MB WOT Box kit (duh). I got mine from Modern Performance, it was $170 and I got some stickers too!
   * Don't forget to download the software from N2MB! A quality USB &gt; Male Serial cable may be a good idea also, the provided cable is kinda trash.
* 1x 5/16" grommet and a 5/16" drill bit to drill a hole in the firewall.
* GOOD wire strippers. I got a set of the automatic strippers and they are money. I would have been pulling my hair out had I used a cheap set of wire strippers.
* Soldering iron and plenty of solder.
* Zip ties, electrical tape, razor blades, anything that makes wire management easier to clean up.
* A 10mm and 8mm socket/wrench.
* A multimeter just to verify via back probing connectors and all that jazz.

**Overview of steps:**

* Punch a hole in the firewall and feed the harness through.
* Find and splice the clutch pedal sensor (CPP), accelerator pedal sensor (APP), and cylinder 1 ignition feed at ECU (IG1).
* Strip wiring harness and find junction for coil shared power.
* Cut and splice in the ignition wires.
* Mount the WOT Box and ground the harness
* Program the WOT Box.

**Step 1: Stuffing holes.**  If you pull out the glove box, you'll see a flap of insulation that looks like it would be perfect to go around a wiring harness. I believe it's used on RHD cars, but on LHD cars it's vacant, and it goes to an easily accessible area in the engine bay behind the passenger shock tower. Pop a hole there with your 5/16" bit and put the grommet in. Feed the wires through (not the black ground wire) and route them over to the ECU area. I hid mine behind the insulation on the firewall, and then between the battery box and ECU. You should have Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Blue.

**Step 2: Warm up the soldering iron.** Disconnect the battery (8mm wrench) and pull off the ECU cover (if it still exists). You'll need to tap the following wires. Reference [THIS DIAGRAM](https://i.imgur.com/coFzMoY.png) to get the right pins. Of course you can always use that fine multimeter to verify continuity, but nevertheless, the schematic is:

* WOT Box Yellow: IG1 &gt; 2G (Purple/Grey spots)
* WOT Box Green: CPP &gt; 1BD (White/Green)
* WOT Box Blue: APP &gt; 1AP (Orange)

Find the wires, strip them back a bit (those automatic strippers really shine in this area) and solder on the WOT Box wire. I recommend against cutting the wire in half, as that may add more resistance to the circuit, in addition to being completely unneeded. Once those are connected and it passes continuity, tape them up and start the unnerving part.

**Step 3: Weight reduction.** Look at those ignition coils. The 3rd wire (right side) should be a light green with grey spots. Keep that in mind as you unwrap/cut the loom apart. Take extreme caution not to inadvertently slice any wires! I found that removing my intake, throttle body, VTCS/VICS vacuum lines, and disconnecting the Fuel Injector junction connector made it easier to get to where I needed. Follow the #3 and #4 light green/grey spot wires to a wad of electrical/kapton tape. You can either unwrap it or slice through it. I unwrapped it since I wanted to reuse the tape. At the heart of it you'll see 7 wires.

**Step 4: Sort out the ignition mess.** The 4 coil power wires are all there. The #1 and #2 coils don't enter from the top, but rather the bottom. They loop around deeper in the harness. I suggest cutting a bit farther down to find which is which and isolate them from the other wires in the cluster.

There is a large gauge green wire, a large gauge light green/grey spot wire, and another smaller gauge green wire. All 3 of these get cut. If I could do it again, I would do the following:

* Cut the 3 wires leaving a bit of tail (junction side) on all 3 to be easily reversed if need be.
* Join all 3 on the harness side and solder them to the RED WOT Box wire.
* Use one or both of the large gauge wires on the junction side to join the ORANGE WOT Box wire.
   * I did not want to fuck up the factory soldering job for all 4 coils and risk a misfire condition, so I used a length from the cut wires on the junction side to isolate my joints.
   * The above is what I am planning to do in the next few days in order to sort out some electrical weirdness I'm experiencing. I will revise with my findings if needed, however this should be just fine.

Wrap it all up, connect the battery, and go back to the passenger footwell.

**Step 5: Cable management.** Gen1s had a little door in the back of the glovebox that could just be popped out. Since Gen2s don't have that, I suggest drilling a 1/2" hole in the top/side of the glove box to sneak the wires in that way. Another hole may be necessary for the ground wire wherever you mount it, I did mine behind the kick panel near the door jamb, there is a 10mm bolt already there, and once you fit the ring terminal, that's all there is to it. Put the glovebox back in and connect the WOT Box. Verify you still have a running vehicle. If the car doesn't start, you've got problems. Make sure the WOT Box is fully connected, the ground is connected, and the red/orange wires are fully connected. You shouldn't have any issues. Turn the car off, then key on/engine off. The LED on the WOT Box will be Retina Blinding Blue^(tm). If it's not, check the Ground connection.

**Step 6: Intro to programming.** Once you get the USB&gt;Serial adapter connected, launch the WOT Box software and hit the "READ" button. This should prompt for a firmware update, then you should be able to program it from there. Make the following changes:

1. Global Settings
   1. RPM Source: Ignition Signal
   2. Check "Clutch Inverted"
2. Rev Limiter
   1. Enabled: Check
   2. RPM: 2800
   3. WRITE
3. Now verify your inputs. Without touching the pedals and refreshing the data by pressing READ, the Clutch should say UP and the TPS (Throttle position sensor, we are using the APP) should say UP.
4. Press the clutch to the floor and hit READ, it should now say DN. Release the clutch.
5. Press the gas to the floor and hit READ, It should say DN, and the clutch should go back to UP.
6. Now we need throttle voltage. This one is a bit tricky. What I did is I loaded up Torque Pro and pressed the gas down to about 70% throttle (or wherever you want the WOT Box to be active). I then hit READ and noted the voltage listed in the WOT Box program. You'll need this later, so make a note.
7. Start the car, let the RPMs settle, and READ. The RPM listed in the software should match the Tach.
8. Bring the car up to your 2800 RPM value and verify the rev limit is active. My needle is a bit higher than the number I set on the WOT Box, but I'm pretty sure that's true for all installs, and the numbers will need to be adjusted accordingly. Set your rev limit to what you want (or disable it) and hit WRITE.
9. No Lift Shift
   1. Enabled: Check
   2. Auto: Uncheck
   3. Time(ms): Start at 150 and go from there. You want power to be interrupted in the shortest amount of time possible, so start at 150 and see how it feels. You can always modify it later.
   4. TPS Threshold: That number you noted earlier in substep 6. Mine is around 2.5v, but every car is different!
   5. WRITE.
10. Go out for a test drive and try your new flat foot shift feature! Tweak it accordingly to fit your driving style/personal needs.
11. If you want to set up 2 stage/launch control, hovering over the items in the software generally does a good job of explaining what they do. I have mine set at 2800rpm with the same 2.5-ish volt TPS reading as the FFS and it works well.

THAT'S IT! Great job, very proud of you. If nothing else, I just wanted to share this information with everyone that may be looking into this and being completely lost with 0 instructions from anywhere. If this helps even 1 person, my mission here will be accomplished. As always, let me know if anything can be clarified more. I don't add photos to my guides as too many forum posts rely on photos that are now broken, and the information is useless. Not to mention macro shots of my shit soldering are not something I want on the internets.

To the radstag that helped me make a first impression of FO76 "something else" (sort of a satire, but it happened) I'm hanging out with one of my girl friends and I ask her if she wants to see the game (because I has previously shown her Fallout 3). She's like "let's see it".

I logged in and I'm showing her my C.A.M.P. "This is my bed" "This is a cooking station" "The water is poluted so I have to boil it" (She's not a gamer, just my BFF).

I proceed to the garage where all the workbenches are and I find a heckin radstag inside. O-KAY-- I'm like "Well, there's animals but he shouldn't be here honestly, but outside".. I shoot him while I explain I can eat the meat, and then he proceeds to fall THROUGH the wall of the garage, falling outside the house. I go around and it's GONE. What the heck. Anyway, I show her a bit around Flatwoods and then I decide to log out at the C.A.M.P. so I go back. There's a pile of guts with flies inside the garage where I had first killed the radstag.

Wot in tarnation! My friend liked seeing the game anyway. Wish I had captured it for r/GamePhysics

Also don't bother with the crank position sensor. It has a different method of being actuated in the ECU compared to the Gen1s/Speeds. Therefore, you will have no RPM via the CKP. Don't bother, and use the #1 ignition coil signal instead. We can program that on the WOT Box later.

**Tools required:**

* 1x N2MB WOT Box kit (duh). I got mine from Modern Performance, it was $170 and I got some stickers too!
   * Don't forget to download the software from N2MB! A quality USB &gt; Male Serial cable may be a good idea also, the provided cable is kinda trash.
* 1x 5/16" grommet and a 5/16" drill bit to drill a hole in the firewall.
* GOOD wire strippers. I got a set of the automatic strippers and they are money. I would have been pulling my hair out had I used a cheap set of wire strippers.
* Soldering iron and plenty of solder.
* Zip ties, electrical tape, razor blades, anything that makes wire management easier to clean up.
* A 10mm and 8mm socket/wrench.
* A multimeter just to verify via back probing connectors and all that jazz.

**Overview of steps:**

* Punch a hole in the firewall and feed the harness through.
* Find and splice the clutch pedal sensor (CPP), accelerator pedal sensor (APP), and cylinder 1 ignition feed at ECU (IG1).
* Strip wiring harness and find junction for coil shared power.
* Cut and splice in the ignition wires.
* Mount the WOT Box and ground the harness
* Program the WOT Box.

**Step 1: Stuffing holes.** If you pull out the glove box, you'll see a flap of insulation that looks like it would be perfect to go around a wiring harness. I believe it's used on RHD cars, but on LHD cars it's vacant, and it goes to an easily accessible area in the engine bay behind the passenger shock tower. Pop a hole there with your 5/16" bit and put the grommet in. Feed the wires through (not the black ground wire) and route them over to the ECU area. I hid mine behind the insulation on the firewall, and then between the battery box and ECU. You should have Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Blue.

**Step 2: Warm up the soldering iron.** Disconnect the battery (8mm wrench) and pull off the ECU cover (if it still exists). You'll need to tap the following wires. Reference [THIS DIAGRAM](https://i.imgur.com/coFzMoY.png) to get the right pins. Of course you can always use that fine multimeter to verify continuity, but nevertheless, the schematic is:

* WOT Box Yellow: IG1 &gt; 2G (Purple/Grey spots)
* WOT Box Green: CPP &gt; 1BD (White/Green)
* WOT Box Blue: APP &gt; 1AP (Orange)

Find the wires, strip them back a bit (those automatic strippers really shine in this area) and solder on the WOT Box wire. I recommend against cutting the wire in half, as that may add more resistance to the circuit, in addition to being completely unneeded. Once those are connected and it passes continuity, tape them up and start the unnerving part.

**Step 3: Weight reduction.** Look at those ignition coils. The 3rd wire (right side) should be a light green with grey spots. Keep that in mind as you unwrap/cut the loom apart. Take extreme caution not to inadvertently slice any wires! I found that removing my intake, throttle body, VTCS/VICS vacuum lines, and disconnecting the Fuel Injector junction connector made it easier to get to where I needed. Follow the #3 and #4 light green/grey spot wires to a wad of electrical/kapton tape. You can either unwrap it or slice through it. I unwrapped it since I wanted to reuse the tape. At the heart of it you'll see 7 wires.

**Step 4: Sort out the ignition mess.** The 4 coil power wires are all there. The #1 and #2 coils don't enter from the top, but rather the bottom. They loop around deeper in the harness. I suggest cutting a bit farther down to find which is which and isolate them from the other wires in the cluster.

There is a large gauge green wire, a large gauge light green/grey spot wire, and another smaller gauge green wire. All 3 of these get cut. If I could do it again, I would do the following:

* Cut the 3 wires leaving a bit of tail (junction side) on all 3 to be easily reversed if need be.
* Join all 3 on the harness side and solder them to the RED WOT Box wire.
* Use one or both of the large gauge wires on the junction side to join the ORANGE WOT Box wire.
   * I did not want to fuck up the factory soldering job for all 4 coils and risk a misfire condition, so I used a length from the cut wires on the junction side to isolate my joints.
   * The above is what I am planning to do in the next few days in order to sort out some electrical weirdness I'm experiencing. I will revise with my findings if needed, however this should be just fine.

Wrap it all up, connect the battery, and go back to the passenger footwell.

**Step 5: Cable management.** Gen1s had a little door in the back of the glovebox that could just be popped out. Since Gen2s don't have that, I suggest drilling a 1/2" hole in the top/side of the glove box to sneak the wires in that way. Another hole may be necessary for the ground wire wherever you mount it, I did mine behind the kick panel near the door jamb, there is a 10mm bolt already there, and once you fit the ring terminal, that's all there is to it. Put the glovebox back in and connect the WOT Box. Verify you still have a running vehicle. If the car doesn't start, you've got problems. Make sure the WOT Box is fully connected, the ground is connected, and the red/orange wires are fully connected. You shouldn't have any issues. Turn the car off, then key on/engine off. The LED on the WOT Box will be Retina Blinding Bluetm. If it's not, check the Ground connection.

**Step 6: Intro to programming.** Once you get the USB&gt;Serial adapter connected, launch the WOT Box software and hit the "READ" button. This should prompt for a firmware update, then you should be able to program it from there. Make the following changes:

1. Global Settings
   1. RPM Source: Ignition Signal
   2. Check "Clutch Inverted"
2. Rev Limiter
   1. Enabled: Check
   2. RPM: 2800
   3. WRITE
3. Now verify your inputs. Without touching the pedals and refreshing the data by pressing READ, the Clutch should say UP and the TPS (Throttle position sensor, we are using the APP) should say UP.
4. Press the clutch to the floor and hit READ, it should now say DN. Release the clutch.
5. Press the gas to the floor and hit READ, It should say DN, and the clutch should go back to UP.
6. Now we need throttle voltage. This one is a bit tricky. What I did is I loaded up Torque Pro and pressed the gas down to about 70% throttle (or wherever you want the WOT Box to be active). I then hit READ and noted the voltage listed in the WOT Box program. You'll need this later, so make a note.
7. Start the car, let the RPMs settle, and READ. The RPM listed in the software should match the Tach.
8. Bring the car up to your 2800 RPM value and verify the rev limit is active. My needle is a bit higher than the number I set on the WOT Box, but I'm pretty sure that's true for all installs, and the numbers will need to be adjusted accordingly. Set your rev limit to what you want (or disable it) and hit WRITE.
9. No Lift Shift
   1. Enabled: Check
   2. Auto: Uncheck
   3. Time(ms): Start at 150 and go from there. You want power to be interrupted in the shortest amount of time possible, so start at 150 and see how it feels. You can always modify it later.
   4. TPS Threshold: That number you noted earlier in substep 6. Mine is around 2.5v, but every car is different!
   5. WRITE.
10. Go out for a test drive and try your new flat foot shift feature! Tweak it accordingly to fit your driving style/personal needs.
11. If you want to set up 2 stage/launch control, hovering over the items in the software generally does a good job of explaining what they do. I have mine set at 2800rpm with the same 2.5-ish volt TPS reading as the FFS and it works well.

THAT'S IT! Great job, very proud of you. If nothing else, I just wanted to share this information with everyone that may be looking into this and being completely lost with 0 instructions from anywhere. If this helps even 1 person, my mission here will be accomplished. As always, let me know if anything can be clarified more. I don't add photos to my guides as too many forum posts rely on photos that are now broken, and the information is useless. Not to mention macro shots of my shit soldering are not something I want on the internets.

Tuned my car for the first time and I'm confused with octane maps Went to the main revo dealer in my country, 30% power and torque increase, it's insane the difference.

Anyhow, when I got there I had 85% of tank filled with 95 octane, The guy flashing the tune said I have 3 options: 95 octane map, 98ish (his words) and 100.

He said the second one would be my best bet since the fuel here is notorious for not being the best, plus, being in the middle i can fill up with any type of gas, he strongly suggested 100 octane tho.

Question #1: does it hurt the car in any way if the fuel is actually high quality 100 octane gas and I have the 98 map (higher octane gas than tuned for)?

Moreover, I went drove the car until i had 25%ish tank left and filled up with a 100 octane gas he suggested.

Question #2: I didn't absolutely trashed the car but drove it like anyone would with such a significant power increase, is it bad that I drove that long and somewhat sporty with a lower octane has than the map has?

I asked the guys this twice and they said it can't hurt the car in any way, one of them said "just don't go WOT all the time". If it's absolutely fine to drive with the gas I currently have in the tank, why is there such restriction?

I realise I'm overthinking this but I've read a lot of contradictory answers

Thanks guys. Still can't believe what difference this stuff makes

How does batch injector firing work? (4 cyl) this is about to get way too deep, heads up.

In the context of a 4 cyl, multi port fuel injection.

I understand batch firing fires injectors in pairs because the ECU doesn't know which individual cylinder is on what stroke, it just knows one pair'd cylinder is on the intake stroke, the other is on the power stroke.

So for the cylinder on the power stroke, the intake valve is shut. When the injector fires, what happens to the fuel? Does it get sucked backwards towards the cylinder on the intake stroke?

When you're going WOT in a turbo car and there's 15+ psi of boost in the intake mani pushing against the valves, then what happens to the fuel? I can't imagine it doesn't pool on the valve. and I feel like the back side of the valve would be hot enough to cause auto ignition.

I know it works fine in practice, but I don't see logically how it isn't causing issues.

[Concept, WoT] New Syndicate weapon augments for 4 weapons + 1 Archgun each Seeing how many new weapons we got since syndicate weapon augments came out (the same can be said even if i just consider the most recent ones, that came out during the Ambulas event), it would be nice to see as many as 24 ground weapons and an 6 archwing weapons get a mod that is both fun and good performance wise.

I initially thought of archgun augments just because, but now i could see some purpose in that since they will be usable on the ground and it looks like they'll have a purpose in Orb Heists...

[WP] One Christmas you stay up and hide to see Santa, but what comes down the chimney is a large, green, toothy being “Oi youz grots! Get down ere wit da zoggin prezents! An let me haz da snackz dis time!” Yup, Santa is an orc Warboss. Writing Prompt Prompt from  /u/toothygoblin

&amp;#x200B;

I looked out from under the fur I’d used as a makeshift hide, and bed, as I dozed through the night to catch a glimpse of Saint Nicholas and stifled a gasp.

On the hulking green strangers leather jerkin I could see the words “Santa’z Boyz” picked out in rough iron studs.

“Where’s me list?” shouted the Orc, pacing the room.

As he walked past me a wave of miasma hit. He smelled about as attractive as he looked, unfortunately. Rotten meat, sweat and anger mixed into a foul broth. I tried to remain still, but couldn’t hold the catch in my throat.

At once the Orc whirled on my hiding place. I pulled the fur over me, trying to will myself into sleep, to escape this bad dream.

“WHO ‘AVE WE ‘ERE THEN?”, roared Santa, pulling the cover from me. My mouth was a dry as the deserts of Araby, and I could offer nothing in return. The Orc took hold of my shirt and lifted me to his eye level.

“Scrawny little fing intcha? Where are we anyway?” he asked a Goblin to his left.

“Kislev, Boss”, his underling replied.

The Goblin got a swift kick in the side for his trouble.

“Where the bleedin ‘ell is Kislev, you useless maggot! Is this an Ooman or a halfling or what?”

“Kislev is where the Oomans wiv the furry hats live, Boss” replied the Goblin nursing his obviously broken ribs.

“Ah I fought it woz a bit cold. Why you not answer me, fleshscrap? I asked you in Ooman.”

“I, I….” I returned bravely.

“Eye eye is for Warbosses on the floating Hulks, Fleshscrap. You fink you are on tha boat! AH HAHAHAHAHA”. He laughed uproariously at his own humour, and quickly (although not quickly enough to save one from another kick) the Goblins joined in with the general hilarity.

I found my voice finally, and screamed for my mother. This only made the greenskins laugh more.

“YOUR MUVVA! Wot you fink she’s gonna do! She can’t even hear us!”

I screamed again, but no-one stirred in the bedchamber behind me.

“She. Can’t. Hear. Us.” repeated the Orc, swinging me from side to side with each word for effect. “Somefing to do with wot them pointy eared bleedin wimps dun. No-one can hear us”.

My heart sank. There was nothing I could do to save myself. The tears started to come.

“URGH! Its leakin!” bellowed the Orc and dropped me back onto my fur.

“Wot we gunna do, Santa?” asked one of the Goblins.

“Depends wot list she’s on. If its a norty wun, we can just kill ‘er. Get me list already!”

The Goblins scurried back into the fireplace, and disappeared. Santa continued to pace. He crossed his huge cucumber like fingers.

“Never ‘appened to Santa. Never, ever. The Elves will never let me forget it.”

The Goblins reappeared, carrying a huge book. Like Santa’s jacket it was studded with iron. It said simply, ‘DA LIST’.

The Orc opened it. “Wot. Is. Yor. Name?”

“K.k.k. Kruld” I stammered out.

The Orc stopped and looked at me then. “Like Vaslo Kruld? That why you never called for yor Da? He is a proper loon”.

He shrugged and continued to leaf through his book. “You MUST be naughty then”, he said to himself.

Santa visibly deflated as he finally found his place in the tome.

“Nice. She’s zoggin nice.” he brightened for a second. “I’ll just check it again tho’. Useless blinkin Gobbos dun the list wrong everytime!”

He shut the book with a snap and cloud of dust.

“Nope. Nice. Vaslo’s girl is a good kid. I can’t puzzle it out, and can’t kill 'er.”

Santa picked me up again. I gave a short squeak.

“Looks like you are coming wiv us. You got to meet the Elves.”

Kimchisoup's journey into hell and then double hell :O Oof!  It's been a while my fellow Norrathians, hope everyone is well!  I think I left off on day 19 or something like that.  I believe I was level 52 as well and headed to CS to quad some more of those wyverns!  I killed enough Frost Giants in Eastern Wastes to get dubious with the dragons so quadding the Wyverns was super easy compared to trying it without faction.  If you plan on quadding them, I highly recommend working on your faction first!  It'll save you lots of unwanted hassle.  Also, I don't remember what day it is as far as my road to 60 goes so, I think I'm about day 24 or 25.  Either way, I won't get 60 in 30 days like I planned so, RIP!  Shoutout to Jakkaris, Lelouche and Esham who hooked it up with a cloak in CS while we were quadding Wyverns together.  We were the only 2 in the zone, it was lovely.  Shout out to Kneepuncher and Andus who sold me a POTG for when I ding 60!

When the Wyverns got too crowded, I headed over to check the Tar Goo's out in Wakening Land and met up with a Gnome warrior named Mechanos.  Shout out to him for the good times and endless killing.  A HUGE shout out to Tifah, my biggest fan!  ;)  These past few days I've kinda been grouping on and off and taking a break from quadding.  I've missed the interaction with people and quadding got a little lonely so, I've been duo/trio with people doing Tar Goo's and Geo's in Wakening Lands.  Pretty solid loot and steady xp for sure.

The next day I logged on and got a tell from Tofat and he asked if I wanted to pull in the basement of Karnor's.  I only remembered trains from live in KC, so I told him I had no balls and was scared to pull.  He insisted I come, showed me the ropes and I ended up pulling in the basement for about 12 hours.  I have now become a man!  After you learn the layout and work harmony, it goes very smoothly.  Pretty good xp and the loot wasn't bad either.  Shout out to Tofat, Antikythera, Icrit, Grizzlore, Demoni, Ferragut, Synful, Puppo, Ziggenn, Quit, Tunesz, Tapered, Kaskadia, Brolik and Celinedra.  Along with quadding wyverns, some more frost Giants and grouping in KC I dinged 54!  Welcome to double hell :)

I took a power nap, logged back on and got invited to another KC group.  Shout out to Misster, my boy Runuk again, Medicinebear, Shortslice, Vraptin, Emerakul, Junta, Happyheals and Shumpurt for the solid xp's!  After grouping for a bit, I decided to try quadding the Tar Goo's and the Suits in Wakening Lands.  Boy, oh boy, was the xp awesome.  Qxzv showed me the way to the 4 suits and gave me the run down on how to do it. So, I started off the with the 4 suit pull and with my mana pool, It's just not efficient enough for me.  (Should have bought a lumi) :P  But, the Goo's are perfect and drop great loot.  With POTG I'm able to pull 1 out of the 5 room and drag the 3 out of the 3 room and start my quad.  2 quads back to back with little downtime.  I think I make anywhere from a 1 1/2 blues-2 blues in an hour quadding these plus about 500 pp.  So, seems pretty good to me.  I may make a short video on my quad method's I've learned from guides and the amazing people who've helped me along the way.  Maybe a lowbie druid can benefit from it.

I believe it's day 25 and I've just been steady grouping with people still killing the Geodudes and Tar Goo's in the cave next to the Druid ring in WL.  Shout out to Vynidalan, Michal, Flibidy, Shelks, Blimeys, Lelkers, Sablut and Gazlak for the fun parties and xp.  On a side note, I finally bought a pair of boots!  Madworld sold me Coldain boots and gloves!  I appreciate it man.  I wanted to give a very special shout out to Oakshille, the halfling Drood brother such as myself.  He said after reading some of my boring adventures he decided to hop back on his druid after a few years.  Glad to have you back man!

As I'm writing this, I'm headed back to the cave to kill with a group and will hopefully ding 55 tonight!  I've also been invited to join a few guilds, which I may do here when I get higher level, just not sure which I want to join.  They all seem pretty chill and I can't really make a decision haha.  A few random questions, but does anyone know what people pay/charge for power leveling?  I think I can probably do 1-30 without too many issues and want to make some plat for some gear down the road.  I'm also curious as to how much the Coldain chest MQ is for druids, any info would be great!  I may start on my epic within the next few days as well, so if anyone is super bored... I'd love the help :)

Hope you guys enjoyed the long WOT, I'll see you guys in game!

Can't get engine to run So I'm no stranger to engines and motorcycles. But this being my first Chinese 2 stroke 66cc engine kit.
I ordered the gt7 pro racing engine from gasbikes.net on Thanksgiving and it's been nothing but trouble. I figured going with a local company would be smart. But honestly they suck

First they shipped me the wrong reed valve. And a bum cdi. I called next day to get it replaced. It still hasn't shipped. So I got tired of waiting and I ordered a CDHPOWER carbon fiber reed valve from Amazon. And a bike berry high output magneto and stage 1 CDI. I also have a Klein clone 28mm carburetor

So on to the engine issue. I installed a zeda vented piston and a cnc high compression head. Now when I try to start the engine it won't idle or rev. However if I get up to 15mph and drop the clutch with WOT I can get the engine to pull me along for 30m or so but then it dies. And wont idle. I'm thinking its lost compression. But since I moved shop I dont have a compression tester anymore. But when assembling the engine originally I noticed a small nick in the cylinder gasket. Not all the way through.

I ordered new gaskets from Amazon. They will be here tomorrow morning.

If it's not the gaskets what else could it be? From the stock engine with the same issue I've replaced:
Piston zeda vented
Magneto high output
Bike berry stage 1 cdi
Carbon fiber reed valve.
Stock head
And cnc racing head

U wot m8? You think ECE is filled with degenerates? MATH 115. The one exam where I would have to face an army of non-ECE plebs. I was ready to put their stupid asses in their place.

Instead of studying like those foreskin sandwiches, I prepared my plan of attack. I went rummaging for cardboard and tinfoil throughout campus, and every once in a while an overgrown aborted fetus would tell me to stop throwing trash everywhere. I simply pulled my magic keyboard out of my ass and got them stuck in an infinite for loop, which obliterated both their minds and unsexy bodies.

Once I had gathered the materials, I carefully crafted a tinfoil hat and cardboard armor (I made sure to put abs on it because I'm so hot). For shits and giggles, I decided to spray paint the cardboard green so that I would look like my idol and waifu Pickle Rick. I practiced my atomic karate in the armor, and I knew I was ready when I split an atom and caused a small atomic explosion that gave me colon cancer. I looked like a fucking e🅱️ic cross between Mega Man and Pickle Dick, so I decided to appropriately name myself Mega Dick.

My contacts had given me the locations for all the 115 exams, and I was ready to strike. I entered my exam room and the proctors were already pestering me to take my AWESOME armor off. I was prepared, as I used my extreme ECE intelligence to finish the exam in 0.000001 seconds flat, as did all the other ECE. I shoved the paper into the proctors mouth and marched off to do my thing.

I traveled around campus expertly tracking down the non-ECE that plagued MATH 115. I reeeeeed, naruto ran faster than sanic the hedgehog, rick rolled everyone, and secretly spread my colon cancer all while I had a RAGING BONER. I had a lustful desire to wreck all the baboon dicks that were known as non-ECE.

Somewhere along the way I ran so fucking fast I accidentally set some guy's nips on fire, and shit escalated from there. Soon, the majority of campus was in flames. Every shit eating simpleton non-ECE had their head shoved up their ass (by me obviously), and I knew my mission had been accomplished. I stood proudly on top of DP with my glorious armor. With one powerful fart, I blasted into the sky looking for my next target, which I decided would be U of T.

p.s. I had to go to the ER because I realized my ass was on fire, but Mega Dick will be back for YOU

Craftsman snowblower chugs and dies under load. I have a Craftsman Snowblower model  247.88355 that I inherited with my house a couple of years ago.  It's done fairly well, but in the past year, it has gotten increasingly bad at actually throwing snow, and in the heavier storms it sometimes stalls out completely.  With the cover off, I can see the governor goes WOT momentarily when I engage the auger, but I can't run it in snow that way.  I have tried cleaning out and then replacing the carburetor (with a cheap chinese knock off) to no effect.  I've read a couple reports that the exhaust valve can degrade such that the motor loses power, but that also seems to pair with flames coming out of the exhaust when running, which I am not seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping you guys have thoughts on what else I can troubleshoot, because I'm ready to throw the thing out a window.

How much blowby is too much in PCV Catch Can? I have a 2017 WRX MT with 22K miles. I'm running MAPerformance's 93 Stage 1+ tune with their intake as my only engine mod (installed about 1K miles ago).

&amp;#x200B;

I installed a PCV side Mishimoto Catch Can at 21K miles and I got about 2oz of blowby oil within the past 1000 miles. Is this excessive for the FA20DIT engines? How much oil does your catch can usually catch?


Additional info: I daily drive it, usually staying around 20% throttle with one or two WOT pulls after the oil is up to temp. It's beginning of winter where I live, so the outside temp is around 30 degrees F most days since I've installed the catch can.

New edge bama tuning issues Back at it again with new edge issues. So my 2000 4.6 2v came with a bama performance tuner with a preloaded 4.6 tune. After fixing my misfire by replacing all my injectors with 24lb injectors i re tuned it for the injectors and it has some issues. With and without the tune i have power loss at wot. And with the tune my idle (in motion only) runs between 1500 and 2000 rpm. Also throws a p0602 code with the tune. Dont know if im doing something wrong or the tuner/tune went bad somehow. I know i cant go wot with these injectors on the stock tune without massive misfiring due to running rich af so im not sure what to do. Bama/american muscle wont answer my emails and i think thats because i didnt buy directly from them. Budget doesnt allow for a new tune or anything like that. For all i know it could just be my car causing this but im so lost. Bank 1 and 2 throwing "system too rich" codes. Any help appreciated. Thanks

Second terrible experince (RANT) I have no where else to rant about this terrible expirience so i decided to post on here while hearing views from other SD/SB comment on who is wrong in this situation.

After knowing wot on SA (i really put him as that because i wasnt sure where we were going) we decided to take this chat on whatsapp. Initially it was going ok. I made it really clear that i dont want anything intimate on the first m&amp;g. He then said "then i will not give you allowance too" kinda rude but i didnt ask for it too, but i said "ok i wasnt planning to"

So suddenly he just ghosted me and out of the blue. But he text me again asking if i wanna meet. He even said if we click well we shall go to the hotel immidiately. i rejected saying i do not do intimate things on the first m&amp;g, he agreed that he wont do it and we decided to meet 2 days later. For two days, the chat was going ok. He kept complimenting me and all. On the day we met we ordered food and i didnt take my wallet with me so i wasnt able to pay for my food at the counter and once we sat down we started chatting and it slipped my mind to pay for my food. (Tbh it wasnt really costly because it was near my office and the food is more affordable than other places). When we were done with our dinner he said "is there any place near here?" I was confused. Then he said "never mind we can just find a handicap toilet too" i finally got what he said and i shook my head saying "no." At this pount of time i was kinda upset as i already stated clear initially that i dont do initmate things on the first &amp;g, but he decided to try his luck i guess. Then he asked "no as is no for now or no for never ever?" I looked him straight in the eye and said "never ever" he then suddenly whipped out his phone and showed me a screen shot of some girl's instagram story and said "this is my SB, pretty right? Shes at overseas now." I smiled and agreed "yes shes very pretty, is she coming back anytime soon?" I genuinely thought he is ok with this, really. He then replied "ya she's coming back" and ended with "nice knowing you" and just left. So i thought maybe he was rushing back to his wife or something.

But then he text me saying im a dissapointment and im a freeloader. At first i was pissed but then i felt really rude with my initial reply so i sent anothet text. And again, he insulted me. You guys tell me if its my fault.

Spider Beanie. Title: Spider Beanie

Author: GreyGoff

Genre: Horror/Mystery

Words: 680

Chapter 1:

Ere! Davo? Did you see that blokes beanie move? I swear it moved! Yer still bleary from last night ya mug...Nah, nah! Take another gander! The chap across the street looked at them dully after the rather loud incredulous exchange and blinked. As the two lads met his gaze, eight legs emerged from the sides of the man's beanie.

Four pairs of red searing eyes came into eye contact. Stunned into disbelief, two sets of jaws dropped at the sight of the creature raising itself off it's hosts head. Nigel's hand instinctively reached for Dave's as the fight or flight instinct started to kick in. Yer Wot! Dave was frozen like a snake captivated by a mongoose but not the ever paranoid Nigel.

Just in time Nigel yanked at Dave as the enormous spider sprang into the air in their direction. The two lads had a good head-start right up until they ducked into the nearest alleyway hoping to get back into the bright daylight of the High street. The web was strung between the narrow walls of the lane and caught them all too easily despite the speed at which they slammed into it. It gave at first a bit like a trampoline before pulling them back hard against a rather foul smelling dumpster. We're fucked! Dave panted hard and cursed between breaths.

 We're fucked we're fucked we're fucked catching the words in his mouth as he looked up to see the beanie sized spider crawl over the top of Nigel's head. It settled into place despite the frantic screams leaving Nigel's lips, then sank two ebony black fangs the size of Satay skewers into his agonised friends scalp. The blood curdling cry soon replaced with little more than a blank stare and a thread of drool escaping Nigel's lips.

Dave knew he was next. The stench escaping from the dumpster was more than obvious by now, there were other victims littered about the place too. How does this shit happen in the back streets of a city? Dave's mind raced searching for a solution to his more than inevitable problem. The coppers steer clear because of the junkies and the homeless, hookers occasionally blew a John here and there out of plain sight. Fuck me! I'm fucked!

Red blazing eyes locked onto the man before him obviously desperate to escape but going nowhere. Nigel's eyes had gone dead and ghostly white like one of those TV zombies. Oh! Fuck me! Dave's mind still screaming for a way out. That's when he realised that he wasn't actually stuck, his clothes were but he wasn't trapped the same way Nigel had been. Dave stared at the creature sucking the life out of his friend intently as he drew his hands back into his sleeves. With a bit of twisting and turning he managed to withdraw his arms, pausing for a moment to loosen his belt while his hands were still concealed beneath the jacket.

If his Mum knew that wearing his pants down as low as he did would save his life one day she would never have given him so much grief about how it looked. Dave stood on his toes as the waistband of his jeans dropped to his knees, carefully he wriggled his trainers off while still maintaining eye contact after what had seemed like an eternity. All he had to do now was duck out of his jacket and dive out of the clothes that were firmly attached to the web, easy!

Dave could see that Nigel's knees were starting to buckle under his weight, he was running out of time. The spider was almost done with him, it's eyes dulling momentarily as it finished this meal off. Dave took that as his queue and dove clean out of his clothes tearing a path back the way he had come and out into Daylight. He didn't stop for anyone or anything a pale white streak in sock clad feet racing for dear life towards the nearest Police Station. They didn't believe him of course. Would you?

Banned for an hour So I came back from work and wanted to play some WoT. Honestly, I started a game and a guy rammed me... he got 0 damage to himself but inflicted like 10 to me... I didn't really mind so I just rode straight away... he shot me... which kind of triggered me and I shot him back... then he missed, then I shot him once more which was a bad idea because I turned blue. I was mad because he started the fight and I was the blue guy I mean ... so I shot him one more time -&gt; ban -&gt; have a good day :D I know I am an idiot sorry to bother.

Tuning for backfire! Hello all, I own a pretty modified 95 Mustang GT with a Anderson PMS tuner. I'm fairly new to tuning, and it seems like a fairly rudimentary system, but I was hoping to achieve a backfire at a certain RPM and throttle position. When I first got the car, it had a bad injector and some other problems with ignition, so while it didn't run 100%, it gave a great crackle and backfire at the rev limiter which I fell in love with. Its been given a full tune up and no longer backfires.

Basically what I want to do is this: At wide open throttle and at the rev limit of 6500~, I want the car to crackle and backfire. I have tried increasing and reducing fuel by as much as 25% at WOT to try and get an incomplete burn so that it detonates in the exhaust. I have also tried playing with the timing, +10 or -10 degrees at WOT/6500 rpm.

With reduced fuel and -10 timing it seems to give a little backfire on occasion, but nothing compared to what it used to do.

I don't know much about tuning, so I guess what I need to know is what track I should be on. More fuel or less, + timing or -, and considerations for safety of the engine while trying to achieve this goal.

WOT misfire So a few months ago I would get this really bad miss at WOT. Powerloss, shuddering, white smoke, flashing check engine light, the usual. I thought it was an injector, but decided to check the plugs. They were pretty worn down and over gapped so I got some new ones and put them in. BOOM! The SHO was back.
However today I am experiencing similar symptom at WOT just not as bad. I'm assuming that the plugs are wearing fast. I'm wondering what could be the cause of this? Could it be an injector? It definitely seems like air/fuel ratio is off at WOT, but I'm over thinking it.
It's a 2010 airraid Cai, Corsa cat back, lower thermo, unleashed tune with 3 bar. I've been running the tune for a few years so I'm pretty positive that unless it decided to fork everything overnight that's not it

ELI5: How long can you run a car engine at WOT for? For argument sake, say that the engine RPM stays just below the redline and the cooling system is able to keep up. Can you run a car engine continuously at WOT for extended periods of time(ie. several hours) without blowing something up?

On a side note, I've also wondered about those high performance turbocharged motors (ones that glow the manifold cherry red).

I'm aware that running an engine at higher RPMs will wear it out faster but I'm curious how a typical(or even high performance) engine will fare when run at peak power for extended times.

Rode "The Deathcycle" 26 miles today So as some of you know I just finished my first build of a motorized bike. It took all of my skills to get it mounted in a bike frame that was too small. Fabricating custom mounts. Rebending exhaust. Had to cut 2 fins off the head just to get the engine to fit.

But I took it for its first long ride today. 13 miles to work and 13 miles home. And a few questions and concerns come to mind.

I weigh 240lbs and I'm 6'1". I'm using a schwinn ascension-29 29er mtb with a 30t rear sprocket mounted directly to the disk brake hub.

I have in my engine a kleihn carb and a high compression head. I also have a zeda vented piston and a reed valve. Stock cylinder and stock exhaust. (A new ported and machined cylinder come Thursday)

The bike wont go over 25mph. And struggles with hills. If I pedal along with it I can get up to 30mph on flat ground. The engine seems to be running at about 30% max rpm (guessed by exhaust noise) at top speed with WOT.

Now I know some of these issues are because I weigh so much (I'm ex military so I have a lot of muscle) but could it also be another issue?

I knew I would have trouble with low speeds with this sprocket and wheel setup anything under 15mph stalls the engine. But it feels down on power to me. But could this just be because I'm a fatass and the engine simply isnt strong enough for my weight?

1998 GC8 Subaru: Exhaust Volume Varies &amp; Loss of Power  hi everyone!

i have a hks hi-power catback exhaust on my  car, but sometimes i notice that the car runs quieter than usual. do you think this might be because the cat is plugged up? i've also noticed that the car suddenly loses power in the high-end (outside of the normal power curve, you can feel a slight jolt on WOT sometimes and suddenly you begin accelerating slower, i've ruled out the fuel pump being the issue here because of the inconsistency of it actually happening)

any ideas?

Is there a word or phrase for the way football thugs try to start fights ? Explanation below. ## Question for UK / European guys

📷

You know how football fans are known for getting into fights ?

Well one thing that I've always wondered about, is why, when looking for a fight, your "common or garden" football thug, will walk around bare chested, right up to someone, and hold both their arms outstretched, sticking their chest out, like some sort of deformed peacock.

What's the actual "fighting mentality" behind this, exactly, I mean is it some sort of fight strategy that I have missed or is it just the usual football thuggery nonsense. I'm guessing that while I look at one of his hands, he nuts me or something.

I had a guy threaten me like this, in a petrol station in the summer, because I politely "beeped" at him when he stopped in the middle of the road, blocking it, to talk with someone.

I stress the word politely, I barely even touched the horn, it was more of a "meep" than a "beep", to politely say "Can you please move along, you appear to be blocking the road"

Anyway, so he gets out of his car at the petrol station which I was going to and he walks up to me like this - arms outstretched and pushes his bare chest into me - and asks me in that endearing way "Wot is youuaaaa fuckkiiiiiiiiinnnnnnngggggg problem, yeah ?"

I'm a rugby player, I've been in my fair share of "heavyweight" fights, he was a skinny little pale football runt.  I laughed at him , and said "You do realise that there is CCTV, which has recorded your number plate, and seen you walk right up to me just now ?" So that appeared to shut him up.

Anyway, back to the question. What is that about. Just "peacocking" ?

My Worst Moment in Truck Simulator so Far I just finished a delivery of Christmas Chocolate to Kalmar from Kapellskar. Or so I thought.


It wasn't a particularly long trip, but it was the last of several I had made today and I was getting a bit tired and had been eager to wrap things up since about halfway through. Because it was an external contract I didn't want to stop for the night and end up making the delivery late tomorrow, so I soldiered on. Finally I arrived in Kalmar, glad to be finished. As I pulled into the parking lot I decided to skip parking, hitting the button to do as soon as I was in range. At that moment my internet crapped out on me, and my sync with WoT began to hang for minutes on end, so I cancelled the sync hoping
 try again. By this time my controller was already back on my desk and had forgotten that the truck had been moving. All of the sudden, to my horror, I was moving at high speed towards a bunch of crates at the end of the lot, which I crashed into. It was at this point that I noticed the message in my GPS display: "External contract cancelled"


All of that for nothing.

Anyone with a supercharged 3800 car... Bad KR issue... 1996 Buick Riviera (L67) I have a 1996 Buick Riviera (Series II L67) and am getting terrible kr...

The car has a 3.6 pulley, zzp downpipe, 180* tstat, and colder plugs.

I'm thinking the car has a vacuum leak (High LTFTs at idle, as well as a 50rpm fluctuation), but for the life of me cannot find it.  Additionally, I'm pretty sure the EGR valve is shot.  (Aeroforce gauge I have shows the code, although check engine light is not on)

Now for the KR issue...

Anything from about 25%-75% throttle results in 4-8* KR

When at WOT, it spikes high about 7* and then quickly trails down to 0-3*

I'm guessing part of the issue is with the potential vacuum leak/bad EGR valve, but I wouldn't have imagined it to cause so much KR especially on a relatively large pulley still.

Any thoughts???  Or maybe anything else I can monitor on my Aeroforce scan gauge to help figure this out?

Had my first wreck. Extremely eye-opening and disappointing :/ So this happened a few nights ago, driving home in the rain. There’s a spot where I live that goes from 40 to 50 and every night I drive home I downshift to 2/3 and get on it just for the smiles. This time was different in that the second I got to WOT the car snapped pretty quickly sideways to the left and at this point I panicked and got off the gas and on the brakes but this ended up being the final straw. The car went from sideways with the front pointed left to being completely backwards with the ass end headed down the road and tilted toward the left side curb. Managed to avoid the curb and hit some grass but was still a violent experience. A popped tire, 3 tires needing reseating, a cracked wheel, an alignment, a trans leak, $1400, and 7ish days of waiting. 100% my fault and I gotta reap the punishment! Oh well, gotta learn your limits. Stupid that I learned them on public roads I know. Thankfully no one was around, this was late at night and nothing other than my car and my pride was hurt.

Friends, tonight I may have reached the pinnacle of being a Subaru enthusiast.... And I'll explain to you why. TL;DR I purchased another Subaru tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

For the long story, I've been into Subarus for well over 10 years. I've owned 11, across many models and trim levels, but I only regret ever giving up 1. I know that I like to complain a lot about my cars, as any enthusiast will, but it really does come from a place of love. Despite what my flair would lead you to believe, it really is a love for my cars. This car I gave up was really a unicorn. She only ever left me stranded once in the 40k or so miles I owned her. That was from 228k to 266ish. And that was an easy $50 fix. No matter what I put her through, she pushed through and got me where I needed to be. She hauled my dogs without complaints, I pushed her WOT constantly because traffic was bad and there were no groans, hiccups or head gasket failures. The gas mileage wasn't bad either. She had enough utility to haul an arbor to my friend's wedding, and could ford the flood waters of downtown Tampa when it would rain hard. I made it home. Every. Time.

&amp;#x200B;

She's not the most beautiful. She's not the fastest. Hell, she's not even the most desirable car that I've owned. But she is reliable, she is "faithful," and she has always been there to get me home. This car, \*this\* is the reason I'm a Subaru enthusiast. I purchased this car about 4 years ago for a daily and drove the ever living piss out of it. I sold it to my friend when I left Florida in 2016, and actually had reservations about giving her up. It's the \*only\* car I've every regretted giving up. And tonight, I was able to buy her back. A little worse for wear than when I handed her off, but she's back home now. I couldn't be more excited to have this car back. From the musty smell of a 19 year old car with slightly leaky frameless windows, to the weird brake springy sound it sometimes makes when you're driving, she's still Wilma. Powering through the abuse the teenage girl put on her (she was run almost dry of oil) but never giving up. She has over 293k on the clock now and I look forward to rolling that odometer over some more.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I've posted it here before, but here she is back home where she belongs: \[Wilma\]([https://imgur.com/6Y7X5H7](https://imgur.com/6Y7X5H7))

Ee cleaneded owt dat icebox as qwick as a flash.
Why, dat Gnrunch eben took their last kan o' 'ash!
Den ee stuffeded awl da grub up da smoke belcher wif gley.
"An NOWS!" grinneded da Gnrunch, "meeb will stuf up da trey!"
An da Gnrunch grabbeded da trey, an ee starteded ter shove,
Wen ee 'eard a bitty sound loike da coo o' a dove.
Ee turned around fast, an ee saw a bitty Uumie!
Lil' Cindy-lou , Uumie was nub mor'un twuu.
Da Gnrunch ad bin caught by dis bitty  daughta,
Who'd got outa bed fer a cup o' cold wata.
She stared at da Gnrunch an said, "Santy Claus, why,”
"Why are ya takin' our Christmas trey? WHY?"
But, y'knowz, dat ole Gnruunch was so smart an so slikk,
Ee thoght up a lie, an ee thoght it up qwick!
"Why, mi sweet lil' tot," da fake Santy Claus lied,
"There'z a lite on dis trey dat won't lite on wun side."
"So me'm takin' it 'ome ter mi workshop, mi deer."
"me'll fix it up der. Den me'll brin' it back 'ere."
An 'is fib fooled da sprog. Den ee padded 'er 'ed,
An ee got 'er a drink an ee sent 'er ter bed.
An wen Cindylou  went ter bed wif 'er cup,
EE went ter da smoke belcher an stuffeded da trey up!
Den da last fing ee took Was da log fer their fire!
Den ee went up da smoke belcher, 'isself, da ole liar.
On their walls ee left nuffin but 'ooks an sum wire.
An da wun speck o' grub Dat ee left in da 'owse,
Wuzza crumb dat was eben too bitty fer a mouse.
Den Ee did da same fing Ter da uvver Uumies' 'ouses
Leavin' crumbs Much too bitty Fer da uvver Uumies' mousz!
It was qwarter past duwn... Awl da Uumies, still a-bed,
Awl da Uumies, still asnooze Wen ee packed up 'is sled,
Packed it up wif their per-sents! Da ribbons! Da wrappin's!
Da tags! An da tinsel! Da trimmin's! Da trappin's!
Trii thousand feet up! Up da side o' Mt. Crumpit,
Ee rode wif 'is load ter da tiptop ter dump it!
"Poohpooh ter da Uumies!" ee was Gnrunchishlee 'umming.
"Deyz findin' owt nows dat no Christmas iz comin'!"
"Deyz jus' wakin' up!  Meeb knowz jus' wot they'll du!"
"Their mouds will 'ang opun a minute or twuu,
Den da Uumies down in 'Ivecity will awl cry Boohoo!"
"Datz a noiz," grinneded da Gnrunch, "Dat meeb simplee MUST 'eer!"
So ee paused. An da Gnrunch put 'is 'and ter 'is ear.
An ee did 'eer a sound risin' ober da snow.
It starteded in low. Den it starteded ter grow.
But da sound wasn't sad! Why, dis sound soundeded merry!
It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
Ee stared down at 'Ivecity! Da Gnrunch popped 'is eyz!
Den ee shook! Wot ee saw wuzza shockin' surpriz!
Ebry Uumie down in 'Ivecity, da tall an da bitty,
Was sqwaakin! Wif'out ony per-sents at awl!
Ee ADN'T stoppeded Christmas from comin'! IT CAME!
Sumhow or uvver, it came jus' da same!
An da Gnrunch, wif 'is gnrunch-feet ice-cold in da snow,
Stud puzzlin' an puzzlin': "Ow cud it be so?"
"It came wif owt ribbons! It came wif'out tags!"
"It came wif'out packagz, boxz or bags!"
An ee puzzleded trii 'ours, till 'is puzzla was sore.
Den da Gnrunch thoght o' sumthing ee adn't before!
"Maybe Christmas," ee thoght, "doesn't cumz from a store."
"Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a lil' bit more!"
An whadappeneded  den? Well...in 'Ivecity they say,
Dat da Gnrunch'z bitty 'eart Grew trii sizz dat day!
An da minute 'is 'eart didn't feel qwite so tight,
Ee whizzeded wif 'is load thruu da bright mornin' lite,
An ee brought back da toys! An da grub fer da feast!

The Gnrunch my parody of the grinch Ebry uumie Down in 'ivecity Liked Christmas lots...
But da Gnrunch,Who lived jus' nord o' 'Ivecity, Did NUB!
Da Gnrunch 'ated Christmas! Da whole Christmas season!
Nows, ...wimper... pleez donz ask why. No wun qwite knows da reason.
It cud be 'is 'ed wasn't screweded on jus' roight.
It cud be, perhaps, dat 'is shoes woz too tight.
But meeb tink dat da most likelee reason o' awl,
May ab bin dat 'is 'eart was twuu sizz too bitty.
Worrevver da reason, 'Is 'eart or 'is shoes,
Ee stud der on Christmas Eve, 'ating da Uumies,
Starin' down from 'is cave wif a sour, Gnrunchy frown,
At da warm lighteded windows below in their town.
Fer ee knew ebry Uumie down in 'Ivecity benead,
Was busy nows, 'anging a mistletoe wread.
"An deyz 'anging their stockin's!" ee snarleded wif a snea,
"Tomorrow iz Christmas! S'practicaley 'ere!"
Den ee growleded, wif 'is Gnrunch fingaz nervouslee drummin',
"meeb MUST find sum way ter stop Christmas from comin'!"
Fer Tomorrow, ee knew, awl da Uumie girls an boyz,
Wuud wake bright an urly. They'd rush fer their toys!
An den! Oh, da noiz! Oh, da Noiz!
Noiz! Noiz! Noiz!
Datz wun fing ee 'ated! Da NOIZ!
NOIZ! NOIZ! NOIZ!
Den da Uumies, young an ole, wuud sqwat down ter a feast.
An they'd feast! An they'd feast! An they'd FEAST!
FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
They wuud feast on puddin', an rair roast biisty.
Which was sumthing da Gnrunch couldn't stand in da least!
An DEN They'd du sumthing Ee liked least o' awl!
Ebry Uumie down in 'Ivecity, da tall an da bitty,
Wuud stand close togevva, wif Christmas bells ringin'.
They'd stand 'and-in-hand. An da Uumies wuud start sqwaakin!
They'd sqwaak! An they'd sqwaak! An they'd SQWAAK!
SQWAAK! SQWAAK! SQWAAK!
An da more da Gnrunch thoght o' dis Uumie Christmassin',
Da more da Gnrunch thoght, "meeb must stop dis whole fing!"
"Why, fer fifty-threy years me've put up wif it nows!"
"meeb MUST stop dis Christmas from comin'! But OW?"
Den ee got an idea! An awful idea!
DA GNRUNCH GOT A WONDAFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
"meeb knowz jus' wot ter du!" Da Gnrunch laugheded in 'is throat.
An ee made a qwick Santy Claus 'at an a coat.
An ee chuckleded, an cluckeded, "Wot a great Gnrunchy trikk!"
"Wif dis coat an dis 'at, meeb look jus' loike Saint Nikk!"
"Awl meeb need iz a reindea..." Da Gnrunch looked around.
But, since reindea are scarce, der was nun ter be found.
Did dat stop da ole Gnrunch? No! Da Gnrunch simplee said,
"If meeb can't find a reindea, me'll make wun instead!"
So ee called 'is Sqwig, Max. Den ee took sum red thread,
An ee tied a big 'orn on da top o' 'is 'ed.
DEN Ee loaded sum bags An sum ole empty sacks,
Ona ramshackle sleigh An ee clompched up ole Max.
Den da Gnrunch said, "WAAAAGH!" An da sleigh starteded down,
Tword da 'omes werr da Uumies Lay asnooze in their town.
Awl their windows woz dark. Qwiet snow filled da air.
Awl da Uumies woz awl dreamin' sweet dreams wif'out cair.
Wen ee came ter da furst lil' 'owse on da sqware.
"Dis iz stop numba wun," da ole Gnrunchy Klaws 'issed,
An ee climbeded ter da roof, empty bags in 'is fist.
Den ee slid down da smoke belcher. A ravva tight pinch.
But, if Santa cud du it, den so cud da Gnrunch.
Ee got stuck onlee wunce, fer a momunt or twuu.
Den ee stuck 'is 'ed outa da fireplace flue.
Werr da lil' Uumie stockin's awl 'ung in a row.
"Theyz stockin's," ee grinneded, "are da furst stuff ter go!"
Den ee slivvereded an slunk, wif a smile most unpleasant,
Around da whole room, an ee took ebry per-sent!
Pop shootaz! An bicyclz! Rolla skatz! Drums!
Checkerboards! Tricyclz! Popcorn! An plums!
An ee stuffeded dim in bags. Den da Gnrunch, very nimblee,
Stuffeded awl da bags, wun by wun, up da smoke belcher!
Den ee slunk ter da icebox. Ee took da Uumies' feast!
Ee took da puddin'! Ee took da roast biisty!
Ee cleaneded owt dat icebox as qwick as a flash.

Major issues with my PC, afraid of it being nigh-unfixable. To all who read this,

I hope this day finds you well. I’m having a highly aggravating issue that started a few months ago and has steadily worsened. See, the gaming computer my dad and I made half a year ago started to experience random shutdowns sometime in January of this year. The first time it happened I was confused, but believed it to be a bizarre mistake (I’m very noobish with PCs; this is the first one I’ve ever had for myself) and carried on. Nowadays it’ll shut off without anything being done, even if it’s left alone. It even seems to happen in specific intervals, with noticeable patterns.

When playing a game like War Thunder, Space Hulk: Deathwing, or something else with decent graphics, the first shutdown occurs seemingly a few minutes after startup. The second shutdown is a bit more variable, but can occur during startup, during a match, or just as I launch the game and get to the hangar. The third is either very much like the previous two or doesn’t occur for a solid hour and a half/two hours. The rest from there is variable but still in a bit of a pattern, with some taking as long as the third and others happening the literal instant the computer turns back on in a swift manner- three or four times really.

I’m irritated beyond words whenever this occurs. I mainly play games like World of Tanks and War Thunder, where it doesn’t just “stop” due to being multiplayer. In WoT, your tank is still in the game and is a sitting duck for anybody to hit, and if I was moving before the shut down I often end up driving right into enemy fire and get killed before I can regain control. In War Thunder you just die- this has had a severe effect on my ability to play, contribute well, have fun, and just improve myself.

Specs are as follows:

Intel Core i5 6600K Skylake CPU

Gigabyte GA-Z170XP-SLI Motherboard

Kingston HyperX FURY Black 8GB Kit (2x4GB) 2133MHz CL14 DDR4

MSI R9-390 8GB Gaming Graphics Card

Samsung 850 Series 256GB SSD

Western Digital Black WD1003FZEX 1TB 7200rpm 3.5” HDD

ASUS SATA DVD RW 24x (I never use this, so it shouldn’t be interrupting anything.)

Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO

Fractal DesignArc Midi R2

Corsair CS Series 550w Modular PSU (CS550M)

The computer runs on Windows 10. It's custom made, so I'm unsure of their being any kind of product number.

Other parts include a Logitech mouse, a Benq desktop monitor, and Sennheiser headset. I don’t know how any of these could be influencing the issue I’m facing as they are all external. Keyboard is also Logitech.

An interesting note: Once, out of extreme frustration, I ended up gently pressing the frontal end of the case to my right- the part with the DVD faces outwards of my desk, and when I did that the computer came back on far faster than it had before. Today when this issue occurred again I decided to test a little theory and tapped the computer away from the front- it did nothing. When I went for the front left side it came back immediately. I find this interesting because there was an issue sometime where my power button sank too low due to being subjected to too much pressure; my dad and I got it back up as high as we could so that I could still press it. Could it have something to do with the button’s awkward position?

I also thought it was dust at first, but after cleaning it out and even doing a test drive with the side open it still shut of six or seven minutes after turning it on and beginning War Thunder.

I don’t know what to do and I’m at my wit’s end. This has been going on and it’s more irritating every single time it happens. What’s happened to this thing? Is there something I’m missing?

Thank you for your time,

TitanBrass

-----

This is a post from I put onto r/techsupport a year ago, and it’s still rather accurate. However, a far worse side effect has made itself known- I am legitimately losing saves in games like BFGA after shutoffs. I don’t just mean a little bit of memory loss, I mean *the admiral* is GONE, like he wasn’t there to begin with. They have also gotten more frequent, and now the computer has an issue where if I play anything for long enough it gets super hot. I’m starting to think it’s my MSI, but I’m not allowed to have it replaced. If that’s what’s wrong with it, I’m completely screwed.

For the love of God, help me with this. I can't even start up Total War: Warhammer II beyond the menu because it shuts off.

Sincerely,

TitanBrass

My invasion build (SL50) So I've been running this invader build for about 30+ hours now and I'm just absolutely in love with it. Started mercenary and now I kinda invested in int for a bit to get magic weapon and hidden body.

Name Senua of Vinhiem
Stats
VIG-23 ATT-14 END-11 VIT-25 STR-18 DEX-16 INT-15 FAI-8 LUC-9

Spells- great magic weapon and hidden body (kek)

Equipment, armour Alva helm, Knight chest, mirrah chain gloves, Alva leggings.

Wot rings you got bitch? Hornet, obscuring, silver cat, untrue dark

Weapons using RAW +4 halberd RAW +4 Dragonslayer axe and a fire dagger +4. Llewellyn shield plus 4 with a simple enchantment and just a +4 sorcerers staff.

I invade mostly irithyll/catacombs/demon ruins. Really like how weird the one handed halberd strikes are. They are so slow so everyone rolls or parries to early to actually Dodge it. Little them down with the halberd bthen just party them for the kill with the Dragonslayer  axe or the dagger. Looking to maybe improve it a little bit. So far I'm getting great results with magic weapon on the halberd/axe

Da night before Krismas ‘Twas da noight before humie Krismas, when all frough da WAAAAAAGH!,
Not a git was stirrin’, not even a ZOG!
Da red stockings was hung to make Santa go fasta,
In hopes dat he’d bring da good gits some new dakka,
Da gretchins was all nestled up in deir beds,
While blastajets and battlewagons WAAGHED through deir ‘eads,
And da painboy wid ‘is choppa, and I wid’ my squig,
‘ad just settled down to blow up somethin’ big,
When out in da trenches dere was a big noise,
So I picked up some rokkits and yelled for da boyz,
Away to da boomy platform I ran like a git,
Shootin’ my slugga and lookin for somefin to hit,
Da bad moon was lookin’ down at da new fallen humies,
And it lit up da ‘splosions and rokkits and boomies,
When, wot to my big nob eyes should appear,
But a floatin’ trukk wid pointy ‘orses pullin a bag full o’ gear,
Wid a big humie driver who didn’t look so mean,
I sure was glad dat it wasn’t Celestine,
Fasta than dakkajets ‘is floaty box came,
An’ he whistled and called da pointy ‘orses by name,
So up to da battlefortress da pointy ‘orses flew,
Wid a trukk full o’ dakka and Saint Fatdakka too:
And den in da quiet I ‘eard on da roof,
Da stompin’ and rompin’ of dey little hoofs.
As I put away da slugga and turned around,
Down da boomy platform came Saint Fatdakka wid a bound:
‘e was covered in red, from ‘ead to foots,
An’ he was dusty wid’ Armageddon soot;
A bundle o’ dakka was flung on ‘is back,
And ‘e looked like a big mek openin’ ‘is pack:
‘is eyes was merry,
‘is nose was a cherry,
An’ ‘is beard was white like da moon after a shower,
And ‘is eye was metal and red, full o’ krismassy power,
And smoke from da dakka circled ‘is ‘ead,
And ‘e looked as smoky as a deff dread,
He ‘ad a big powa klaw dat shook when ‘e laughed,
An’ I laughed while I watched ‘im amid da Armageddon blasts,
A lazer from ‘is eye and a twist o’ his ‘ead,
Soon let me know dat I was da one to dread.
He didn’t say nuffin, but went straight to work,
And gave us loads o’ dakka; then turn’d wid a jerk,
‘e laid his finger on his humie nose
And winked at da nobz, and up da boomy platform ‘e rose.
He ‘opped in ‘is dakkatrukk, all glimmerin’ wid’ gold,
And away ‘e flew to moar boyz young an’ old,
But I ‘eard him yellin’ as he drove out of sight,
“FIRE ON MY POSITION,” an’ I knew it would be a fun night.

P2118 throttle body actuator Throttle actuator control motor current range/performance. Merry Christmas everyone. I'm going crazy. I have the throttle cable spacer mod, &amp; I never modified my pedal for that.  I heard you're supposed to do another modification to your gas pedle stopper along with that mod to prevent damage to your throttle body. I think I have done this damage while @ WOT a few days ago. I wanted to see a flame out my exhaust , &amp; definitely succeeded with that. But now when I start my car, the rev's start @ like 2,000 &amp; just climb. Even without the throttle cable connected. Super sketchy. Before when I was troubleshooting, I noticed it wouldn't climb, but just be completed dead until I put my foot completely to the floor.  I need to know which part in the throttle body I broke.. so I know what to order... ASAP. I think it's the part closest the the cable. This is my DD &amp; I'm scared to start it.. I've cleaned all connections &amp; checked the fuse box in the bay. Are there any more fuses I should check?

Ok. A little post on why i think the ability to bite heads off is the best superpower there is. Ok. A little post on why i think the ability to bite heads off is the best superpower there is. People are always liek ayy i  wanna fly go invisible if i had superpowers but no, the ability to bite off ones head is simply the most powerful, frightening and effective superpower there is. Picture this, you're at school and in an argument with someone whom you really dont like. They wont shut the fuck up and you cant stand it, so you lean in and simply whisper "u wot m8" as your jaws extend to an incredible size and your incisors morph into 6 inch dagger sized canined as you clamp your jaws shut around the fuckhead's head. You stare triumphantly as his headless faceless corpse falls to the ground with a slight smirk on your now normal face. Everyone else just stares in horror. Some girls scream, the teacher rushes in,  and calls the police. No worries, you bite their heads off too. Everyone is shocked. People dont even try to stop you because they're just too damn afraid. The principal expels you. You go to her office, and bite her head off. The next day you appear in class. Everyone stops what they are doing as they look at you. No one questions your presence, no one says anything if you dont do your work, no one tries to annoy you or oppose you, because you'd just bite their head off. Now picture this, its lunch break and people are talking too much. This annoying guy is sitting with his butt on YOUR table. Thats right, YOUR table. But this time, you dont bite his head off, you stand up, take in a deep breath, and loudly announce "I...am hungry..". The entire class stands still in horror. Everyone lookig at your eyes to see the potential victim, however, you turn to him, and smile. Do nothing but smile. Before you can make a move, he has collapsed. And that is why biting heads off is simply the single most effective superpower the average teenager needs. No ones gonna mess with you. Everyone's your bitch. You're unstoppable. All heads are yours. See a guy thats minding his own business but HOW DARE HE BREATHE YOUR AIR. Bite his head off. Why say "fuck off" when you can say "Ill bite your head off"?In short, you bite heads off, you're the boss.

Done with it all. Hey there everyone! Totally new to this and usually I'd feel nervous but tonight's free game baby! So here it is for all its worth:
I was born in Miami, FL and only lived there till I was 5. My dad was Jamaican AND a rastafarian, so he believed in the whole repatriation to Ethiopia thing. To each their own. But he had issues that I hadn't known about and for the longest time I was always throwing fits and temper tantrums just so I could go back to my dear old dad. My poor mother was working 2 jobs at the time and going to school (so I was told when I got grew a little older) as well as having 2 kids already and pregnant with a 4th. My mothers dating history started with my dad and ever since (until about 2 years ago) her choice in men have pretty non-reliable as, as the nicest way to put it. So she had all this going on and I still would act out and sure i was a child i didn't know, but damn me if I dont regret it now eh? Anyways long story short she sent to him with a one way ticket, hoping that I would get better.
As soon as my plane touched down and I was in the airport all the excitement I had felt started to gush out. "What would my new home be like?" "My dad's probably really cool right?" "Cant wait to make new friends!" All this plus some. And the incident that changed that was over food. The simplest bloody thing you could have an argument about right? Basically for a very long time he was some kind of advanced vegan. He did not eat touch or even look at anything that had touched a fire or pot in some way. He was raw to the core and wanted me to live that way as well. I didn't understand this (I was 7 at the time) and at the time his ex was over cooking for herself and I had asked if I could have some. That was the first time I felt true fear. He had shot me a look of murder across the room just for that. And then it really started to escalate after that. Here's 3 juicy tidbits that happened while I was in my beautiful prison.
1. We were in the capital of Ethiopia (for those who dont know its Adis Abeba) and at this time he had caved a little from the constant uh....."discipline" he had to dish out to one person (I'm pretty stubborn) so he started to allow peanut butter and bread (like I said ANYTHING that touched a fire yeah?). He had finally bought some peanut butter to go with the bread and I was just so elated plus slightly hungry from just working all day. So I did what any kid would do amd opened it, stuck my finger in the container and took a nice big helping of peanut butter. Wrong move man. Oh and wrong timing too. See my dad was kinda fucked in the head. Hed wait, and watch and watch and watch and spy until you did something wrong. And woe to you when he finally caught you. As he did me. Now I do want to note that one of his dearest old friends were their and they saw my face swollen on one side when he got out from the store. He asked what had happened and my dear father said I was stealing! Now i would like to preface this by saying that he doesn't eat the shit. I do. He bought it for me because beating me into submission everyday and being the center of gossip was tiring (we lived in a pretty tight community and not tight in the good sense.)
So like every other do good soul out there he stayed out of it. Even when you could slice the tension in the air. You could smell my fear and you could feel the heat of his anger. I knew what was coming, but damn, I didn't know it would've been that bad.
So we get home he parks, tells me to go to my room and pull my pants down. Alright done and done, I'm thinks belt so meh shouldn't hurt that much right? Haha right. My dude comes in with a long metal pipe for heavy duty plumbing. Yep metal, not PVC. So I start panicking and pleading for mercy, just for it to fall on deaf ears. So the beating lasted around 20 minutes and somewhere in the middle I begin to experience what I can explain what feels like fainting (which I have never and still haven't surprisingly enough) and ask for water as I'm dehydrated. At this point I've dashed away my pride just so I could quench my thirst and am pleading begging for water. What does my dearest father do? He spits in my mouth and tells me to swallow. And I did. Now I have welt on my lower left buttock as a constant reminder. Funny right? I lol at it myself sometimes haha. Oh I was about 8 or 9 then.
2. This was when I was about 10 or 12 cant really recall and my grandmother had sent me some money to spend for my b-day. I bought some cookies hoping to hide and eat them and he wouldn't find out. At this point in life I was stealing, lying and manipulating people. I learned from the best, my father and some of his shitty exes (yeah both my parents had bad taste in the opposite sex, shocker eh?). So i had alot of beatings under my belt. But guess what my "friends" sold me out! Why you ask? Simple they thought we were rich. The context for that is my father, for all of his shortcomings was a damn good worker and was the most successful one in our little Shashemene (our town). So everyone around me was trying to fuck us over, manipulate us and l, well you know the usual trashy things humans do for money, fame or power.
And people knew just how to get to me. By this time everyone knew I was the reject that kept getting his ass beat. And everyone "sympathized " but not enough to involve themselves. And they knew food was the biggest problem. So they entice me with all the tastes and smells of good food and ask me questions. And I gave them willingly. Also note most of them were single women with and without kids. More on that later yeah?
So yeah, friends sold me out withou me knowing it, and my father played the game of "wheres the rest of the money" till I personally fessed up. And then he told me he already knew. And I knew he hated, even abhorred lying and stealing. Most people do right? Not like him. He hated that shit with a burning passion. Basically I had made it 10 times worse by not telling him the first time he asked. That spring he had bought me a tool set so I could be more "creative and less destructive" to put it in his words. In that toolset was a small hammer. He beat me till I was black and blue all over. Including the face. The next day he had business to do in the capital so he dragged me with him because he didn't trust me at all by myself (he hadn't for while though) and made me cayy all the heavy bags and once even flagged a taxi down and told me to "hurry my ass up or I'll leave your ass". This of course was a scare tactic that was and would be used continuously. The funny part? Everyone, everywhere we went saw me and said nothing. The few that did got told some shitty lie and told to mind their own business an order they gladly complied with.
3. Not the least and definitely not the last was the time before he had caved in to my food demands (apologies for the out of order type writing) and had caught me eating what is know as Injera amd Wot (it's one of the staples of Ethiopian food culture). So my great God fearing father bought what I could only look back and estimate as maybe a third of a large barrel of bread and told me to eat every last one when he gets back. After about, oh I dont know, say 30 of them going down my gullet, i felt the urge to vomit. And i did. He had heard of course (mans was probably behind the door getting of to my suffering, hell if I know) and come out just to tell me that now that I had done it on the tray I was eating out of, to eat the puke as well as the bread that's left. As i started to set out upon this quest, a different friend of his (I still remember his tall lanky coward ass) came around for some weed from what I could hear (I mean we're all Jamaican what do ya expect eh?) and they proceed to do their thing. Now I have know this man since I got there. He was one of the friends that was part of my welcoming committee at the airport. I had called this walking sack of shite uncle for Christ's sake man! And he sees what I'm having to endure and does nothing. Nothing. I mean im in the middle of drinking vomit from a tray and this dude walks up sees me and goes about his business. Left in the same way. No eye contact. In sure as hell he didn't mistake the pulse for a bloody protein shake right? Riiiigghhht. After I finished that was that. I saw him a couple of times after that and still called him uncle, shoot he even took me for a ride on this dope motorcycle he had. Then again kid me was trying to please everyone and thing because obviously my own father hated my guts.
So for some context yeah? Whyd you never go to the police? What other people outside your community? Haha well you gotta understand that Ethiopia is....different. Especially Shashemene. Most of us knew each other and our personal lives. The police didn't have much of a presence there until around 2010 or 12 and by then I was used to it. And i really dont wanna sound like some DC or Marvel reject (love both of em by the way! Especially Marvel. Dont exactly know what the hell the DC universe is thinking with the movies they released recently lol) but my father knew alot of the police AND soldiers l. Also I dont know my father's story. He told me he never had a dad and some other tidbits from his past with his mom. I guess our relationship git so bad we stopped talking about anything real. It was just going through the motions day after day. So telling the authorities was out of the question. So instead I resorted to running away. First time was scary as hell, second time I was getting used to it and by the upteenth time I had done it I was using the tactics he taught to survive in the wild to live. I remember one time we were in Wondo Genet (a paradise for tourists because of the amazing hot springs in and around the dormant [or inactive?] volcano in our back yard, yes he had multiple residences. 3 to be exact.) and I had packed my things for 20th time and left. I was going to the shitty school there at the time and was living in the mountains and going to school. When he figured that out there was no beating because he at least respected me for that. I laugh looking back at it now haha. The same guy who would hold me high on a wall choking me out because I got a multiplication equation wrong for the tenth time was proud of me huh? Lol sure mate.
Anywho, fast forward a little to the bug incident that finally got me out of that living hell. I had done something ir other that got me in trouble for....ahhhhhh fuck it at that point I'd lost count. I didn't give a shit. I hated him. No, I loathed him. He was beating on me again and I had had enough. I screamed "I hate you!" at the top of my lungs and bolted. His current wife (who hes had 3 kids with now and going strong) had to hold him down to not chase me and let tall you she is a small and skinny woman. But a heart of gold. I put her through so much shit. But like everyone she gave up, especially when she realized she was with child. At that point I became footnote. A pebble on the side of the road not worth picking up. And let me tell how glad I am that she did hold him back. I am no God fearing man with all that I've been through and that day I prayed. Oh boy I prayed. Because she and I both knew that if she did not hold him down I would be either in hospital to this very day or dead. And when she did let him go his bloodcurdling roar could be heard from the other valley. Maybe it was the fear os a child at the time that made it seem so terrifying, but that's how I saw it, felt it and heard it. I knew u had to go ASAP. Long story short I bounced around till I met someone who had recently moved there and knew my mother. That stroke of luck only lasted till I could call her and tell her what had been happening. Because at that point I thought I was free of him and fuck it I'll take it out on everyone that didn't help. So I stole, lied and manipulated everyone around me till they were fed up and also had the info they wanted to get "rich". And then just like that I had nowhere left to go. Friends didn't want me around. Parents didn't want around their children as I was the devil child (one of many creative nicknames). And people I looked up to in turn looked down on me.
Now for some more context. My father was not rich by any means. He was a workaholic and that's how he dealt with his emotions, which by the way he doesn't believe in. He know emotions are real he just doesn't acknowledge them. It's like this dude came out of a time capsule from the 1800's or something haha. Like we all know the society in America for men is to "suck it up" right? Well my father took that and cranked the insanity to 100. I was never really allowed to Express emotions and for the longest time I was homeschooled and wasn't allowed any, let me repeat ANY friends. I was locked in a room more than once as punishment, sometimes for weeks on end. At least that's what it felt like. To give even more insight people feared my dad. I dont know why. He os not that buff, although he practices martial arts, hes not towering Jason Momoa or Tom Hardy. Dude was just average body wise. But they feared him. I have seen people cross the bloody street when they see this man. That's why I was manipulated by others, not only because they knew my weakness but also because they were to afraid to try and manipulate him. Because for the people that have done it, they were made an example of. I always had the sneaking suspicion that he was some kind of gangster in Ethiopia, especially after he had told me once that he use to do fucked up things in Jamaica. And Jamaica at the time he was from, was rampant with gangs and crime.
So then I finally get to America, living in Eugene OR with my mom. Things were tricky at first but I thought they'd get better. I didn't realize that the whole Ethiopia experience had ruined me emotional and mentally (not so much physically because my father knew how to beat so it wouldn't show.) so as my mother is making plans to get into what I think is the only community college there and trying to help me adapt something inside me was stirring.
I started college, got my GED and then said you know I've always loved engineering and building stuff let's major in that! Realized how hard the math was and dropped out. I have very bad, for lack of a better word, PTSD from having to do math with my father. I wouldn't have fit or mental breakdown or anything because I was hard drilled taught to be reserved and unnerved by anything and for the most part I am. Instead it would just be a mental blocking couldn't figure out tough equations no matter how hard I tried. And when my mother or her husband tried to help me I woul revert back to 8 and do that thing you do where act like you know the answer trying to coax them to say it and then write it down. So yeah after that tried a different college, different major, same result. But before that I was acting like I was going to the community college but instead went to the public library with a laptop that my grandmother had bought me and played skyrim (400+ hours baby! Haha I know alot of you probably have more though). When my ma found out she was furious and grounded me. Now I was 17 at the time and think I knew everything, like we all did once, and thought my laptop right? You didn't by it, so therefore it's not yours to take right? Wrong. She found out that I had been taking it with yet still, and got livid. For about 2 years we were at each other's throats, sometimes over big issues and sometimes over nothing at all. Now my mother is Puerto Rican and native american mixed but dominantly Puerto Rican. And we can be a little...intense that la chan cla shit is meme for a reason shit's true you. The mothers go ape on their kids sometimes. But we know its from a good place even if we dont know it then. So both she and I have said some pretty hurtful things. I remember 2 times specifically that I think we broke each other's hearts. First was when she said she would slap me. Now on the plain to America something changed. I used to be this major extrovert with tons and tons of friends. When I got in that plain I vowed I would carry my anger and hatred with me and use it on anyone who would dare to lay there hands on me. Even blood family. And I told her that, maybe not in the same words, with vehemence and a snarl. I truly felt viscous then. Now to reverse it on to me. I was walking from the kitchen and into me and my brother room (I have 2 brothers and sister on her side) and u hear her talking to one of her best friends about me. So I did what any self-loathing curious teen would do and listened in. She was saying that this "bitch" says he is gonna lay his hands on me! Girl, he dont know me! I'll straight kill him in his sleep and wont wake up the next day! I'll through some heavy shit at him while he ain't and hope for brain damage.
At this point I was in the hall in full view. To this day I dont know if she saw me or was staring at the tv to intently to notice. At that point I realized both my parents are fucked. Oh by this time I was 18 .
Here comes my 19th b-day tall! Man I was so excited. I had job I had some friends l I was still awkward but people accepted me. It was this place called Papas Pizza and god it felt good to be involved in something again. Plus ali was going to therapy but that ended within the year as the therapist I had gotten close and comfortable with left to do private practice. Ma tried to force me to go to others but I wasn't feeling it.
But of course even that I managed to fuck up. Part of the please everyone was still in me so I took on shifts in hopes I could get in better standing with people. Maybe it was depression, or maybe I was and am still truly crazy but at the time I thought people would make fun of me behind my back. But I kept silent.
And of course there were heartbreaks. What's a shitlife like mine without em eh? And I was so stupid and I'll equipped socially to deal with any of them . I'm sure most of you guys have heard of incels and nice guys right? Well I was one. A nice guy to be exact. Constantly going on about how I take people's shifts and be nice and I dont...well sex. Maybe that's not exactly what i was hoping for at the time, but you know in the long run as far as I can equate that's kinda what that culture boils down to. And as much as I still think that time of my life was cringy, I thank every deity out there that I was as toxic as some of the posts I've seen in reddit. Thank you. To continue, there was one girl that didn't want to date me because I smoked weed. That's fine right? To each their own? But my dumbass couldn't take a hint, so ruined that chance. Then there was another girl that started working there. She was lesbian. At least so she claimed. We hung out go to know each other a bit and I learned she had....issues. in short she cut....alot. Here comes captain "save a whoe" to the rescue. Not that she was a bad person, it's just the term I have learned to use for my unhealthy preference in the opposite sex. I told here how I felt about her and she said no we can be friends though. And I was fine with that, until I learned from a different friend months later that she and someone I considered a friend were dating. I was hurt. But right now I'm too numb to feel anything. I guess all I could say now is that I hope it has worked out and they are happy. Truly. Last but not least was a tall beautiful girl with tiger tattoo on her back (or shoulder sorry cant remember). She was someone who seriously did check for me. Shoot we even cuddled and watched goonies together because I never had. Her mom was really chill too. And she was probably expecting something to happen from that, but no I was too pussy, too scared to take initiative. And in the end I moved and we grew apart. I went Alaska to fish for 2 months. Gillnetting specifically. Then the Bahamas to visit my grandmother. Then miami because my mother had moved. But if your not rich or retired and rich theres not much to do. Especially when you dont know much people. At least that's my take on it, I'm no einstein. Then it was to Seattle. But I was living in an SRO apartment with an elderly black gentleman I had met while there from Alaska. That's a big no no and he and I could have been on the streets for it. And even though he was giving everything I was still selfish. I didn't care. But between having to constantly look over my shoulders and the 9-5 buss boy job I was working in a pretty uptown place called the Daily Grill. Another thing I fucked up. Good pay good tips. You just had to work hard. Still couldn't stick it.
So one day I was like fuck ill do what I've always done. Run. And I did just that; packed my things and left. Never told the poor man who would be worried anything until just this year. I left to travel the U.S., to find my purpose in life before i truly off myself. That was a time i was looking for help, screaming internally for it even, but just didn't know where to look.
That's how i ended up here in Portland working as a graveyard desk clerk at the Fairfield. When I got here I was homeless of course, but I didn't know that Portland was the haven for it. Hell my plan was make a put stop in LA and then keep it moving but the train was down for the next 3 weeks. So I went to the Protland Rescue Mission amd entered the connect program. Basically you do daily chores and call a company named TPI every week until your number is called up and you move out of there and into your own place to start finding work, because you are not allowed to work while in the program.  This was to help avoid outside distractions. Why you ask? Well there were alot of addicts in the program. Now I am an addict as well but have been lucky enough for to to only go as far as weed, alchohol (mainly whiskey) and benadryl/nyquil.  Never got to the heavy shit out there and now never will. I had seen alot of people come and go some friends some strangers. I finally graduated the program and even though it wasn't an apartment per se I was glad I was out a could make my own money again.
Then my mother contacts me. We had been speaking on and off for a while and when she called this time it was about trimming weed in California. I thought, hey that right down my alley! Grew up with fields of it played with ate it, drank it, shit I live it. So I drop everything and go. Long story short l, if your new to the scene (from the employers perspective), dont have your own equipment, and are slow then pay wise your fucked. I thought it was going to be an easy going job that pays alot. Of course I knew there was farm work but I grew up on that so no biggie yeah? Nope.
So i go let back to Portland with some money in my pocket and when i had left i had 3 good friends that i had kept in contact with. One lived in an apartment and the other was getting one the last was going through some marital issues. All in all i got a job through a company named IPM switched properties and am now here. I live where I used to work. And from my perspective it's a borderline insane asylum. Now I want to stress that I am no expert and I have studied shite, but I have lived it. And it seems to me that certain people just want to get some of the crazies off the street stick em in a place while they are on meds and forget about them till it wears off and we the workers have to deal with it, unless it gets drastic. Then the police are involved.
So now I sit here behind my desk typing all this. Sorry if it's been very, very long but I had to get all this off my chest before ending it all.
You know someth .....uh ng I really truly dont tell most people? Back in Ethiopia I took in the violent tendencies of my great father and abused animals. To the at where I have mercilessly killed defenceless, new born pups, and 1 cat. I dont remember those numbers because it feels good to reminisce. I constantly remind my self to make myself remember that I am no better than anyone. I had a pit-terrier while living where I'm at and had to put her down because her last 2 owners were abusive. I tried l, God know I tried to give her the life she never had. But she ended up but someone's dog and at that point had but more than once. Yes I got defensive and not in a healthy way either. So I had to put her down. No adoption would take a violent dog. Especially when theres a stigma against pits. At least that's what I tell myself to help me sleep at night haha. Currently I have a beautiful pit-lab mix. All of him chocolate colored and he is such a lover. Recently rescued from being a stray, and because of that needs training. Its been about 4-5 months since I've had him and just called the shelter to take him back. Why? Why would I do something like that to this poor guy? Because I fear that if I keep him, between my selfishness and my anger issues I will hurt him. I've already had to walk away after beating. I feel disgusted with myself. I'm turning into the very thing I swore I would never be. Something I detest. So add hypocrite to the list of things I label myself too. Do I want pity? Sure who doesn't, shit I wont lie for the longest time that was the game I played. Till I realized not only does the shit get old, but people have kids and family's to care about. When shit gets real bad they have to be there for them, not you. So more and more over the years I've learned to shut up and take it up the ass from life. And at times I mentally beat myself up because I feel that what little I'm going through in my life is a lot better to people, let's say who survived a war or people who had to get limbs amputated, or children going the same if not worse, experiences I had when younger. This is not a plea for help, I just hope someone reads this to learn from my shortcomings. I still dont seek help because by now these negative feelings have become my crutch. I'm too afraid to live, and convinced that I wont find it anyway. Especially since I dont like going to public places. I like to see it as a hikikomori, who instead of never going out, I just go out when I absolutely have to. I put up this facade for the world that I'm strong and silent, but inside I just want to be dead. I have tried many a time to find meaning in life. Infact for a little while I even started believing I could love and be loved again. Then when I told that person how I felt about I was turned down...yet again. It hurt. I thought I had gotten used to. This was beginning of this year. I still hurt. And that added with multiple other rejections in life and only seen as good enough to be a friend, I just shut everything out. I didn't and still dont care about much. And to avoid being hurt physically, mentally, or emotionally again I decided not to get close to people. I have 3 friends and that's all I need. But humans are social creatures and I wanted, so badly, to be accepted and loved. But oh well for some it's not made for them and I've come to accept that. Doesn't mean I have to physically live with it though right?
And now for the finale.
To anyone that has read this whether we happen to know each other or not, do not try to talk me out of it. Maybe some you know that peaceful feeling that you get when you have finally decided to end it all and maybe you dont. But it sure is strange. I havent felt this happy or peaceful in so long and I would like that last. My only worry is that, well, growing up in a religion you're scared straight when it come to suicide. I for one rather not end up in hell. I kinda believe in it and I kinda dont at the same time, either I really rather not end up there.
As far as i know from research i can buy a gun in OR without a permit, and it's only going to be one time use so need to worry there. If, for some reason I cant get a hold of one then I'll just have to sever an artery or two.why haven't I done after all this time? Simple. I'm too much of a pussy. I can dole out punches and I can last in a street fight (courtesy of my father) but i could never bring my self to slit my own throat or wrists. But i can hurt an animal right? Ha its laughable. I really have turned into the same psycho that raised me.
And THAT doesn't end up happening well then I guess I'll be ghosting again. No trace, no telling anyone just they way I like it. Not much people would miss if I was gone anywas.
Thanks for reading, hope you have better life/day that I've had and i do truly wish you all a happy new year.
Adios

How to break-in a rebuilt engine I've read a lot of contradictory information about this online and most of it is 10+ years old info so I thought I'd ask here.


I have a 1.4 TSI twin-charged engine in a VW scirocco and I plan to replace piston + piston rings.


1. Can I use synthetic oil after the rebuild?


Some say it's fne since cars come from factory with synthetic regardless, some say to use mineral first 500 kms then do an oil change, fill up with mineral again, go 1000 km, do again an oil change then turn to synthetic and pretty much 1000 dfferent versions of this story.


2. How long should I break it in? Do I need to change the oil afterwards?

3. I want to change the injectors too in the near future (say 1-2 months after the rebuild) as a preventive measure since the ones I have are notorious for being shit and causing premature wear to the pistons, would it make a difference if I were to change the injectors when I change the pistons+rings or it's absolutely np to change them 1-2 months after?


My plan was to use synthetic oil off the bat, drive it mostly in the city or windy roads until I burn 2 tanks of gas (800-1000 miles?), vary RPM a lot, don't go over 3.5kish RPM, don't go WOT, as few cold starts as possible, do an oil change (unless you guys say it's not necessary) and hurray, engine's broken in.


Is it anything wrong with what I'm planning to do? I really need a definitive answer since everyone's got a personal opinion regarding what oil to use, how long to break in, how many times to change the oil etc etc and I started to overthink this a lot.

Exhaust question I have a 2014 mustang gt. For its whole life I ran off-road x-pipe with roush axle back. That shit was loud. I live in Cali and some cops are assholes so i was very hesitant about going WOT. I recently bought the borla s-types and like the sound of them, but their a bit quieter than i expected. What do you guys think? Go back to roush? Or do a resonator delete on the Borlas? I just want some opinions, any help would be great, thanks!!

My family RULES ahaha! Since my first post here about a week ago, my relatives have been buying me 100% vegan food. The type that has the little V symbol on it? Everything they know I'd eat! Probiotic yogurts, macadamia milk, rice &amp; walnut milk (tastes just like maple syrup, in my opinion), all types of fruits and vegetables, hearts of palm, hearts of artichoke, smoothie mixes, ice creams, protein supplements and Textured Vegetable Protein, the whole nine yards. For Christmas they got me cruelty-free, vegan cosmetics (Hard Candy, Wet 'n' Wild, random soaps from Etsy if I had to guess) and faux fleexe leggings. I'm like.. wot. These people have never put forth that much effort, but now suddenly the refrigerator and freezer are **loaded** with my favorite foods, and things I never even tried! I'm going to throw them a feast tonight! :D

Epic Quest: The Card Wot Tells Stories I love Epic Quest!

Ever since I saw the card I was enamoured with the design. The last deck I bought I cracked an Epic Quest deck with only 4 knights. At first I thought omg I will never pull this off. But after many games I found I could pull it off like 30% of the time, and much more likely if I can send 3 of my 4 knights off questing. On average 2.

Anyway, I love the STORIES Epic Quest plays tell!

Once I spent half the game playing out slowly, with 2 knights off questing. I had 2 keys to my opponent's 2, and I finally find 5 Sanctum cards in hand. The opponent was going to win next turn, and I pull my knights back from active duty and start playing them out. Then my Orm of Omm was stopped at the border by their Customs House as my kingdom lied in financial ruins from my opponent's Shadow thieves as I neglected to deal with anything, single mindedly pursuing The Quest. "Sorry sir, no pay, no entry. Them's the rules." The Shadow Agent said. My kingdom fell as the Quest failed. I felt like the Trump who couldn't get his wall up. It was a great story and I still loved it even though I lost :P

But where does the wire GO? I have friends who are helping me plan out and wire my electrical system, but they can't really recommend where to put all the wires.  In a house you have plenty of extra space to run wires, but in the van any space with wires means less or no insulation.  Some questions (sorry for the WoT, and for any formatting issues):

- My break light wires were attached/hanging along the top corner of my cargo space, running from the headliner to the back of the van.  We were able to thread them through the channel there, but now that's a whole horizontal pillar that I can't stuff insulation into.  How much of a loss is this?
- Once the wires reach the back of the ceiling the connectors are too big to be shoved around the bend inside that space and now they do need to hang out.  How/where should these be bound so I can put in insulation and paneling?
- I've been told I should keep my tail light wires accessible for changing burnt out lights.  How do I do this?  Removable panels?  Wiring outside walls?
- As far as the rest of the wiring (to my outlets, lights, etc) where do I run that wiring?  From what I understand, I shouldn't just be hanging the wires between the insulation and wall panels, but should have them kind of threaded through?  How do I do this?

I’ve lost a close friend and it’s been bothering me a lot We (me:19f, him:19m) were good friends for over a year and we spoke almost everyday and always had a lot to talk about. We hung out a lot, we have the same friends and a lot of the time we’d hang out one on one too, go to gigs, go to bars, the cinema, for coffee, lunch, watch movies at his house when his parents were away etc. We told each other everything and at first we loved seeing each other and had a nice time, which is why this situation is upsetting me right now.

Despite being good friends, he has been on a downward spiral in the past year. He dropped out of college a year ago, and since he hasn’t went back to education and he hasn’t found a job. He’s grown more and more paranoid about other people and what other people think of him and what other people are doing with their lives, so much he’s jealous of guys in relationships. He started I get more bitter about ‘women’ because he believes women can easily find partners and he can’t. I noticed he’d get mood swings, random outbursts and he’d start being really cold for no reason and we’d argue, then he’d apologise the next day, and this sort of continued until he stopped apologising. We’d fall out because he would start being really mean and I’d block him/ignore him, then he’d say nothing. I always apologised for my behaviour because I realise I don’t react in the best ways when I’m emotional, I would say hurtful things back to him too and sometimes if he was in a bad mood I’d try and lighten the mood and joke around with him but sometimes he wouldn’t take it as a joke, but I always apologised for making him feel bad when I was aware I was doing so.

Things started to get sexual between us in June, I went to his house to hang out when I got back from my holiday and we got drunk, ordered Chinese and then I went to bed. He come up and got in the bed with me and we cuddled, I thought it was really sweet, then he kissed me and it was weird because we had been friends for over a year and I thought we had both made it clear to each other we were just friends and nothing more. The next day, I woke up and found him in the bed in his spare bedroom and he didn’t get up until 3 in the afternoon, but I’d left by then. I text him and asked him about it and he said he wanted to move on a forget it happened. Then, we go on a night out and we are just walking from a bar and he tells me I’ve got a nice ass, and I’m like wot, then he’s like you got nice tits too and I’m laughing and drunk and he comes onto me and we make out, then we go home and he’s all upset texting me saying he feels guilty because he doesn’t like me that way and that he was just horny, and I was like nah don’t worry about it, just a bit of fun no big deal we’re still friends, right same thing happens again except we don’t bother talking about it the second time. (Between these events we are still talking all the time as friends and hanging out, but we are probably arguing at least once a week because he always says something offensive or is rude for no reason.)


We sexted a few times after that night out (ALWAYS when we were drunk, it’s never sexual when we aren’t drunk) but it felt like we were arguing more. Emotionally and as friends we were falling apart, but getting closer sexually. We ended up having sex after a house part a few weeks ago and it was good, was kind of like make up sex because we had fallen out again for a reason I don’t even remember probably because it was petty and stupid, but after we done it he started freaking out about me telling everyone. We have had arguments in the past about who I talk to and what I tell my friends, there was one time we had fallen out and I had texted a close friend about it and expressed my feelings of the situation to her about it and how annoyed I was with him and upset, but then we worked it out and we were fine and when we were out he went on my phone and looked through my messages. Ever since he looked through those messages, he has held it against me that I talked about him and I’ve explained that he had hurt my feelings and that my way of coping with my feelings is to talk about them, but he has never understood that. He is just so paranoid about people talking about him and saying things about him he can’t trust anybody, not even me anymore.

I’ve always been completely honest with him, whenever we have fallen out I’ve always told him the truth about how I feel on what he’s saying and what I think about what he is saying, if I’ve confided in any other friend I’ve never said anything different to what he was already aware of.

I respected his wishes and I didn’t tell anyone in our group of friends we had sex, I told a few girlfriends and my sister ( it was my first time I asked their advice/experiences of the morning after pill) and I told him that I had told my sister and he freaked out and said he couldn’t be my friend or talk to me anymore because he doesn’t trust me. He called me a toxic person and said I was worse than the girl he had his first time with (she used to talk to him all the time and get upset if he didn’t reply right away and get annoyed when he wouldn’t want to hang out with her then at her house party he got wasted and threw up, passed out in her bed and she come onto him and they done it. she had a boyfriend and didn’t tell him, either, he found out because somebody else told him, she’d make fun of him afterwards and make snide comments about how he was shit in bed and had a small dick etc) which was a harsh blow because throughout our friendship, I was very aware of how much he disliked her and what he thought of her. Now I feel like he just thinks of me the same way, but he was the one who wanted to talk to me and hang out a lot at one time, he come onto me and instigated most of the sexual things we done.

I just feel really angry he has cut me out because he is paranoid I’ll ‘talk about him’ despite what we done also being my business just as much as it is his, also I’ve explained that I don’t talk about him behind his back slyly, whenever I have spoken about him it has been when he has been an a**hole and spoke to me like garbage, and it’s only ever been to my close friends who I trust not to gossip or cause sh*t for me. I’m just really sad about the whole situation and I’ve been trying to carry on with my life, see my other friends and family, go out on dates and just try to forget about it rather than asking him why he can’t trust me that much he hates me and doesn’t want to be my friend or speak to me anymore.

Me an younger brother get the other bro a PC - he flips me off and plays a CB Been reading this sub for a while so I though "fck, why not post some spice of mine, eh?"... ...so here we go...

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

We are 3 brothers;

\- me, the oldest, very into programming and computer stuffs

\- 2 years younger, the CB, sort of artist and a douche from time to time

\- 4 yours younger, the generous, also a bit into programming (will call him "the younger")

&amp;#x200B;

So CB is pretty abusive with his devices. He loses it pretty fast and is not really "controllable" when he's "on his period" or playing a douche. He had a laptop, not to mention that he got it for free, which was not really meant for gaming or anything (integrated graphics...) but yet he expected that it would run [WOT](https://worldoftanks.com) smoothly, which it did not so he was constantly hitting on the table and if you ask me also on the laptop which at some point died, first the HDD (but got a new SSD for free installed), then the screen (which he said cracked when the laptop fell - I doubt) so he used an external monitor. One night there was a pretty large storm outside, ofc lightnings all over the sky, yet he decided to go play games, so the motherboard got burned that time. He was without his laptop for a while, until the younger bro decided to upgrade his PC. He was saving money for a while, made a list of components, made sure everything was compatible, etc. (that beast of a PC turned out fucking awesome &lt;3) and decided to give his old, still \~400$ PC to the CB. At first he said he will give it to me, but that was before the CB got his laptop burned.


So &gt;skip&gt; to the day that he got all the parts and we assembled the thing and got it working, but little did I know, it did not have an integrated GPU, because it was an AMD system. The younger bro kept his GPU because it was (and still is) pretty powerful GPU, so we were left without a display adapter. Well shit, I guess imma try to get one for free... And lets not forget that the CB was already complaining why he has to wait so long.
Next day in school I go to IT and ask for a spare GPU, you know the old nvidias from the age when stickers on fans were a cool thing... Enough to use MS Paint FFS... Jokes apart it runs well and WOT works with &gt;30 FPS on low, so for free stuff... should not complain, right? Well ofc WRONG, if not I would not be here...


&lt;back in time&lt; CB proceeded flipping me off over the phone when I told him that it would be fair to give the younger bro some money since he's giving him \~400$ worth PC, all of that while setting it up with his old SSD, etc. He did not give the money. CB was also complaining about how the GPU is "cheap as fuck" and why am I even bringing him this garbage.


For the ones that actually read the whole thing - a little spicy hidden revenge;

As said above, CB never gave the money to mah younger brother. Luckily my very good friend was about to upgrade his CPU. So I swapped the CPU from the old PC with his, he gave me his CPU + 80$ for younger bro and I installed the weaker  (friends CPU) in that system. I know, 80$ is not much compared to 400$, but still. The dolla is a dolla (except is Euro, but whatever)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR
We are 3 brothers; me, CB, youngest. CB gets his \*already free\* laptop dead, youngest buys new beast of a PC - gives old one to CB, old PC does not have GPU - I get one for free, CB refuses to give 80$ to youngest - the old PC is \~400$, I swap CPUs with good friend + get 80$ for youngest

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you enjoyed this little bit of my story that I shared. Have a happy new year :)

How Is Perception Active? Obsessive Oversearching Party So, I have a VERY observant party. Our Cleric is passive Wisdom (Perception) 20, and the Druid is 23; both are Wis-dominant classes, and both took Observant. I'm fine with this, except then they still want to roll active Perception dice, to make sure they aren't missing a god stalking them, or something. Outside of combat, "a round" seems inconsequential, and there seems little to stop the party from just rolling a d20 every few seconds, each player, because one cascades into several, to see what's what. It doesn't seem to "slow them down", and they are rarely on a real time crunch. If they roll bad, they still get to go with their best Passive, so it's just a farce opportunity to roll EVEN better, knowing their passive has them, even if not; five separate chances to see if that one key detail was missed. I planned to have a sneaky dragon hide in the snow, and ambush them, but even if the passive 23 wasn't too much for him to beat (this is why I asked, in another question, about concealment and bonuses to Stealth checks), they'll see him if they roll, and they'll see him if they roll BADLY. How do you make Active Perception, outside of combat, feel like something you choose to do, or something you might not choose to do? Even if it was just the druid, trying to roll better than 10, to beat her passive 23, but the whole party does it, and they really don't have a reason not to. It's free, out of combat.

I don't want to disincentivize them, but it seems wrong in system to just constantly roll Perception, as you walk, all five of you (even if the worst CAN'T roll better than the best (it would be close, anyway). I don't want to say "no, you can't roll to notice things; I'm trying to be stealthy over here!" I'm not, likely, and it would take a Gray Man from WoT, or a Scarred Lands Treacherous Thief, to be able to stealth past the druid and cleric, but I don't want them to just roll every other step. Every step isn't an Acrobatics check, and failure has consequences, so how do I bring Perception into line with the other skills? Or do I just accept it's a game, and people like to roll dice? With PP 23, I'm telling them everything that sees, whether they rolled, rolled poorly, or didn't even care, so how do you handle this? Why NOT constantly try to beat your average? What's the cost of "obsessively searching"?

Other skills have times you use them, and the rest, you don't,but Perception is "anytime, I want to KNOW if anything's around me", and it doesn't seem to slow you down; what's six seconds as you walk in the trees? If that was when the trap was sprung, maybe that could be ruled your "Action" that first round, but I can't say there's precedent for that. I guess I just want to know how to let my players use their absurd passive Perception options, and not constantly roll, constantly all of them, because there really doesn't seem like any reason not to, and to have actively looking around feel different than passively picking up on things. Sorry if this went weird, or is hard to follow.

Sweet KARMA story time! WOT incoming be careful. TLDR at the end for the lazy.

The story began when i took a didi back to my home from shopping centre together with my family. Arrived at the main gate of my apartment complex in a rush (2 kids + wife + ipad + nintendo switch and other many things) i get out of the car and proceed to gather all my kids and things and then walk towards home. After around a minute a realize that my phone was missing and i proceed to call my number that is "magically" powered off (remember only maybe a couple of minutes passed since i got out of the car). Since i was 100% i had the phone in the car (because you need to confirm didi trip and check car license plate) the only 2 options were that i left in the car or dropped somewhere between the car and the main gate (approx. 5m distance) as once inside the garden it's impossible to get stolen as we have camera everywhere and this is a high income garden.

I immediately call the didi driver asking him to check inside the car and he just in 1 second mention he can't find anything and cut my phone. The fact the phone is now powered off is also a sign that something bad happened indeed. This seemed extremely suspicious. So while we call didi service to push this guy to check once again we go back downstairs to check around the area and the main street without finding anything (also asking the baoan).

My rage become immense as i'm now almost 100% sure the didi driver got my phone and basically i'm fucked up since there is no way to prove it.

Well the luck comes to my help as i ask the garden management to check the front gate camera tape....and TADA!!! Basically what happened is that i had dropped the phone just outside the driver's passenger door while i was getting out. The piece of shit driver notices it and waits for a while, then he proceeds to ask a bystander to pick up the phone for him and then runs away with us.

We then rush to the police with evidence and even they try to call him he just switches off his phone. We start to really get pissed off also when the police basically mention us that is not a crime to pick up a phone and keep as he's not technically stealing it (like what the fuck? For real?). The only thing we could do is to bring him to court as police can't handle directly.

Finally this guy re-emerges and contact my wife telling her he will send her the phone back the next day.

Today the phone is in our hands once again safe and sound. Funny how his excuses was that he found it on the street and means he was not aware that the owners actually wanted their phone back.

**Update**: Looks like didi service fired the guy as in he cannot be a didi driver anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR : Got a didi ride back home, lost the phone just outside the passenger door while getting out, driver saw it and takes it. When we call him he denies. Video from cctv busts him and after we go to police he decide that he indeed has it and send us back.**

Computer gives no display, fans suddenly loud and last sound fragment loops I thought this was a driver issue but after reinstalling some drivers and updating old ones, it happened again. All I did was play a mildy intensive game (WoT) for not even an hour then all the sudden the display to the monitor cuts off, PC freezes, fans suddenly run super loud and the last sound fragment of the game plays on loop through the speakers. The only way to fix the problem is to hard reboot the PC.

Second time this has happened and In pretty sure it's not a driver issue. GPU never exceeds 80 degrees Celsius, the highest I've ever seen the CPU was 71 degrees Celsius. However, the computer does run relatively hot under load.

Prebuilt HP 410-009 (Windows 10, i3-4170, 1 stick of DDR3 8gb @ 1333mhz, I added a GT 1030 some time ago.

I'm not really a genius on computers, but it could have something to do with the Mobo as I've read the board sensors to get all the way up to 50 degrees, and considering that this is a stock OEM motherboard that's way out of proportion with the bigger components...

Suddenly cut display, PC unresponsive, fans go full blast and last sound fragment plays on loop I thought this was a driver issue but after reinstalling some drivers and updating old ones, it happened again. All I did was play a mildy intensive game (WoT) for not even an hour then all the sudden the display to the monitor cuts off, PC freezes (keyboard inputs stop working) fans suddenly run super loud and a piece of the last sound of the game plays on loop through the speakers. The only way to fix the problem is to hard reboot the PC.

87 Supra rebuilt engine road test issues and questions 7mgte straight 6 3.0l I am a tad worried and nervous to take her out on the road for the first time and seat these rings.  I am very explanatory so this may look wordy, but I am trying to give you as much detail as possible.  My main concerns are that it when I fired it up in August, she fired up and warmed up in the driveway, no overheating issues or major leaks, so I was very happy about that.  However, it was reading pretty damn lean on my AFR gauge, which had me worried.  I smoke-tested the motor beforehand and I saw not a damn puff of smoke.  Felt great about that.  Vacuum at idle was a little lower than I wanted, sitting about 14-15 inches.  I know that number should rise a little once the rings are seated so I can at least drive it with those numbers and not worry about leak issues.  I am using the SAFC2 to tune it and I have the Lexus AFM/Walbro fuel pump combo with the RC 550s, that were freshly cleaned and passed inspection.  When I first built the car, I had vacuum/boost leaks that I wasn't aware of and was using the JT61GT turbo.  For this build, I have a brand new slightly smaller, faster spooling turbo from Boost Lab.  My SAFC2 was used to manipulate the vacuum leak I wasn't aware of, so I was adding fuel to bring the AFR numbers down.  As I was fixing the leaks, I started dialing down the fuel addition and the car was running great before the headgasket gave up on maintaining coolant pressure.  So now, the SAFC2 numbers are for the old build, and I want to just add fuel to get it to a proper AFR.  The final WOT tune would be done on a dyno like last time, but for this initial test run, I don't need this thing leaning out on me.  Fuel pressure is right on the money as well, vacuum line on and off, so I am hoping adding a little fuel to get my numbers proper is alright to do.


For taking the time to read all this, here is a couple pictures of Luna and her core...

￼

￼


Now, my major concern that is also related is what's driving me crazy the most.  I read a lot about the process of breaking in the motor, with running it hard and changing the oil numerous times and all that.  And what scares me is that the engine started smoking after letting it run in the driveway too long.  To be honest, she only ran for like 10-15 minutes tops to make sure nothing was leaking and make my inspections.  After reading about the issue of letting the car run too long and ruining the process of ring seating, I am starting to worry that I have ruined my motor by fucking up the break-in process.  I really didn't let it run all that long when I think about it, and she has not been started since August.  So my plan tomorrow is to start the car, let it warm up, quickly add some fuel with the SAFC2 to not have it run so lean, and then take it out on the road to hopefully seat what is left of the rings and hope that the smoking stops or at least dramatically decreases.  Can someone give me some more insight as to what damage I have possibly done, or any other advice you can think of for an initial break-in?  Thank you for taking the time to read this!  Happy NEW YEAR!  I'm trying to start mine up on a better note with getting this car on the road for the first time in 6 years.

Knock So I brought my Speed3 in to Mazda because my drive belt rotted and there was leaking coming from underneath my timing cover. My car is fully bolted and tuned to 313 horse, and now after they’ve done the job I’m getting crazy high knock readings during WOT. I was getting consistent 6.0 readings yesterday. You guys know what the issue is? Does my tuner have to reset my timing?

2013 Mazdaspeed 3 Fuel Pressure Right now in my 2013 Mazdaspeed 3, I'm running a Corksport induction system (same MAF size as stock) and a cobb stage 1+ tune. I wanted to check my HPFP's psi through peak boost, and I read on cobbs webpage to do a 2k-6k rpm WOT 3rd gear pull. I did multiple logs and my psi stayed above 1600. I recently logged a WOT 2k-6k rpm 2nd gear pull and saw my fuel pressure dropped to 1450 psi (I then went back and did a 3rd gear log and everything seemed peachy). Should this 2nd gear pull be a cause for concern or is it normal because it's a lower gear?

Prius door light won’t go off My friend has an 08 Prius that wot recognize that the door is closed, so the dome light won’t go off. I assume it’s the sensor that’s bad, since she says that the door latches fine. My main questions are:
1. Since it’s a hybrid, is it ok to leave it until she can get someone to fix it? Or is the constant drain worse on hybrid batteries?
2. Am I right in assuming that it’s the sensor?
3. Any other general tips?

The year is 1850 in a river in California... Hundreds of miners arrive in the river and all the territory in the river is claimed within 5 minutes as they look for treasure. Most of the miners grab a space in the river, but some got there a little too late, and didn't get any space, so they left... except one. For a few days, one miner sat in his wagon and watched the other miners dig.

One miner in the river finds no gold in his space, so after a week, he packs up and leaves and puts a sign saying, "No gold here"

Despite the warning, the miner who sat watching the other miners dig quickly snagged the empty area and tore the sign out.

The miner who left that space said, "Wot you doin' dere boy? Didn't ya see da sign? Dere ain't no gold there."

The other miner put the sign back in the ground and said, "Dere is now."

The first miner scratches his head. "Watcha mean?"

"I taked the sign out and put it back in." The other miner says. You always get gold for repostin'."

Game Of Trolls My body. OPK test. My temps. FF. I don’t even know who’s trolling me harder.

I’ve posted quite a bit about this messy cycle of mine, in which I traveled to and from a time zone 7 hours away with my FT towards the end of that time. Should I have let this cycle be? Probably. Did I? Of course not.

This is my first cycle temping and peeing in little cups (or tea cups, if I had to. Sorry mom, I washed them in boiling water) and sticking these cute little ovulation sticks in, and watching my pee dry with a patience I didn’t know I possessed.

ANYWAY. I thought I had this nice little positive:
https://i.imgur.com/KpkY2js.jpg
Only for r/TFABLinePorn to crush my dreams in the nicest way possible. However, tests after that were only more negative (with an occasional squinter)

So here I started doubting myself. Did I just jot ovulate this cycle? Was it still to come? My CM was no help whatsoever, and a delayed ovulation wouldn’t be out of the question because of the travel and an additional little stress and drama caused by apparently reacting back to Prozac (sorry brain, I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU). Then my temps decided to throw a party and consistently go up. Okay then. Did I ovulate after all?
See my hyperactive chart here: https://i.imgur.com/GHZ8DxD.jpg

I decided to retroactively declare that sad ass ovulation test positive (I like to disappoint myself) and go my merry way, thinking thewinebaby into existence (ok maybe I need to think about that name again).

Meanwhile mr winefairy (winewizard? Wineelf? Idfk) our of nowhere drops yesterday “so I guess that one didn’t take, eh?” (Didn’t WOT now, mate? its CD 22, borrow my Taking Charge Of Your Fertility book) and I, masochist and lover of wasting resources keep taking these dumb ovulation test (jk I already mentioned I love them, sorry tests, please dont fail me) - only to get another half ass not quite positive today. https://i.imgur.com/VlXrGy6.jpg

my CM is barely there, my titty is sensitive (though she is often, both a result of breast reduction and growing cysts like its my job). my skin is bad. WHAT DO I MAKE OF THIS?! not asking whether I am pregnant just rather what the heckity heck is going on and do I need to throw down mr winefairy for some fiery BD’ing tonight or just give up and drink wine ans obsessively watch murder documentaries till AF comes?

if you made it through this novel woah, thanks. I think you are beautiful and you deserve the best 2019, whatever that may look like for you. dont forget to exhale and drink some water. you are loved.

I've been finding it really hard to connect with music for the last few months, help? or, I dare say, years, but that sounds way too dramatic.

The last time I was truly captivated by an album was 2-3 years ago. I listened to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and I was blown away by it. I enjoyed it so much that I played the record again after it had ended. Even though it might not seem such a big deal to some of you, since then no album made me feel that way again.

y'know

that feeling when you're so captivated by a record you just forget about yourself, about your issues and your life, and idk you're breath synchronizes with the track's rhythm and you get shivers and it ***just feels so amazing and beautiful and fucking good man***

I haven't experienced that in a long time. Actually, I sort of did, but it only lasted for a couple of songs, after which I lost my interest for the music.

For example, yesterday, I decided to give Morbid Angel a try. The first track of Altars of Madness was hypnotizing. Yet by the album's third track I was bored.

And (roughly) the same goes for Iron Maiden, Eluvietie, Death (Symbolic got me pretty hooked though, almost finished the album), Dissection, Metallica, Nightwish, Emperor, Burzum (actually Filosofem pretty much offered me the same 'climax' Sgt. Pepper gave me but it had that 26 minute long synth song which turned me off.)

Any advice? My headphones are fine (audio-tehnica ath m40x), I usually download FLAC tracks, and my laptop does a good job at delivering the sound. I might also have depression, but since I'm 17 my parents won't take me seriosly ('it's just a phase' 'this is how teenagers are') so the only therapist I could get is music. But music doesn't get me anymore.

wot do I do halp

Is this a timing issue? Earlier this week I started hearing this weird chirping noise from my car. I didn't think much of it, just brushed it off as the header heat shield rattling or the serpentine belt being loose. This morning I poked around a bit and tightened the serpentine belt and it felt like the sound went away so i went on with my day and off to work.

When I left work my car cranked a little bit longer than usual but I decided it was just because the engine must've been heat soaked from me idling it a bit before. After i left work I noticed the car was definitely very slow on its acceleration. Imagine accelerating in 5th gear from 3mph up to 70mph, that's about how fast it went. I was already headed to autozone to pick up a new headlight bulb and exhaust flange gasket due to an exhaust leak and thought maybe the lack of back pressure was really taking its toll on the car. After I left AutoZone the car cranked even longer than before and had literally no power, at WOT in first gear it would've taken me all of 60 seconds to hit 30mph.

Here's how fast it accelerated in 3rd gear at WOT:
https://youtu.be/ERxrv3O1UBs

I limped the car home and on the way when I was decelerating it sounded like a machine gun, tons and tons of pops and bangs from the exhaust. I talked to my step dad about the issue andI went ahead and fixed the exhaust and also checked my oil to find it was down a full quart (I know I'm due for an oil change but I didn't realize it was low like that). I added oil and fixed the exhaust and tried to start the car and this is what happened:

https://youtu.be/GbuwCCLba44

The throttle response was super laggy and the engine revs up at a speed that is about a quarter to half of what it should be.

Step dad said he thought he heard noise from the valves when we revved the engine (not lifter tick).

I immediately thought timing belt, must be a few teeth off or worse. Probably explains the sound I heard earlier in the week too, I imagine the belt is rubbing up against the engine.

What do you think my issue is? I already ordered a full timing belt kit and water pump.

Car is a 1999 NB 5-speed with 184,000 miles.

Selling my 20th anniversary GTI This is an extremely rare model made by Volkswagen, #3256 out of only 4,000 in the U.S. and 200 in Canada.

Car was tuned and dynoed by SSP Tuning, making 350WHP on 19PSI and 400WHP on 22PSI. This wasn't a car built to mess around in like the kids with 2-step/WOT boxes. None of that garbage, just pure power. I will try to describe the car as best as possible,

14' Focus ST misfire under WOT So let me start out by saying that I absolutely love this car... But I have sunken so much money into repairs, I bought my car used with 59k on it. So the first thing that goes wrong was the synchros for 3rd-4th, So Carmax repairs those and gives me a new clutch and fly wheel on account of them being "unusually worn". Now, we get into after my limited warranty was up. First For the longest time I was having wierd power/ acceleration issues, not bombing it down the highway too often meant that I really didnt notice it, Turns out I had a transmission leak of sorts and that ended up being covered by the same people that opened the trans to do the synchros. So just after I thought all my mechanical issues with my less than 6 month old "new" used car were done, I Bought an intake for it. I went kinda cheap on the intake thinking I would buy a more premium one in the future, I got an AF Dynamic intake, its just an ebay part pretty much. Well i ended up liking the sound of it and Ive kept it on till this day. Just after I put the intake on, in the midst of summer in Boston, My heat/ac system shit the bed, it would shake the dash violently when turned up in speed and would smell like burnt old food, A local mechanic told me I needed a AC compressor, and Evaporator to fix the issue, That was a 600 dollar fix. With the compressor and evaporator in, the dash was still shaking slightly under use, but no more stink so for now I dealt with only using the first two power settings on the ac. It was nearing Autumn so I forgot about that issue until about now but we'll get to that. So after getting the ac semi repaired I ordered a Cobb Catback exhaust, turbo smart BOV, and Cobb rear motor mount. I was so excited to put my Cobb exhaust on, about a week later I got a text from a buddy telling me he could help me take the old one off and replace it no prob, along with do the motor mount and BOV. So i bomb it 40 minutes up the highway with the cobb exhaust in pieces in the trunk, we get to doing the install, and we notice that the previous owner of the car not only had taken the stock exhaust off before, he decided to weld it back on to the stock downpipe when he sold it. So I was upset to say the least, I had bought a downpipe on the spot out of rage, I got the CJ's Pony parts in house made 3 inch catted downpipe, It was 300 cheaper than the cobb so I said fuck it whos gonna see it. Anyways, we ended up putting on the motor mount, and attempting to put on the bov but the people that been taking off my wheels have been swelling my lugnuts up and we couldn't get a nut off without breaking a stud, So we just didnt do the BOV and its still sitting in my trunk to this day. so after receiving my downpipe a week or so later, I go back up the highway to my buddies house, we cut the stock catback off (fuck ford making you cut shit) and removed the old downpipe, my friend who is a Nissan technician had a hard time getting all 3 o2 sensors off, he only managed to get 2 of 3. Again, I had to roll with it, we put the new 3 inch downpipe on there with 2 sensors in, put the catback on, and my friend filled the gap in the sensor hole with a putty that turns to rock under heat (BAD IDEA!!!!!!!). I start the car and it was music to my ears, all though shes gargling and popping cause she doesnt know how much gas to give herself, it sounds mean as hell really a deep throaty rawr. So I head home and a few days later my friend told me that he just couldnt get the old sensor off and Id have to buy a new one. So thats what I did. I got a Boch o2 sensor for like 70 bucks, turns out I got the wrong bank and the one i had to buy was $180. So I make the exchange with autozone, and go to get the sensor installed, that putty that was hard as a rock got stuck in the threads and created a much more expensive issue. so my local mechanic gets the sensor on and tells me that after a bit of driving I should be fine. my car started to have more strange power loss issues (kinda like the ones im experiencing now) under load, I was convinced it was a turbo leak and after 3 mechanics and a month later it was fixed for 9 dollars in materials. so at this point, other than my AC/Heat my car seems to be perfect.... Wrong, the power loss issue was lessened by the turbo leak fix, but I still have a loss of power under high rpm/ WOT. Now were approaching the present time, my car has a rejection sticker for emissions, and I made an appointment to get the emissions issue fixed and finally get my air system fixed, aswell as get my breaks done and an oil change. The job was $1400.. 2 replacement O2 sensors, and a new blower motor that took 4 hours to get to the old one alone. After this most recent job I was convinced that my car was gonna be right for the first time.. Nope, I took the car to get inspected and it didnt pass, so after two new sensors and a shit load of driving to to complete the drive cycle, it still is having power loss issues under high rpm loads. I was still using my car for errands until 4 days ago when my check engine light came on, Ive now been waiting till tomorrows appointment to take the car out. So with this story, does anyone have any idea to why im having this power loss? The air fuel ratio is defiantly off because the car sounds rich. I saw a possible answer that stated that I should have bought an access port also to tune the car right after the exhaust and intake. I dont wanna spend $500 just yet as I am in between jobs. any help would be greatly appreciated!!

P0125 98 Corolla So I posted a couple days ago about a Corolla with 200k that suddenly overnight wouldn't crank over. Was running normal until it parked. Checked things over, everything seemed fine. Would just crank mercilessly and almost attempt to fire  up but would never fire up. To advice of someone here I cranked it while holding the throttle all the way open.

Here is what went on after. After some more cranking I WAS able to get the car started by using WOT. I let the car warm up on the driveway. No CEL was present. I decided to take it for a spin. Not long into the drive the cars CEL came on. P0125. I drove to a nearby parking lot and cleared the code. Took it for another test drive, popped up again within 10 mins.

Meanwhile ive had the car hooked up to a Bluetooth scanner the whole time. Before the CEL came on I was getting an outrageous reading on 02 sensor. Something like 11-19000F, I can't remember exactly but it seemed absurd. It had this reading from the start while it warming up and I was fiddling with my scanner. Read onlin, the code about p0125 seems to point to coolant temp sensor, coolant or thermostat creating an open loop.

All along the drive I was monitoring the coolant temp. It never passed halfway on my dash, it didn't go past 190-210F on my scanner. This seems to suggest that my ECT sensor is operating correctly? The thermostat didn't seem like it was stuck open as the car warmed up fine in the driveway. Let the car cool down and the coolant was full. The code p0125 doesnt seem to mention anything about an 02 sensor but doing some quick searches I've seen people mention changing the 02 sensor for this CEL code.  What do you guys think?

Heirlooms I’ve been pondering the word ‘heirloom’.  It’s not a word that gets used a lot (once in NotW, six times in WMF). But it is ALWAYS associated with an item integral to the story.  The one occurrence from NotW:

&gt; “Well that's the greet damn secret, hain't it?” Schiem said bitterly, taking another drink. “From wot I hear, he was out there, diggen the house foundation, an' pullen up stones. **Then he finds a little stone room all sealed up toight. But he makes everybody keep mum about what he finds there** on account he wants et tae be this greet surprise at the wedding.”
&gt;
&gt; “Some sort o' treasure?” I asked.
&gt;
&gt; “Nae money.” He shook his head. “Mauthen's never been quiet aboot that. Et were probably some sort o'…” his mouth opened and closed a bit, searching for a word, “… **what de ye call something old that rich folk put on a shelf tae impress all their grummer friends?**”
&gt;
&gt;  I gave a helpless shrug.
&gt;
&gt;“**An heirloom?**” Denna said.
&gt;
&gt; Schiem laid his finger alongside his nose and then pointed to her, smiling. “That's et. Some flash thing tae impress folk. He's a showy bastard, Mauthen is.” (NotW ch.73)

&amp;nbsp;

Only…that’s not exactly what an heirloom is.  Neither in the original nor in the current sense.
[Heir + loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom)
&gt; In popular usage, an heirloom is something, perhaps an antique or some kind of jewelry, that has been passed down for generations through family members.
&gt;
&gt; The term originated with the historical principle of an heirloom in English law, a chattel which by immemorial usage was **regarded as annexed by inheritance to a family estate. Loom originally meant a tool.** Such genuine heirlooms were almost unknown by the beginning of the twentieth century.

&amp;nbsp;

The three references from WMF:

---

&gt; “From what I understand, **the Lackless family has an heirloom. Well, not an heirloom exactly, but an ancient thing that dates back to the beginning of their line.**”
&gt;
&gt; “There’s not much odd with that. **Old families are rife with heirlooms**.”
&gt;
&gt; …
&gt;
&gt; “What was this **heirloom**?”
&gt;
&gt; Caudicus rinsed his hands in a porcelain bowl and shook them dry. “I’ve heard that **on the oldest parts of the Lackless lands, in the oldest part of their ancestral estate, there is a secret door. A door without a handle or hinges.**” He watched me to make sure I was paying attention. “There’s no way of opening it. It is locked, but at the same time, lockless. No one knows what’s on the other side.”  (WMF ch.59)

---

&gt; “It’s an **heirloom**,” I said easily. “Very old—”
&gt;
&gt; “How old would you think?” Alveron interjected hungrily.
&gt;
&gt; “Perhaps three thousand years,” I said. “Give or take.” Meluan stiffened in surprise. “I am close to your own guesses I take it?”   (WMF ch.139)

---

&gt; Denna stopped walking in front of a pawnshop window, her face a mask of distress. “I thought I could trust him!” she said. “But he just pawned it and ran off with the money! There’s the ring right there!” She pointed dramatically at the shop’s window.
&gt;
&gt; “But,” Denna continued, holding up a finger. “Luckily, he sold the ring for a fraction of what it’s worth. It’s **a family heirloom** worth forty talents, but the pawnshop is selling it for four.”
&gt;
&gt; Denna stepped close and lay her hand on my chest, looking up at me with wide, imploring eyes. “If you bought the ring, we could sell it for at least twenty. I’d give you your four talents back right away.” (WMF ch.19)

---

The three things associated with *heir + loom* in WMF:  a door, a box, a ring.
You can probably see where I’m going with this…
a door (without a handle / holds the flood)
a box (no lid or locks)
a ring (unworn / not for wearing)
heir (son who brings the blood)


Is there any way a three foot high painted pot with Chandrian imagery could be a fairly heirloom that fits somewhere in the riddle/rhyme?

Oh boio, I signed up for a furry website called FurryMates, I think, as a joke. And there was t h i s guy Pretty much I have a crappy phone rn and it wasn't talking screenshots so here I guess

99' Miata Severe Throttle Lag As a follow up to my post yesterday, I had originally thought my cars timing was off but after a quick check of the timing belt I was able to determine it is spot on and the belt is in great shape.

I still have my throttle lag issue though and the car is undriveable.

Codes:

P0106 - MAP Solenoid issue

I had never seen this code before until today, has to deal with the MAP solenoid next to the boost sensor. There's a broken hose leading to this sensor and after resetting the ECU and doing a quick repair job on the hose the issue with the throttle lag was NOT fixed.

P0171 - Bank 1 too lean

I've had this code basically since I've bought the car, can't get it to go away no matter what I do (list of repairs already made below).

P0140 and P0141 - Bank 2 Oxygen Sensor faults

I'm de-catted so I don't run a rear O2 sensor. Has never had an effect on performance.

List of repairs I've already made while trying to solve P0171 code:

Replaced:
• EVAP Solenoid
• Plugs (twice)
•Wires (Three times, always NGK Blues)
• Coil pack (Currently an eBay pack, installed a couple months ago, maybe worth putting the OEM one back in to test it)
• Fuel Filter
• Both O2 sensors (did front one twice, currently has an OEM sensor)
• Cleaned MAF multiple times and verified it works
• Checked IAT sensor and verified it works

Car has a cold (hot) air intake and it pulled the P0171 even on the OEM intake system.

Previous owner claimed to have just changed the gas cap also and done timing belt.

Here is what happens when I give it some throttle:
https://youtu.be/U1wqdZV_Adc

Horrible throttle lag and revs at about half the speed it should. Barely has enough power to get itself rolling on its own.

Here is WOT in 3rd gear:
https://youtu.be/ERxrv3O1UBs

Here is me attempting to start it when I first noticed the issue:
https://youtu.be/GbuwCCLba44

Some people have suggested it may be fuel related, dad suggests changing coil pack. Currently it isn't misfiring, exhaust is popping pretty crazily though.

Don't have a fuel pressure gauge but I can get one if need be.

Appreciate all the help I can get, thanks.

Thrown rod? What happened? Just picked up my roommates bike from shop for having the crankcase sealed up after our bad attempt at doing so anyway. Rolling threw the gears at highway speed on the way home there was a loud bang or pop and the bike lost power. Came to a stop, and now won’t stay running, turns over but sounds like it’s struggling. Dies out eventually. My roommate was behind me, no smoke car out, this happened at like 80mph at WOT in 6th gear. 2005 yamaha vstar 650.

The Four Magics of Nina **“You'd be surprised at the sorts of things hidden away in children's songs.”**

That quote and the recent discussion on colors got me thinking about the Mauthen pot and Nina.  From Lackless rhymes, to Chandrian rhymes, children in the story are vehicles for revelation.

## There is Dream Magic

NotW (ch.82)
&gt; I shook my head reassuringly, but she burst into tears anyway. “I been so scared since what happened out at Mauthen’s,” she sobbed. “**I keep having dreams. I know they’re going to come get me.**”

---
WMF (ch.35)
&gt; Nina took a step closer. “**I had dreams after you left**,” she said, her voice low and confidential. “**Bad dreams. I thought they were coming for me because of what I told you**.” She gave me a meaningful look. “But then I started sleeping with the amulet you gave me. **I made my prayers every night, and the dreams went away**.” One of her hands absentmindedly fingered a piece of bright metal that hung around her neck on a leather cord.

---
&gt; She nodded. “As soon as I had it under my pillow and said my prayers, I slept like a babe at the tit. **Then I started having my special dream**,” she said, and smiled up at me. “**I dreamed about the big pot Jimmy showed me** before those folks were kilt up at the Mauthen farm.

---
&gt; Nina continued to chatter away, unaware of my disappointment. “**I dreamed about the pot for three nights in a row,” she said. “And it weren’t a bad dream at all. I woke up all rested and happy every night. I knew then what God was telling me to do.

---
&gt; “So you dreamed of a different side each night?” I asked.
&gt;
&gt; She shook her head. “Just this side. Three nights in a row.”

---
&gt; “If this is one side,” I asked, “Do you remember the rest of it?”
&gt;
&gt; “Not like this. **I remember there was a woman with no clothes on, and a broken sword, and a fire. . . .”** She looked thoughtful, then shook her head again. “Like I told you, I only saw it for a quick second when Jimmy showed me. **I think an angel helped me remember this piece in a dream so I could paint it down and bring it to you.**”

---
&gt; Nina nodded easily. “**It seemed the best thing, since an angel gave me the dream.**

---

&amp;nbsp;

Does this mirror anything with Denna?
&gt; “I don't tend to sleep through the night anyway,” Denna said. “So that shouldn't be a problem.”
&gt;
&gt; “**You have trouble sleeping**?”
&gt;
&gt; “**I have dreams**,” she said in a tone of voice that made it clear that was all she had to say on the subject.   (NotW ch.74)

---
Obligatory Tehlu:
&gt; So late one night, **Tehlu went to her in a dream**. He stood before her, and seemed to be made entirely of fire or sunlight. He came to her in splendor and asked her if she knew who he was. .   (NotW ch.23)

---
Elodin says the sleeping mind *remembers everything*.  Is Nina’s sleeping mind dreaming of seeing things her waking mind does not remember?
&gt; The answer is that each of us has two minds: a waking mind and a sleeping mind. Our waking mind is what thinks and talks and reasons. **But the sleeping mind is more powerful. It sees deeply to the heart of things. It is the part of us that dreams. It remembers everything.** (NotW ch.86)

---

&amp;nbsp;

## We know there is going to be a Written Magic

&gt; “It was a big fancy pot,” she said softly. “About this high.” She held her hand about three feet off the ground. It was shaking. “**It had all sorts of writings and pictures on it. Really fancy.** I haven’t ever seen colors like that. And some of the paints were shiny like silver and gold.”

---
&gt; Can you remember anything else?” I asked. She shook her head. “**What about the writing**?”
&gt;
&gt; Nina shook her head. “**This was all foreign writing. It didn’t say anything.**”

---

&amp;nbsp;

*Foreign writing* could by sygaldry ruins, or merely an archaic language that Nina isn’t familiar with.  Sygaldry comes up both times Denna is asking about written magic. Denna doesn’t start asking about it until *after* the Mauthen farm incident.

&gt; “Making something like that is called artificing,” I said. “**Sygaldry is writing or carving the runes** that make it work.”
&gt;
&gt; **Denna’s eyes lit up at this. “So it’s a magic where you write things down?”** she asked, leaning forward in her chair. “How does it work?”  (WMF ch.11)

---

&gt; Denna looked us over again, her eyes serious. **“Is there a type of magic that’s just . . .” She wiggled her fingers vaguely. “Just sort of writing things down?”  **
&gt;
&gt; “There’s sygaldry,” I said. “Like that bell in your room. It’s like permanent sympathy.”
&gt;
&gt; “But it’s still moneychanging, right?” she asked. “Just energy?”
&gt;
&gt; I nodded.
&gt;
&gt; Denna looked embarrassed as she asked, “What if someone told you they knew a type of magic that did more than that? **A magic where you sort of wrote things down, and whatever you wrote became true?**”
&gt;
&gt; She looked down nervously, her fingers tracing patterns on the tabletop. “Then, **if someone saw the writing, even if they couldn’t read it, it would be true for them. They’d think a certain thing, or act a certain way depending on what the writing said.**” She looked up at us again, her expression a strange mix of curiosity, hope, and uncertainty.   (WMF ch.18)

## Nina believes in Magic Music

Nina’s painting of Cinder/Haliax/the Ciridae sets Kvothe on the path of searching out more information on the Amyr.  It shifts his focus from the Seven to the Amyr.

&gt; I carefully rerolled the piece of paper and tucked it back into the hollow piece of horn. My mind spun with what I had just learned. I thought of what I’d heard Haliax say to Cinder all those years ago: *Who keeps you safe from **the Amyr**, the Singers, the Sithe*?
&gt;
&gt; After my months of searching, I was fairly certain the Archives held nothing more than faerie stories about the Chandrian. Nobody considered them more real than shamble-men or faeries.
&gt;
&gt; But everyone knew about the Amyr. They were the bright knights of the Aturan Empire. They were the strong hand of the church for two hundred years. They were the subject of a hundred stories and songs.
&gt;
&gt; I knew my history. The Amyr had been founded by the Tehlin Church in the early days of the Aturan Empire.
&gt;
&gt; But the pottery Nina had seen had been much older than that.
&gt;
&gt; I knew my history. The Amyr had been condemned and disbanded by the church before the empire fell.
&gt;
&gt; But I knew the Chandrian were still afraid of them today.
&gt;
&gt; **It seemed like there was more to the story.**    (WMF ch.35)

---
&gt; I closed my eyes and a **story with Amyr** in it bubbled to the surface. Hardly surprising. **They had been on my mind constantly since Nina had found me**.   (WMF ch.36)

---

&amp;nbsp;

Kvothe sets himself on the path of the Amyr, but he misses an important connection.  A connection to the Singers.  Nina believes in *magic music*. This immediately precedes it:

&gt; “Nina, you’ve done me a wonderful favor. **If you ever need anything, or if you have another dream, you can find me at an inn called Anker’s. I play music there.**”
&gt;
&gt; **Her eyes went wide. “Is it magic music?”**
&gt;
&gt; I laughed again. “Some people think so.”
&gt;
&gt; She looked around nervously. “I really have to go!” she said, then waved and took off running toward the river, the wind blowing her hood back as she went.
&gt;
&gt; I carefully rerolled the piece of paper and tucked it back into the hollow piece of horn. My mind spun with what I had just learned. I thought of what I’d heard Haliax say to Cinder all those years ago: *Who keeps you safe from the Amyr, **the Singers**, the Sithe?*

SIDE NOTE:  Singers IS capitalized.  I recall a long-ago discussion on it being changed in NotW from capitalized to lower-case.  My physical copy of WMF has it capitalized in this section.

##  Painting is like telling with pictures instead of words.

&gt; “Plus you said I shouldn’t tell anyone what I saw,” Nina said. “**And painting is like telling with pictures instead of words.**

**If there is *written magic* and *painting is like telling with words* then theoretically there could exist a *painting magic*.**

&gt; She held her hand about three feet off the ground. It was shaking. “It had all sorts of writings and pictures on it. Really fancy. **I haven’t ever seen colors like that. And some of the paints were shiny like silver and gold.**”

Let’s compare what Nina remembers initially with what she ends up painting from her dream. In the order of her painting….

**Cinder, painting:**
&gt; I slowly unrolled the piece of paper and instantly recognized the man she had painted. **His eyes were pure black**. In the background there was a bare tree, and he was standing on a circle of blue with a few wavy lines on it.
&gt;
&gt;  “That’s supposed to be water,” she said, pointing. “**It’s hard to paint water though**. And he’s supposed to be standing on it. There were drifts of snow around him too, and **his hair was white. But I couldn’t get the white paint to work**. Mixing paints for paper is harder than glazes for pots.”
&gt;
&gt; I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. It was Cinder, the one who had killed my parents. I could see his face in my mind without even trying. Without even closing my eyes.

**Cinder, memory:**
&gt; “Was there one with **white hair and black eyes**?”
&gt; She looked at me wide-eyed, nodded. “Gave me the all-overs.” She shivered.

---

**Haliax, painting:**
&gt; I unrolled the paper further. There was **a second man, or rather the shape of a man in a great hooded robe. Inside the cowl of the robe was nothing but blackness. Over his head were three moons, a full moon, a half moon, and one that was just a crescent**. Next to him were two candles. One was yellow with a bright orange flame. The other candle sat underneath his outstretched hand: it was grey with a black flame, and the space around it was smudged and darkened.
&gt;
&gt; “That’s supposed to be shadow, I think,” Nina said, pointing to the area under his hand. “It was more obvious on the pot. **I had to use charcoal for that. I couldn’t get it right with paint.**”
&gt;
&gt; I nodded again.  This was Haliax. The leader of the Chandrian. When I’d seen him he had been surrounded by an unnatural shadow. The fires around him had been strangely dimmed, and the cowl of his cloak had been black as the bottom of a well.

**Haliax, memory:**
&gt; She thought about it. “**There was one with no face, just a hood with nothing inside. There was a mirror by his feet and there was a bunch of moons over him. You know, full moon, half moon, sliver moon.”**

---

**Third figure, painting:**
&gt; I finished unrolling the paper, revealing **a third figure, larger than the other two**. He wore armor and an open-faced helmet. On his chest was a bright insignia that looked like an autumn leaf, red on the outside brightening to orange near the middle, with a straight black stem.
&gt;
&gt; The skin of his face was tan, but the hand he held poised upright was a bright red. His other hand was hidden by a large, round object that Nina had somehow managed to color a metallic bronze. I guessed it was his shield.
&gt;
&gt; **“He’s the worst,” Nina said, her voice subdued.**
&gt;
&gt; I looked down at her. Her face looked somber, and I guessed she’d taken my silence the wrong way. “You shouldn’t say that,” I said. “You’ve done a wonderful job.”
&gt;
&gt; Nina gave a faint smile. “That’s not what I meant,” she said. “**He was hard to do. I got the copper pretty okay here.**” She touched his shield. “**But this red,” her finger brushed his upraised hand, “is supposed to be blood.** He’s got blood all over his hand.” She tapped his chest. “**And this was brighter, like something burning.**”
&gt;
&gt; I recognized him then. It wasn’t a leaf on his chest. It was a tower wrapped in flame. His bloody, outstretched hand wasn’t demonstrating something. It was making a gesture of rebuke toward Haliax and the rest. He was holding up his hand to stop them. This man was one of the Amyr. One of the Ciridae.
&gt;
&gt; **The young girl shivered and pulled her cloak around herself. “I don’t like looking at him even now,” she said. “They were all awful to look at. But he was the worst. I can’t get faces right, but his was terrible grim. He looked so angry. He looked like he was ready to burn down the whole world.”**

**Third figure, memory:**
Nothing.  She gets the basics of Cinder and Haliax.  Her dream adds details to what she already  remembers.  Nina has no recollection of a figure in bright red, larger than the others, and one she described as *the worst*.  Despite having seen all eight figures on the vase the first time:

&gt; “You remembered something about **the pot with the seven people** painted on it?” I asked excitedly.
&gt;
&gt; She hesitated for a moment, frowning. “**There was eight of them,” she said. “Not seven.**”
&gt;
&gt; **“Eight?” I asked. “Are you sure?”**
&gt;
&gt; **She nodded earnestly. “I thought I told you before.”**

---

Post-dream, she only recalls this:
&gt; “If this is one side,” I asked, “Do you remember the rest of it?”
&gt;
&gt; “Not like this. **I remember there was a woman with **no clothes on**, and a broken sword, and a fire. . . .”** She looked thoughtful, then shook her head again.

But her original memory recalls a lot more:
&gt; “People,” she said. “Mostly people. **There was a woman holding a broken sword, and a man next to a dead tree, and another man with a dog biting his leg…**” she trailed off.

&gt; She looked down, thinking. “**And there was a woman…” She blushed. “With some of her clothes off.**”

Nina pre-dream recalls the following people :
* woman holding a broken sword
* a man next to a dead tree
* another man with a dog biting his leg
* one with white hair and black eyes
* one with no face, just a hood with nothing inside
* a woman with some of her clothes off

Nina post-dream :
* Cinder  (says Kvothe)
* Haliax  (says Kvothe)
* the Amyr-Ciridae  (says Kvothe)
* “a woman with no clothes on, and a broken sword, and a fire”

**What if the painting on the pot affected Nina’s perceptions in some way?**
**To put it in Denna’s words:**

&gt; Denna looked embarrassed as she asked, “What if someone told you they knew a type of magic that did more than that? **A magic where you sort of painted ~wrote~ things down, and whatever you painted ~wrote~ became true?”**
&gt;
&gt; She looked down nervously, her fingers tracing patterns on the tabletop. “Then, **if someone saw the painting ~writing~, even if they couldn’t read it, it would be true for them. They’d think a certain thing, or act a certain way depending on what the painting showed ~writing said~ .**” She looked up at us again, her expression a strange mix of curiosity, hope, and uncertainty.

---

&amp;nbsp;

Denna was at the farm.  Did she see the pot?
&gt; She trailed off, frowning. “He has a way of signaling me. A way of letting me know when he's around. I excused myself and found him over by the barn. **We headed into the woods for a bit and he asked me questions. Who was there, how many people, what they looked like.**” She looked thoughtful.
&gt;
&gt; “Now that I'm thinking of it, **I think that was the real test. He wanted to see how observant I was.**”  (NotW ch.72)

Denna’s comments make it seem like he is only concerned with the people there. She doesn’t connect any of her patron’s questions to a pot or heirloom.  Even when she finds out what was dug up:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; “Well that's the greet damn secret, hain't it?” Schiem said bitterly, taking another drink. “From wot I hear, he was out there, diggen the house foundation, an' pullen up stones. **Then he finds a little stone room all sealed up toight. But he makes everybody keep mum about what he finds there** on account he wants et tae be this greet surprise at the wedding.”
&gt;
&gt; “Some sort o' treasure?” I asked.
&gt;
&gt; “Nae money.” He shook his head. “Mauthen's never been quiet aboot that. Et were probably some sort o'…” his mouth opened and closed a bit, searching for a word, “… **what de ye call something old that rich folk put on a shelf tae impress all their grummer friends?**”
&gt;
&gt;  I gave a helpless shrug.
&gt;
&gt;“**An heirloom?**” Denna said.
&gt;
&gt; Schiem laid his finger alongside his nose and then pointed to her, smiling. “That's et. Some flash thing tae impress folk. He's a showy bastard, Mauthen is.” (NotW ch.73)

&amp;nbsp;

We are led to believe that some group wants it and the memory of it erased:
&gt; Denna frowned. “Doesn't hold together. If all they wanted was the item, they could have waited until after the wedding and just killed the newlyweds. Much easier.”
&gt;
&gt; That took some of the wind out of my sails. “You're right.”
&gt;
&gt;“**It would make more sense if what they really wanted was to get rid of all knowledge of the thing.** Like Old King Celon when he thought his regent was going to expose him for treason. Killed the fellow's whole family and burned down their estate to make sure no word got out or evidence was left for anyone to find.”
&gt;
&gt; Denna gestured off to the south. “Since everyone who knew the secret would be at the wedding, **the Chandrian can come in, kill everyone who knows anything, and either destroy or steal whatever it is.**” She made a motion with the flat of her hand. “Clean sweep.”
&gt;
&gt; I sat stunned. Not so much by what Denna had said, which was, of course, better than my own guess. I was remembering what had happened to my own troupe.  (NotW ch.74)

---

## What’s real:  Nina’s dreams or her memory?

&gt; But Denna’s version was different. In her song, **Lanre was painted in tragic tones**, a hero wrongly used. **Selitos’ words were cruel and biting, Myr Tariniel a warren that was better for the purifying fire. Lanre was no traitor, but a fallen hero**.
&gt;
&gt; So much depends upon where you stop a story, and hers ended when Lanre was cursed by Selitos. It was the perfect ending for a tragedy. **In her story Lanre was wronged, misunderstood. Selitos was a tyrant, an insane monster who tore out his own eye in fury at Lanre’s clever trickery**. It was dreadfully, painfully wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Despite this, it had the first glimmers of beauty to it. The chords well-chosen. The rhyme subtle and strong. The song was very fresh, and there were rough patches aplenty, but I could feel the shape of it. I saw what it could become. **It would turn men’s minds. They would sing it for a hundred years.**

---

&gt; Her excitement faded slightly. “**I found a version of it in an old book when I was doing genealogical research for my patron**,” she said.

---
&gt; “I had to **piece it together out of a hundred little scraps.**” She made a conciliatory gesture. “**Me and my patron, I should say. He’s helped.**”  (WMF ch.73)

Denna and her patron.  Arguably the only two survivors in the area of the Mauthen farm.  Independently of Nina they find actual evidence that seems to coincide with Nina’s dream.

Lanre (Haliax) is an almost neutral figure, tragic in the other.
The Amyr (Selitos) is the worst, a monster.

If Denna’s patron was involved with the massacre at the Mauthen farm, why work to suppress the pot but then come out with a song that seems to match it?

Random thoughts and questions :
* Is the pot somehow detrimental to both groups (the Seven and the Amyr)?
* Did Denna and/or her patron see the pot and get affected by it?
* The pot may have true calling names written on it.
* Are the angels truly influencing Nina’s dreams as she thinks?
* Is her patron playing both sides? ex. Cinder undermining Haliax?
* Ultimately is this just Pat’s way of saving something to reveal in WMF?

&amp;nbsp;

Possibly relevant painting and color quotes:
&gt; So the tinker moved on to his second pack. It held rarer things. A gear soldier that marched if you wound him. **A bright set of paints with four different brushes.** A book of secrets. A piece of iron that fell from the sky. . . .  (WMF ch.86)

---
&gt; Chronicler picked up his pen, but before he could dip it, Kvothe held up a hand. “Let me say one thing before I start. I've told stories in the past, **painted pictures with words**, told hard lies and harder truths. **Once, I sang colors to a blind man. Seven hours I played, but at the end he said he saw them, green and red and gold**. (NotW ch.48)

---

&gt; And there were puppets. They hung from shelves and pegs on walls. They lay crumpled in corners and under chairs. Some were in the process of being built or repaired, scattered among tools across the tabletop. There were **shelves full of figurines**, each cleverly carved and **painted in the shape of a person**.  (WMF ch.40)

---

&amp;nbsp;

And finally a really random thought:
Are the three figures from the dream really phases of two people?
We move from Cinder to Haliax to Ciridae.
Cinder is cold, chill, and depicted in snow imagery.
The Ciridae is anger and in fire imagery, red clothing, and a burning tower.

Haliax is in the middle with a light candle, a shadow candle.  A balance.
And three phases of the moon over his head.  A transition.
Or to use Nina’s first impression, a mirror at his feet: a reflection of the two.

WoT meets Rise Against Just finished rereading the WoT series again while listening to Rise against and I feel like this song lyrics describe the Warder/Aes Sedai bond pretty well. Or am I the only one?

Like a new day rising, like a calm before the storm
Like fog lifting from valleys on a sleeping forest floor
Eyes open slowly as the dust is shaken off
To gaze upon the wreckage that the midnight hands have brought.
And now I
I feel my temperature rising.
My body explodes.
I feel like somebody's watching, like I'm not alone,
I stopped I
Vowed right then and said that,
Whatever path you take, wherever you might go,
Whenever you decide to leave,
I will follow, I will follow.
We face a crossroad never knowing what's in store.
There's an angel on my shoulder,
There's a devil at my door
She proclaimed tonight will be the greatest of our lives
And I said don't be so sure let's just wait until the morning light.
I feel my temperature rising.
My body explodes.
I feel like somebody's watching, like I'm not alone,
I stopped I
Vowed right then and said that,
Whatever path you take, wherever you might go,
Whenever you decide to leave,
I will follow, I will follow.
There in the clearing, we gathered close
Under the moon's pale light we laid out the tools.
"And you don't have to do this, and I'd forgive you if you don't"
But she just looked away and said "I know"
Gripped by the midnight hands We dream of futures that would prevent
Gripped by the midnight hands
The line's crossed over
The dawn grows closer
Let's bite off too much
Let's jump with a blind trust
In water over our head
And whatever path you take, and wherever you might go,
And whenever you decide to leave,
I will follow, I will follow, I will
Bear all falls you take, I won't let go if you decided to stray
I'll be there until you don't wake up, yeah, I will follow, I will follow
I will follow
(whatever path you take)
I will follow
(wherever you might go, I will follow)
I will follow
(whenever you decide to leave)
I will follow.

I just drank out of my cat's water mug. It's been on the table for like a week. What really smart thing have you done recently? Originally just had -  Wot he said ^

but apparently that wasn't enough text.

So allow me to paraphrase my friend up there:

Flat spot at 5 psi and a ghost in the low beam left headlight. (RB20DET 180SX) As the title suggests I have a flat spot where the engine doesn't miss but you can feel it bog down coming on boost at 5 PSI and above, it feels down on power in the 1-2k rpm at WOT as well  but once its up above 4k it pulls well and builds speed normally. I've logged (stock) ECU and the only reading that looks off is the voltage going to the ecu which hovers around 11 and sometimes drops to as low as 10, but unsure if this is related, I know the car has some electrical gremlins like headlight (drivers side pop up) low beam doesn't work 98% of the time yet when you test the bulb in the other side it works fine and the when I test the wires the low beam shows 12v and the high beam shows 12v when they are on so this has me and my mechanic house mate absolutely stuffed as to whats going on, before the drivers side stopped working most of the time it would take 3-5 seconds longer to turn on than the passenger side (though they'd both pop up at the same time so that circuit is fine).
In regards to the engine trouble what I do know is:
- Alternators getting power to the battery at 14.3v
- I've checked for boost leaks, there is a bit of an exhaust leak which I'm fixing tomorrow but that can't be the issue as the turbo still builds boost fine with the revs
- the afr's seem fine (14.5 at idle, 13's at low boost and 12-10 at higher boost/rpm)
- boost is stock 10psi
- fuel pump is new dw200
- fuel pressure is stock 40psi and rises 1:1 on throttle.

I'm really at a loss as to whats going on, I plan on running a new earth and possibly ignition power cable to the ECU in the morning but not very confident this will fix any of the issues except the poor voltage reading in the ECU so any suggestions or insight is very welcome!

My tune journey. Just got my tunes back from Price over at 5 Star Tuning.

Wow.

I THOUGHT i was driving a "tuned" truck with the Edge CTS2...boy was I wrong.

I immediately felt a difference with throttle response. (this maaay be partial to me having the Edge Throttle booster, which sends different signals to the TPS to give a move throttle cable feeling) but I had this on before the tune and the throttle response was better than stock for sure, but now its amazing.

The 1-4 shifts upon stop and get up is phenomenal every gear stays in the 2000-2200 RPM range where torque is had. Then 5-6 drops down low as it should once I get up to speed.

WOT trans shifts hard and quick at 6K RPM! So rev limit got raised which is nice.

Freeway driving is a pleasure now as I dont have to drop down to 3rd to go anywhere, just give it some gas and it moves, even in 6th.

Dead stop to about 70 is quick for sure for only being intake tune and exhaust. Ill get a video and seconds hopefully soon.

Overall, couldn't be happier and money well spent, this truck is such a pleasure to drive now I can see myself owning it for 10 years +

Audi a7 2012 3.0tdi with wonky trans. Well, seems like my car that i bought like two days ago is mad at me.  Was doing a WOT onto a highway when the car started shifting back and forth,reving up and down etc.

Pulled out my trusty wonko-meter to read out the error codes and i got some bad ones. :

P17E1 (sensor for gear act 2)
p17e2 (sensor gear act 3)
p17d4(vavle 3 in trans mechanical malfunction)
p17d0 (clutch 2 slippage)

My guess would be a wonky sensor in the mechatronics unit or a bad seal so there isnt enough pressure supplied to clutch 2 pack.  But id love to hear what you guys think is wrong.

The mouth kink? First post in reddit, ever - but I wanted to share it somewhere. Pardon me please.

So, during the past few visits to my regular dentist, I have been more conscious about how his hands are handling my mouth. I try not to think too much into it but it slightly arouses me when he gently runs his finger against my gums, how he pries my mouth open and reassure that “This is going to hurt a little” and instead of having a panic attack I go straight into kinkland.

Just today, I did a crown impression and he placed something like a dental clay in my mouth and whilst waiting for it to firm up, he gently caressed and stroked my lips downwards to encapsulate the clay onto my canines. I almost shot out of the chair of embarrassment (I shut my eyes tightly as a reaction in case I was blushing).

Also, I can’t speak since I have my mouth full so when he tells me what he’s going to do next I can only “whimper?” in agreement? Lol.

Backstory: I may have hated dentists, any mouth work because of dental pain and gum injections all my life. But this dentist, it’s different - I feel extremely safe with him even though injections are still gross but I’m not as afraid when he does it.

Do I have some type of complex or something? Or a pretty subtle BDSM thingie? Or it could be a latex thing (not possible?) I don’t know, my god. I’m so flushed from reliving those thoughts.

As I write this WOT I think I see the common denominators are “gentle but firm”, “respectful to my feelings”, “control” too?

P.s I absolutely love giving heads (a mouth thing too?) sorry if I’m going in circles here.

TL:DR
Hated dentists. New dentist holds my jaw and gum and sends me to kink heaven.

Then thou shalt suffer in alternate years  **Then thou shalt suffer in alternate years**
The new-reaped fields to rest, and on the plain
A crust of sloth to harden; or, when stars
Are changed in heaven, there sow the golden grain
Where erst, luxuriant with its quivering pod,
Pulse, or the slender vetch-crop, thou hast cleared,
And lupin sour, whose brittle stalks arise,
A hurtling forest. For the plain is parched
By flax-crop, parched by oats, by poppies parched
In Lethe-slumber drenched. Nathless by change
The travailing earth is lightened, but stint not
With refuse rich to soak the thirsty soil,
And shower foul ashes o'er the exhausted fields.
Thus by rotation like repose is gained,
Nor earth meanwhile uneared and thankless left.
Oft, too, 'twill boot to fire the naked fields,
And the light stubble burn with crackling flames;
Whether that earth therefrom some hidden strength
And fattening food derives, or that the fire
Bakes every blemish out, and sweats away
Each useless humour, or that the heat unlocks
New passages and secret pores, whereby
Their life-juice to the tender blades may win;
Or that it hardens more and helps to bind
The gaping veins, lest penetrating showers,
Or fierce sun's ravening might, or searching blast
Of the keen north should sear them. Well, I wot,
He serves the fields who with his harrow breaks
The sluggish clods, and hurdles osier-twined
Hales o'er them; from the far Olympian height
Him golden Ceres not in vain regards;
And he, who having ploughed the fallow plain
And heaved its furrowy ridges, turns once more
Cross-wise his shattering share, with stroke on stroke
The earth assails, and makes the field his thrall.
Pray for wet summers and for winters fine,
Ye husbandmen; in winter's dust the crops
Exceedingly rejoice, the field hath joy;
No tilth makes Mysia lift her head so high,
Nor Gargarus his own harvests so admire.
Why tell of him, who, having launched his seed,
Sets on for close encounter, and rakes smooth
The dry dust hillocks, then on the tender corn
Lets in the flood, whose waters follow fain;
And when the parched field quivers, and all the blades
Are dying, from the brow of its hill-bed,
See! see! he lures the runnel; down it falls,
Waking hoarse murmurs o'er the polished stones,
And with its bubblings slakes the thirsty fields?
Or why of him, who lest the heavy ears
O'erweigh the stalk, while yet in tender blade
Feeds down the crop's luxuriance, when its growth
First tops the furrows? Why of him who drains
The marsh-land's gathered ooze through soaking sand,
Chiefly what time in treacherous moons a stream
Goes out in spate, and with its coat of slime
Holds all the country, whence the hollow dykes
Sweat steaming vapour?

Car buying story, how we ended up with 18 WRX manual GF's old 2001 CRV was about to kick the bucket, CV joints were making noises, underbody was rusted through. She needed a new car and needed it fast. Budget was around 30K, it had to be a sedan, 4 door, and fun to drive with 250+ HP. We planned on not replacing the car for a long time to maintenance outside warranty had to be cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

First we tested the Mazda 6 2.5T. Like this sub says, premium feeling interiors. Peppy, engine. Great car for the price. But something was missing. Steering was heavy, didn't want to turn in and it would get heavier while accelerating out of corners. GF didn't quite love the looks of it either. But it was a great choice on paper, and we kept it on our shortlist.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we tested the Challenger RT (RWD) and GT (AWD). OMG! Dodge interiors looks archaic and crappy. Driving the RT, I was smiling all the way through the test drive, while my GF was a little intimidated driving it. There is something about fast and loose cars that make them such a joy to drive. Lots of body roll, but it likes to be steered with the throttle. The GT however had heavy steering, and couldn't be steered with the throttle. I had my doubts with FCA reliability, and GF read about recalls due to cruise control that wouldn't turn off and took the Challenger off our list.

&amp;#x200B;

I also asked around for prices on used Lexus models, IS 250, 300, but the prices were too high for a used car with 40K+ mileage.

&amp;#x200B;

We were ready to pull the trigger on the Mazda 6, but we decided to give the WRX a try anyway. It wasn't top of our list because I don't trust CVT reliability and GF couldn't drive a manual. We went for a test drive, I drove manual and GF drove CVT. I have driven manuals all my life, but I stalled it twice just getting out of parking, and once at a light. Man, the clutch was touchy. The handling however, was on a different level than the other cars we tested. So quick and precise to turn in, minimal body roll, totally point and shoot, and can be totally WOT out of a corner with so much confidence. GF loved the handling, the precision made her feel safe and the responsiveness made her enjoy the experience. Another thing that she loved was the tons of visibility out of the driver's seat; better than any car I or she has driven. Interiors were just fine for her, she didn't find it worse than the Mazda. Rear seats were spacious and comfortable, so it ticked all the boxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I had tried teaching her to drive a stick in my Tacoma, but its overall size and poor visibility didn't do her much favors. She quit after she unintentionally launched (literally clutch dumped) my Tacoma from a stop sign. I didn't have high hopes for her picking the manual, but she loved the car. So, with a little bit of encouragement, she bites the bullet, and I drive the new car home. We didn't trade in the CRV yet so she could go to work, but we training had begun. WRX with the touchy clutch and throttle is not the ideal car to learn how to drive a stick in, but she preferred it to the unwieldy Taco. It took us a few weekends of practice, lots of stalling and smelly clutches, but he finally has it down. The CRV has been sold and I have turned my GF into a manual enthusiast now :)

A 40k fanfic I found, thought y'all would like it This is a post from /wp. I take ZERO credit for it but found it hilarious.

Harbinger slowly drifted towards the busy world on the edge of the galaxy. Previous scans showed a promising level of biomass and activity, perfect for an initial pool of pawns for the coming salvation. The rest of the fleet was not far behind and needed to move quickly due to the apparent size of this cycle. Harbinger broke through the atmosphere, ominously on a vector towards the largest city on the populated rock. Backed by a dark mechanical hum the giant Reaper touched down in the sprawling mass of what appeared to be a city. The first step was well under way.

"Assuming direct con-"

OI! WOTS DAT FING?

Boss iz looks like one uv-

SHUT UP! IZ SEEN A FISHY BEFORE. I aint neva seen a fishy wit a shiny eye like dat one der.... I WANT IT. GET ALL DA BOYZ AND GET DAT GIT

Harbinger heard the faint sound of a single lifeform yelling from the top of makeshift tower then firing a crude weapon in the sky. Suddenly the screaming and firing spread like wildfire though the city. Every corner of every structure seemed to explode into a stream of oversized rounds directly at the Reaper. The Orks were met with a response from the ancient reaper, the reverberating sound of the main laser weapon rang out as entire swaths of the city were wiped away. The settling dust from these scars revealed more the excited and increasingly motivated orks looting the largest weapons from the dead and continuing to fire. Ork ships were now swarming the Reaper in seemingly random flight paths. The makeshift navy was attacking in various forms ranging from a stream of bullets, catapults launching orks at the giant Reaper, or violently ramming into the hull. Harbinger had never encounter a race so ingrained in violence.

BOSS! Our shipz iz doin' nuthing. Our shootas aint even wurth it. Wot do we do Boss?

Warboss Gutrippa thought for a split second. Every fiber of his being poured into concentrating on a solution. This was is biggest fight and the most important so far. Suddenly a rare moment of Ork clarity. He knew, without a doubt, what needs to be done.

WEZ AINT GOT OUR FISHIN' HATZ! GET ALLZ DA BOYZ TO TURN ER' HELMETZ UN HATZ TO DA SIDE A BIT. SEE? NOW ITZ A FISHIN' HAT AND NOW WE CAN KRUMP DAT SHINY FISH!

Harbinger sensed a moment of silence as the entire planet seemed to stop moving. All scans showed the lifeforms seemingly adjusting their helmets, and other various activities. Shortly after a shattering explosion of gunfire began again. This time the rounds ripped through the hull of the ancient Reaper, alerts from every system rang through the processor as breaches populated at an alarming rate. What is this?! How? He had never encountered resistance like this before. Panic set in for the first time in eons. He had to leave, regroup and glass the planet with the Reaper fleet. Just as the Reaper was set to retreat from the surface, the largest Ork ship appeared. Warboss Gutrippa stood at the mast of the massive ship, a large makeshift harpoon in one hand and a fishing rod with the end of the line being a machine gun in the other. As the ship picked up speed, Gutrippa swung the fishing rod above his head in a lassoing motion, the machine gun at the end now firing non stop. The Fishing boat rammed through the Ancient purifier. The Reaper went silent, with its hull collapsing into the city.

As the dust settled and the swarms of Orks and Gretchin began looting the corpse, Warboss Gutrippa Fishgutaa looked to the sky. The rest of the Reaper fleet was descending.

LISTEN UP BOYZ! WAAAGH!!!!

[troubleshoot request] Husqvarna 322L line trimmer hesitates going idle to wot I have an almost new line trimmer that is about 4 months old. It's been used once weekly/fortnightly since purchase. As the title suggests, it hesitates when going from idle to wide open throttle, with a distinct sound.
It isn't noticeable when opening the throttle slowly.


The fuel was new (premium 98) when it started happening, and hasn't gotten worse as the fuel aged a month (stabilised).
The air filter looks clean (and it still happens with it removed altogether). Spark arrestor also looks pristine.


Having read over otjer post here for a few days, and watching youtube trouble fix clips I think it could be the low mix setting on the carb, but its got splined screws for which I dont have to tool to play with (nor do i have a spark plug tool or gap guages). Before I get the proper tools I'd kindly appreciate the input of someone else

Landlord charging us full replacement of carpet before attempting cleaning. WOT INCOMING!

**TLDR: GF and i moved, told LL we would start moving stuff 15th and she took it as us giving our move out date, not giving us enough time to make repairs and clean properly. Later sent us a text saying she wouldn't have carpet clean and would just replace. with other repairs would cost our security deposit as well as 1/2 months prorated rent. HELP!**


So my GF and i recently received a 60-day notice from our landlord (a family friend) and instantly found our next place within 2 weeks.

We let our landlord know that we would be able move our stuff out starting the 15th of January, only 14 days after receiving notice. She let us know that she would stop by that day to check out the place and get a list of repairs that need to be done. While doing her walk through, which she specifically said was not a "final walk through", she noticed some stains that look bad but have never been professionally cleaned. There were some other small repairs; hole in the wall from moving furniture, a small 1in. by 6in. section of carpet that my cat had scratched up trying to get into 2nd room. When she was leaving she informed us that she had made an appointment to have carpet cleaners show up next day and needed our stuff out by next day, 16th of January. We told her we never said we were OUT the 15th only that she we were able to start moving stuff the 15th. Being a family friend she informed us of the living situation she was in, which wasn't the best tbh, and needed to move ASAP. The mistake we made was telling her we would make an effort but would need as much additional time as possible to finish all cleaning and repairs. She gave us till the 16th.

OUR PLAN was to move majority of our stuff on the 15th and through the rest of the week clean and make any repairs that were necessary. After hearing she had made appointments for carpet cleaners and plans to move in her stuff starting the next day, we were forced to pack, repair and clean by 9am on the 16th.

After she left she sent us a text stating she was foregoing carpet cleaning and was just going to replace it. She had shopped around and the CHEAPEST she could find was $2000, which would be the amount of our security deposit and the rest of or prorated rent.

I KNOW my landlord needs to attempt to clean carpet before replacing but she seems not to want to waste that money and just replace it. What can i do to fight this? Stains could easily be cleaned but she wont. Also, with being practically kicked out we were unable to make any simple repairs which I'm sure she will charge us at a markup. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance.

Accessport first impressions! Alright so I sent it and got the accessport and am running COBB stage 1 tune. I’ve had it for less than 24 hours and have driven the car for about an hour so I can only give initial impressions. But so far, I would say it’s different. I haven’t gone WOT yet cause I want to make sure all the numbers check out, but as far as normal driving; the throttle isn’t as touchy. So when starting you have to give it a bit more gas compared to the stock tune. Rev hang is still there but it’s noticeably better. And boost seems to be more progressive compared to just getting slapped by it and then it dying off. I’ve only taken the rpm up to about 5k so we will see but like I said boost seems to build more progressively up to that point. Will give updated impressions as time goes on.

Red Dead- Adler's Ailing First time ever writing smut, but I've read enough to feel a little bit confident to try this out. may add a part 2, I dunno.

&amp;#x200B;

"You know," Sadie looked up at the heavy canopy above her, "I never thought it would be so beautiful around here."

West Elizabeth was indeed a pretty place. Still to be tamed by ever expanding civilization, it was the last haven for untamed nature. As well as the scarce gangs that were hunted out of the west.

Arthur shook his head as he reigned his horse to a canter, "I don't think I have an opinion to that matter." he commented on the scenery. The outlaw wasn't keen on pretty things. Considering his grungy attire and the worn hat on his head, it seemed the only thing he considered to clean was the pistol on his belt and the horse he rode on.

Sadie rolled her eyes, "Oh come on, you got to know some thing about pretty. Haven't you been spending time out in town?"

"Buying provisions for camp."

"And what about your little expedition in Saint Denis? With the french painter that made all them nudes?"

A gravelly laugh rumbled in Arthur's chest as he shook his head at her, "Trust me, that ain't pretty. Humorous, lewd, a bit *disgusting* maybe. But ain't pretty."

The two chuckled as they rode on, but Sadie stopped smiling. A low grumble echoed through the forest, and for a moment, the birds stopped to listen to what it was."

Arthur stared up at the trees, "Thunder maybe? Clouds seem to be rolling over."

"Yeah," Sadie replied quickly, "I bet that was it."

He glanced at her with a worried look. She wasn't the cheery, stand-on-her-own self anymore. For some reason, she seemed to be hunched over on her horse. A pained look had spread across her face.

"You okay?" he queried.

"Yeah," her face was tight with pain as she tried for a smile, "Mighty fine."

"Sadie, you don't look too fine."

"Arthur, don't worry about me. I'll be-"

She was interrupted by a recognizable sound. It reverberated on her saddle before fading in the soft breeze. Arthur's nose may have been in poor condition since Blackwater, but he could detect the scent of something rotten.

He raised his eyebrows, "Sounds like your horse is in some trouble. I have some-"

"That wasn't the horse, Arthur." she snapped at him, "I think we need to stop."

PPBLBLRT.

This time, the sound was unmistakable. Arthur recoiled at it first, then groaned, "Fine then. But make it quick."

They took a turn off the dirt road and into the woods. Strapping their horses reins to a nearby tree, Arthur watched as Sadie stood anxiously around the brush, her eyes jumping from one spot to another. Every once in awhile she would wince and lower her behind to the ground

BRROOOT, SPLRBRT.

"Jesus," Arthur fanned the air, "This from last night?"

"And the night before." Sadie moaned, "I haven't shit in a couple days now."

The outlaw muttered a few curses before beckoning at her, "Fine then. Just hurry it up."

Sadie stared at him in horror, "I can't shit with you right here! I need to find a place, like a log or a stump-"

"Look, this is bear country. I don't want to get in a fight with grizzly why'll you're crappin your guts out. Besides, I've seen Mrs. Grimshaw do it enough times."

He took a few steps back before turning away, "if it makes you feel better, I won't look,"

The widow's face grew beet red, but she complied. Dropping her trousers, she squatted and braced herself for the worse, "Can't believe I'm doing this.

BRSHSPLRLRT! BRAAARRRP! SPLSHRT!

She grunted as she pushed, letting her business fall in the underbrush. The crackling of leaves crunched with a satisfying noise as pressure broke them apart.

Arthur chuckled, waving his hand over his face, "Whew, and I thought Mrs. Grimshaw was bad!"

"Shut up, Arthur!" she hissed.

PPPPOOOOOORRRLLLLLAAAAARRRRRRRPPPPPTT! SCHHHHHLLLLOOOOOOOORRRRRPPPPP! PLOOORRPT! PLOOOP! PLOP!

"Um, you finished," Arthur called out in a hushed tone, "Cause I-"

"No, Arthur, I'm not done!"

POOOORRRRRLPPPPPPARRRLLPT!

"Sadie, you really should be." He said with warning, "I don't think we have time."

"By god," she put her hands to her face, "What now?"

Arthur unholstered his revolver, pulling back the hammer, "We've got O'Driscolls!"

Sure enough, there was a loud commotion ahead. The sound of voices and heavy boots crashing through the underbrush. Two hundred feet away, about ten men were sauntering over, green scarves wrapped around their necks. Most of them carried pistols, and a few of them had rifles.

"Shit!" Sadie whispered before another wave of waste passed through her, PRRRRRRPT! PPAARRRPT! "Where the hell did they come from?"

"Probably trying to flush out our camp." Arthur put a finger to his mouth, "Try to stay quiet."

A flurry of hushed curses came from Sadie as she repositioned herself. As she continued her business, softer farts escaped their confines. PRFT. PLORT. PRRRT.

As the O'Driscolls passed by, one stopped and looked up in the sky. Judging by the wrinkling in his nose, he detected something foul.

"Ey," he elbowed his friend, "ya smell that?"

"I don't smell nothin," the other gang member grumbled, "Now shut up."

"Smells like shite, if you ask me."

"I didn't ask you, now shut up before I shoot you." he nudged him with his rifle before sauntering forwards.

Arthur nodded, "Looks like they don't detect us. You're doing great." He turned to Sadie, and his face dropped. The look of desperation on her own face was unbearable. Her body quivered as she tried to hold the rest in. Shaking her head, she whispered to Arthur,

"I'm sorry."

PPPLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPP!
PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEERRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPTTTT!
PLLLLOOOOOPP! PLLLOOORRPP!

the sound was deafening, even louder than the steamships in Saint Denis. Louder than a rifle's report, and defintely loud enough for the O'Driscolls to notice.

They all stopped, raising their guns to their hips as they tried to search for the sound, "Wot da hell was that?" one said

"Sounded like thunder." another suggested.

Sadie was biting down on her tongue as she bored down on her load. the splattering sound was only overpowered by the foghorn blowing out followed by the raunchy stench that emitted from her behind, PPRRRRRPAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTT!

"Sounded like a bear." an O'Driscoll put his scarf up to his nose, "Smells like one too."

**PPPPRPT! PPPAAARRRPT! POOORRRRLLLPPT! PPRRRRPT! PFFFFFFRRT!**

Arthur hunkered down, covering his own face with his bandana, "Goddammit Sadie!" he scream-whispered.

She didn't hear him, too much in euphoria on feeling the weight exit her body. Her eyes were rolled up in her skull, a broad smile on her face.

**PAARRRRRPPPLLLLLLLAARRRPTT!**

"you know, my cousin was killed by a bear." An O'Driscoll commented, "Just by Manzanita Post, a few minutes from here."

The one in the center began jogging away, "Well, I don't want to be caught with a damn grizzly. We got to get outta here!"

The rest began following his lead, keeping their low caliber weapons leveled in case a bear wanted to tangle with them. Lucky for them- and lucky for the two outlaws- they were fast enough to evade the area, just enough for Sadie to finish up.

**PPAAAAAARRRRRRPLLLLLLLPPPTT!  she sighed as she swept** her hair out of her face. Sweat poured down her brow as she grinned ear to ear, "That felt amazing." she gloated.

Arthur took a glance at her creation. Both disgusted and intrigued, he took out his journal and scrawled a sketch of the scene, "Gonna keep this for a record. I don't think I've seen *bears* shit this much in my life."

Pulling up her trousers, Sadie patted him on the shoulder, "You better show that to some pawn money. Next time we go to Valentine, you're buying me new pants."

Turbo R32 issues. Could use some advice. I recently installed a CTS kit on my Mk4. I'm running low boost (6psi) bc it's a daily. The tune is from United.
The issue is, if I'm in a given gear, we'll say 2nd for example, and go WOT between 2-3k rpm, it pulls nicely as expected.
However if I start at 4-5k rpm at WOT there is almost no pull. In fact I'd say it felt stock.
It's the same 6lbs, no leaks, fuel is there. (11.8-12) but timing pulls like a bitch, then has to build back up.
It's like the sudden influx of air that rpm overwhelms the MAF sensor, and causes timing to be pulled.
I think it's either limitations of a MAF only system, or bc its a box-tune.
This was also the case on another vrt project I did, (different tune) and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with it. And for the life of me I cannot find anyone who dyno tunes these..

Followers of the Stars I don't know if this is the correct place to post this I'm going to try anyway.


The spaceport was busier than usual. Most of the time there were a few thousand people, mainly tourists coming to see the famous Pantheon of Statues, but now there were significantly more. Jarrik Covan had been in the same line for 5 hours  and was getting bored. He could make out the shape of an overweight Transportation Officer checking passports and eating a diet bar, his checkpoint almost completely overrun by people trying to get off world.


Mr Covan would certainly like it if he got on to the transport ship before dark but that was becoming more and more unlikely. He looked down at his briefcase, the briefcase that would get him off the hell-hole of a planet. You see, Jarrik Covan was not on the good side of Pachi City's Law Enforcers, and the sooner he got off the planet, the safer he would be. Inside was a very large stack of Units meant for the Transportation Officer. Spaceport security officers patrolled the area, making sure nothing out of the ordinary was occurring. Jarrik lowered his head, as the security officers walked past. One of them stopped, and at first he thought the man recognised him, but he realised the security officer was going after a teenage Palferan male who was hastily stuffing illegal drugs down his shirt. He sighed with relief as the two security officers disappeared out of sight. Maybe he would get out of here after all.

Then the ground shook. People looked around confused, but then the security checkpoint erupted into flames, killing everyone in and around it. More explosions went off. People ran around looking for any means of escape. Security officers tried to restore order, but to no avail. Another explosion lifted Jarrik up off his feet and flung him towards the remains of the checkpoint, his body lay on the floor, unconscious. Then the true slaughter began. Armoured terrorists walked into the spaceport, guns blazing. Their bullets cut down countless civillians as they ran, pools of blood forming around their bodies. One brave Halbarian female picked up a pistol from a dead security officer and started shooting at the terrorists, who just shrugged off the bullets and cut her down, her face almost completely obliterated.


One of the terrorists took off their helmet, and breathed in the air. The Zal male looked around at his men (for he was the leader) cutting down the Faithless Ones. He held up his hand and the shooting stopped. "Bring the survivors to me. Have them kneeling down with their hands behind their backs. We shall give them a choice." He said, his voice loud enough to fill the whole hall. Replies trickled back in from the rest of the terrorists and they set about to work. Jarrik Covan played dead on the floor, not wanting to be given this "choice", as it probably involved death. He was right. "Faithless Ones, I am Shorl Baku, leader of this certain sect of the Followers of the Stars," The Zal half shouted half preached, "you can either follow the Bright Gods' in life, or you can feed them in death." His men set to work asking the 126 survivors the same question individually. None of them agreed to join them in their righteous quest. Shorl Baku was disappointed of course but at least he had rid the world of some Faithless Ones.


Jarrik Covan was just drifting off to sleep when a massive hand slammed into his back and grabbed him by the scruff of the neck. "I've got a survivor 'ere boss!" The brute called out.
"Good work Bahi, good work." Was the reply.
"Wot shod I do with 'im?" The brute called Brahi said, quiter this time.
"Bring him here, maybe he will Co-operate more than the others."
"Wot duz corporait mean?"
"It doesn't matter, bring him here now otherwise you will anger the Great Sun!" The leader shouted angrily. Jarrik's body slammed into the floor with such great force he thought he broke his right leg. "You seem to be a fine specimen mister..."
"Covan. Jarrik Covan. At your service." Jarrik said. His legs trembled but his voice remained strong.
"Already we have gotten on better than your friends here." The Zal pointed at the corpses covering the floor.
"Ah, yes. Um... you have quite brutal methods don't you?" Jarrik said, hoping not to anger the Zal.
"It is necessary. Every soul killed in the Bright gods' names feed their energy." The leader explained, as if it was a obvious fact that everyone should know.
"Yeah. Sure. But um... you're not going to kill me are you?" Jarrik said, both confused and scared.
"I would certainly hope not to Mr Covan. As long as you help me that is." The leader said coldly.
"What do you need doing?" Jarrik asked, unsure.
"A few odds and ends. My assistant will explain later," The leader said. As if on cue, the shouts belonging to Law Enforcers started up a few rooms away. "This would be a good time to leave. For both of us." Jarrik nodded.


"Oh and one last thing Mr Covan. If you run away and try to escape from us, we will kill you. But it won't be a bullet to the head. It will be slow, unending torture that finishes you off. Everyone and everything that knows even the slightest detail about you will suffer and die, and the reports will come flooding in while we torture you."

So I met pyro... I saw pyro in a grocery store in Englandistan yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said "Oh, like you're doing now?"

I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "Huh? Huh? Huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen boxes of cat food in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice and professional about it and was like "Sir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tried and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the boxes and started to scan it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually "to prevent any petscop 2 infetterence" then turned around and creepily licked his lips at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Anyway, I walk out behind pyro and realize I'm running late, so I ask him the time. I asked pyro and the second he opened his mouth to answer, I knew I had awoken a lifeless-yet-living god from like, a hundred dimensions above us.

He looks at me and goes "ARE YOU FOOKIN WIMBLY FOURS MATE?! IT'S CRIMBO NINAN SAX APPLE SMIBBLY DIN BIBBLY, CHAP!"

I had no idea what he'd just said so I asked him to repeat it.

"U FOOKIN WOT M8? YOU ARE ONE CHEEKY CUNT! I'LL SMACK YOU IN THE GOBBER, I SWARE ON ME MUM!"

He then begins laughing maniacally but is interrupted by the chimes of Big Ben. Six chimes. Not only pyro, but every single Englishman stopped dead in the street.

A motherfucking carriage with the initials HRH that was rolling down the street stops dead in its tracks and some clearly drunken old women flings the top half of her body out the window.

She said "OI! DID YOU GITS FOOKIN 'EAR THAT? IT BE 6 BONG!"

The carriage driver turns around, lifting his curled mustache so the woman could properly hear him. "SIX BONGERS?"

Pyro ripped his dirty t-shirt open, exposing his flabby, hairy mantits. "SIX FEKKIN BONG!"

People started pouring into the streets, I shit you not. In the soul-burning chanting of "SIX A-BONG, SIX A-BONG!" I managed to hear "YA WANKERS, IT BE CRIMBO SEVEN A BONG!"

Store clerks and chimney sweeps surge into the street like fucking ants and begin singing the song that ends the world.

"SIX A-BONG, SIX A-BONG, OLLY JOLLY IT'S SIX A-BONG!"
"BANG UP THE KNACKERS, SMACK YER MUM"
"OLL IN THE STREETS IT'S SIX A-BONG!"

Fish and chips get thrown in the air en masse and in the haze I see ali a somewhere in the distance, SIX A-BONG-ing with the best of them.

Still, it was really fucking nice to meet pyro

How sensitive are spark plug gaps on BMW N52 engines? Hello BMW Reddit.

I have a 2008 128i with *N52B30* engine (USA).  132k miles.  i bought used at 110k miles.

I changed the spark plugs with NGK ILZFR6D11 at lets say at 120k miles.   I got a small idling problem on a warmed up car idling at a stoplight where the RPM goes down 50-100rpm then back up (feels like misfires).  The idle problem wasnt happening to often,  but as i put more miles on the plugs the jumpy idle occurs more often and lasts longer.   I did not have a idle problem before plug change.  And the car drives and accelerates WOT without any hiccups.  No CEL every from 10k miles of rough idle.

Today i took the valve cover off and doubled checked my spark plug installation.  Everything was connected properly and coils were inserted correctly.  The problem did not go away.

I am using NGK ILZFR6D11.  The preset GAP from the specs is 0.043 in (1.10mm).  I did not double check the gap with a tool.

Another plug used in the car is BOSCH FR7NPP332.  This plug has GAP Specs of 0.039in (1.00mm).

I wanted to ask how sensitive are the N52 engine towards spark plug gaps.  Will 0.10mm difference cause my car to idle rough?

I am going to pull all my plugs out and double check my plug gap. And regap if necessary.  If that doesnt fix it i am going to get new ignition coils.  Right now i have 5X Bosch and 1X Bremi brand ignition coils from the previous owner . . . maybe ignition coils has gone bad ?

Here is a picture of a plug i pulled out: [https://imgur.com/a/adlg9n3](https://imgur.com/a/adlg9n3)

The Flames of a Journey (The Hanreid Chronicles, Pt 1) This story takes place roughly 300 BCE.



A very large man with dark brown hair with streaks of black and dottings of white stood before a collection of a few dozen people. They were scared, huddling around one another. Some holding spears or whatever crude weaponry they could make to defend themselves, while others had stockpiles of rats and rabbits stored up in baskets they were carrying. "We can't do this anymore. We've been running from the Aduta's for generations now, but there has to be something we can do..." The large man shouted out in frustration. He flexed and shot his wings out of his shoulder blades. "We all have these useless things and can't do much more than just... Float."


One of the less scared individuals shouts out at the time, "Unless you jump down from a tree! Like Corrick! Do you remember that Hanried?"


"Yes, Corrick was able to do a lot when he started from high up. I think we need to ascend to the cliffs, we could glide downwards and fight off the Aduta that way. Throw spears from the sky or stab at them as we float above them. We need to do something or else we won't last too much longer." The large man responded back to the much smaller individual. "I'll ascend the cliffs. I'll fight back. Will you?"


There were more cheers than there were detractors, so the man started packing up his stuff. "Plesum. Go get Corrick as well as Nefiltye. Corrick knows the most about gliding and Nefiltye has been able to use the winds more often. They could be useful going forward." He spoke calmly to Plesum, the man that spoke during his rally. Plesum nodded his head vigorously and went to go find the other two he was ordered to bring.


After a few minutes a tall flubby man with red, green and white hair walked back scratching at the wings on his back. He was accompanied by a slim woman with black, white grey and brown hair. The man spoke first, "'Ey Hanreid. Wot ye got planned up this time?"


"I must say, I'm curious as well. It's not often that the clan actually has a request for a Windcaller."


"I know it goes against tradition Nefiltye, but I want you to call the winds and have Corrick teach us how to use them. If our people wish to survive against the Aduta, that's a skill that will be absolutely necessary going forward. If we can glide and imitate the birds, maybe we can fight back against their pounces. Stay out of reach, pepper them with spears from a distance while you keep the winds on us." Hanreid spoke, gritting his teeth as he did so.


"Com' on Niffy! It'll be fun. Who know's, maybe you'll be allowed to camp with the rest of us."


"And be forced to deal with your blubbering mess? I'd rather not. Although I do agree that if the Aduta aren't taken care of, our people won't last much longer. I'll risk the punishment and create a great wind going northwards in the morning. Corrick, Hanreid you make sure the people start trying to use their wings and this just might work. Throw Plesum if you have to, he's light enough."


The trio all nodded at each other and then proceeded to go seperate ways. The next morning would be a difficult one and everyone needed proper rest for the coming day. The flames of a journey had been stoked, and the four heroes were finally united once again. It was only a matter of time before the Cornoth tribe made something of itself.

Oliver Twist : Chapter 3     By Charles Dickens


             RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR
             GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
                             A SINECURE


         FOR a week after the commission of the impious and profane
         offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner
         in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned
         by the wisdom and mercy of the board.  It appears, at first
         sight, not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained
         a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gen-
         tleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established
         that sage individual's prophetic character, once and for ever,
         by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the
         wall, and attaching himself to the other.  To the performance
         of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that
         pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had
         been, for all future times and ages , removed from the noses
         of paupers by the express order of the board, in council as-
         sembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands
         and seals.  There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver's youth
         and childishness.  He only cried bitterly all day; and, when
         the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before
         his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner,
         tried to sleep: ever and anon sleeping with a start and tremble,
         and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to
         feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom
         and loneliness which surrounded him.
            Let it not be supposed by the enemies of "the system,"
         that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver
         was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or
         the advantages of religious consolation.  As for exercise, it was
         nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablu-
         tions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the
         presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold,
         and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by re-
         peated applications of the cane.  As for society, he was car-
         ried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and
         there sociably flogged as a public warning and example.  And
         so far from being denied the advantages of religious consola-
         tion, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at
         prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his
         mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a
         special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in
         which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented,
         and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of
         Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to
         be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the pow-
         ers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufac-
         tory of the very Devil himself.
            It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this
         auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chim-
         ney-sweep, went his way down High Street, deeply cogi-
         tating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain
         arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather
         pressing.  Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his fi-
         nances could not raise them within full five pounds of the de-
         sired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation,
         he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when,
         passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the
         gate.
            "Wo—o!" said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.
            The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: won-
         dering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with
         a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two
         sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, with-
         out noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.
            Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey
         generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running
         after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevi-
         tably have beaten in any skull but a donkey's.  Then, catch-
         ing hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by
         way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and
         by these means turned him round.  He then gave him another
         blow on the head, just to stun him til he came back again.
         Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the
         gate, to read the bill.
            The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at
         the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered
         hiself of some profound sentiments in the board-room.  Hav-
         ing witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and
         the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up
         to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was
         exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield
         smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was
         just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy
         with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what
         the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a
         nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves.  So,
         he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and
         then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the
         gentleman in the white waistcoat.
            "This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to 'prentis," said
         Mr. Gamfield.
            "Ay, my man," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat,
         with a condescending smile.  "What of him?"
            "If the parish would like him to learn a right pleasant trade,
         in a good 'spectable chimbley-sweepin' bisness," said Mr.
         Gamfield, "I wants a 'prentis, and I am ready to take him."
            "Walk in," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr.
         Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another
         blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a cau-
         tion not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman
         with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first
         seen him.
            "It's a nasty trade," said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield
         had again stated his wish.
            Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before
         now," said another gentleman.
            "That's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in
         the chimbley to make 'em come down again," said Gam-
         field; "that's all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain't o'
         no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds
         him to sleep, and that's wot he likes.  Boys is wery obstinit,
         and wery lazy, gen'l'men, and there's nothink like a good
         hot blaze to make 'em come down vith a run.  It's humane
         too, gen'l'men, acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbley,
         roasting their feet makes 'em struggle to hextricate their-
         selves."
            The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much
         amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily
         checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins.  The board then pro-
         ceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but
         in so low a tone, that the words "saving of expenditure,"
         "looked well in the accounts," "have a printed report pub-
         lished," were alone audible.  These only chanced to be heard,
         indeed, on account of their being very frequently repeated
         with great emphasis.
            At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the
         board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr.
         Limbkins said:
            "We have considered your proposition, and we don't ap-
         prove of it."
            "Not at all," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
            "Decidedly not," added the other members.
            As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight
         imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death al-
         redy, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some
         unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extrane-
         ous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings.  It was
         very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had;
         but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour,
         he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the
         table.
            "So you won't let me have him, gen'l'men?" said Mr. Gam-
         field, pausing near the door.
            "No," replied Mr. Limbkins; "at least, as it's a nasty busi-
         ness, we think you ought to take something less than the pre-
         mium we offered."
            Mr. Gamfield's countenance brightened, as, with a quick
         step, he returned to the table, and said,
            "What'll you give, gen'l'men?  Come!  Don't be too hard on
         a poor man.  What'll you give?"
            "I should say, three pounds ten was plenty," said Mr. Limb-
         kins.
            "Ten shillings too much," said the gentleman in the white
         waistcoat.
            "Come!" said Gamfield; "say four pound, gen'l'men.  Say
         four pound, and you've got rid of him good and all.
         There!"
            "Three pound ten," repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.
            "Come!  I'll split the difference, gen'l'men," urged Gam-
         field.  "Three pound fifteen."
            "Not a farthing more," was the firm reply of Mr. Limb-
         kins.
            "You're desperate hard upon me, gen'l'men," said Gam-
         field, wavering.
            "Pooh! pooh! nonsense!" said the gentleman in the white
         waistcoat.  "He'd be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium.
         Take him, you silly fellow!  He's just the boy for you.  He
         wants the stick, ow and then: it'll do him good; and his
         board needn't come very expensive, for he hasn't been over-
         fed since he was born.  Ha! ha! ha!"
            Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the
         table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke
         into a smile himself.  The bargain was made.  Mr. Bumble was
         at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were
         to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and ap-
         proval, that very afternoon.
            In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his ex-
         cessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and or-
         dered to put himself into a clean shirt.  He had hardly achieved
         this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble
         brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the
         holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread.  At
         this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:
         thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have deter-
         mined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never
         would have begun to fatten him up in that way.
            "Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and
         be thankful," said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pom-
         posity.  "You're going to be made a 'prentis of, Oliver."
            "A 'prentis, sir!" said the child, trembling.
            "Yes, Oliver," said Mr. Bumble.  "The kind and blessed
         gentlemen which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when
         you have none of your own: are going to 'prentice you: and
         to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the
         expense to the parish is three pound ten! — three pound ten,
         Oliver! — seventy shillins — one hundred and forty sixpences! —
         and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love."
            As Mr. Bumble paused to take a breath, after delivering
         this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor
         child's face, and he sobbed bitterly.
            "Come," said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for
         it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his elo-
         quence had produced; "Come, Oliver!  Wipe your eyes with
         the cuffs of your jacket, and don't cry into your gruel; that's
         a very foolish action, Oliver."  It certainly was, for there was
         quite enough water in it already.
            On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed
         Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very
         happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted
         to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed;
         both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather
         as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in
         either particular, there was no telling what would be done to
         him.  When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a
         little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to
         stay there, until he came back to fetch him.
            There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half
         an hour.  At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust
         in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud:
            "Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman."  As Mr.
         Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look,
         and added, in a low voice, "Mind what I told you, you young
         rascal!"
            Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this some-
         what contradictory style of address; but that gentleman pre-
         vented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at
         once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open.  It
         was a large room, with a great window.  Behind a desk, sat
         two old gentlemen with powdered heads: one of whom was
         reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with
         the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of
         parchment which lay before him.  Mr. Limbkins was standing
         in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a
         partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-
         looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about.
            The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off,
         over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause,
         after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of
         the desk.
            This is the boy, your worship," said Mr Bumble.
            The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised
         his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman
         by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentle-
         man woke up.
            "Oh, is this the boy?" said the old gentleman.
            "This is him, sir," replied Mr. Bumble.  "Bow to the mag-
         istrate, my dear."
            Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.  He
         had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates'
         powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff
         on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that
         account.
            "Well," said the old gentleman, "I suppose he's fond of
         chimney-sweeping?"
            "He doats on it, your worship," replied Bumble; giving
         Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say
         he didn't.
            "And he will be a sweep, will he?" inquired the old gen-
         tleman.
            "If we was to blind him to any other trade to-morrow, he'd
         run away simultaneous, your worship," replied Bumble.
            "And this man that's to be his master — you, sir — you'll treat
         him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will
         you?" said the old gentleman.
            "When I says I will, I means I will," replied Mr. Gamfield
         doggedly.
            You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an hon-
         est, open-hearted man," said the old gentleman; turning his
         spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver's pre-
         mium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped
         receipt for cruelty.  But the magistrate was half blind and
         half childish, so he couldn't reasonably be expected to discern
         what other people did.
            "I hope I am, sir," said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.
            "I have no doubt you are, my friend," replied the old
         gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on h is nose, and
         looking about him for the inkstand.
            It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate.  If the inkstand
         had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would
         have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and
         Oliver would have been straightaway hurried off.  But, as it
         chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a
         matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, with-
         out finding it; and happened in the course of his search to
         look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and
         terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all admoni-
         tory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive
         countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression
         of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a
         half-blind magistrate.
            The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked
         from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff
         with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect.
            "My boy!" said the old gentleman, leaning over the desk.
         Oliver started at the sound.  He might be excused for doing
         so: for the words were kindly said; and strange sounds
         frighten one.  He trembled violently, and burst into tears.
            "My boy!" said the old gentleman, "you look pale and
         alarmed.  What is the matter?"
            "Stand a little away from him, Beadle," said the other
         magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with
         an expression of interest.  "Now, boy, tell us what's the mat-
         ter: don't be afraid."
            Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together,
         prayed that they would order him back to the dark room —
         that they would starve him — beat him — kill him if they pleased
         — rather than send him away with that dreadful man.
            "Well!" said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with
         most impressive solemnity.  "Well! of all the artful and de-
         signing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the
         most bare-facedest."
            "Hold your tongue, Beadle," said the second old gentle-
         man, when Mr. Bumble had give vent to this compound
         adjective.
            "I beg your worship's pardon," said Mr. Bumble, incredu-
         lous of his having heard aright.  "Did your worship speak to
         me?"
            "Yes.  Hold your tongue."
            Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.  A beadle
         ordered to hold his tongue!  A moral revolution!
            The ld gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked
         at his companion, he nodded significantly.
            "We refuse to sanction these indentures," said the old gen-
         tleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.
            "I hope," stammered Mr. Limbkins: "I hope the magis-
         trates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been
         guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testi-
         mony of a mere child."
            "The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any
         opinion on the matter," said the second old gentleman sharp-
         ly.  "Take the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him
         kindly.  He seems to want it."
            That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat
         most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver
         would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered
         into the bargain.  Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy
         mystery, and said he wished he might come o good; where-
         unto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to
         him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most mat-
         ters, would seem to be a wish of totally opposite description.
            The next morning, the public were once more informed
         that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds
         would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him.

He wants to leave in the summer and would eb a fantastic asset to our side, creative fantastic shot and free kick, and would bring lots of money into the club through his far east appeal &lt;br /&gt;
이번 여름에 떠나고 싶어해요. 우리편에 훌륭한 자산이 될거에요. 창조적인 슛과 프리킥, 동아시아에 어필할 수 있어서 클럽에 엄청난 돈이 굴러 들어올 겁니다. &lt;br /&gt;

He may be a good aquisition, but don't you think that NUFC should be spending its money on a good defence and a good striker in the summer. His wages could be of better use elsewhere - no offence &lt;br /&gt;
좋은 영입이 될 수도 있겠지만, 뉴캐슬은 수비수와 스트라이커를 영입하는데 돈을 써야 한다고 생각지 않아?? 찾아보면 더 많은 봉급을 줄 수 있는 팀이 있을거야-태클 사양- &lt;br /&gt;

Being Japan's best player doesn't say much. Anyone remember that Shinji Ono was supposed to be the greatest player ever to come from Japan? &lt;br /&gt;
일본 최고의 선수라고 어떤 것도 보장해 주지는 않아. 오노신지가 일본에서 제일 잘하는 선수 아니였어? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(영국인들은 UEFA컵에서 활약했던 오노는 안다.세리에A에서 아무것도못한 나카무라는 모른다.) &lt;br /&gt;

Nakamura is decent but we don't need: &lt;br /&gt;
1.Any more midfielders &lt;br /&gt;
2.Nakamura - he simply isn't good enough. &lt;br /&gt;
나카무라는 좋은 선수기는 하지만 우리에게는 필요없다. &lt;br /&gt;
1. 우린 미드필더 더이상 필요없어. &lt;br /&gt;
2. 나카무라-그는 그저 우리팀에서 뛰기에 실력이 충분치 않아. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ono is better and would be more of an assest, as he can play anyware across the midfield and also can play right back. &lt;br /&gt;
오노가 더 낫다. 도움이 될거야. 미드필드나 라이트백으로 뛸 수 있으니까. &lt;br /&gt;

ono is crap now mate has anyone got a video of nakamura to show these prunes how class he is? &lt;br /&gt;
지금 오노는 허접 쓰레기. 나카무라 동영상을 보지 않은거야? 얼마나 수준 높은 경기력을 보여주는데... &lt;br /&gt;
(이 일본인은 엄청난 나카무라 팬??오노를 깎아내리면서까지..) &lt;br /&gt;

is he the kid who was at Reggina or Reggiana then went to Celtic? &lt;br /&gt;
if he is how can u say he is magic?? &lt;br /&gt;
레지나? 레지아나? 라는 팀에서 셀틱으로 이적해 온 녀석 맞지? &lt;br /&gt;
그럴지라도 너는 어떻게 이 녀석을 매직이라고 부를 수 있냐? &lt;br /&gt;

Don't make a fool of yourself. I could make a video of myself banging in some corkers in the park, but it doesn't mean I'm good enough to play for the Toon. &lt;br /&gt;
Pick the worst player in the Prem and he could look like a star with appropriate editing - try not to rely so much on Google video when judging players. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
바보처럼 굴지 말아라. 우리 동네에서 내가 축구공 차는 이런 비디오, 나도 만들 수 있겠다. 그렇다고 내가 뉴캐슬 선수가 되기에 충분하다는 의미는 아니거든... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
프리미어리그에서 가장 못하는 선수 한명만 골라봐. 적당히 편집한 영상으로 슈퍼스타처럼 보이게 만들 수도 있지. 어떤 선수를 판단할 때는 구글 비디오에 올려진 영상으로 판단하지 않는게 좋아. &lt;br /&gt;

"Antony Lamont"/Gilbert Sorrentino - O'Mara of no fixed abode Collected in In the Wake of the Wake, edited by  David Hayman and Elliott Anderson (University of Wisconsin Press, 1978). This is a standalone excerpt from Sorrentino's Mulligan Stew (Dalkey Archive Press, 1996), presented as a story by the hapless Lamont, proudly enclosed in a letter to a professor who is thinking of using his work in a literature course:

&gt; What, then, did he like, what were the things we were able to ascertain about him from a perusal of his private papers and diaries, his letters and journals, his casual remarks to acquaintances and friends, lovers and wives, over this forty-year period of his life, his “richest years,” spanning almost half a century, from 1915 to 1955, the sad year of his mysterious disappearance?
&gt;
&gt; He may have liked many other things, but we know for certain only that he liked a sweet summer breeze, stars shining softly above, memories (made of This), his mother’s rosary and her posary, an old-fashioned melody, broken hearts, baby shoes, a garden of love just made for two, moments passing into hours, pretty hubba-hubba babies, the roses of Picardy, the moment when the band started playing, a little home for two, gleaming candlelight, beautiful Alsace-Lorraine, heavens above, and smiles that make you happy.
&gt;
&gt; He clapped his fat and sweaty hands together anent the place where the morning glories grow, beautiful Ohio, that dear little boy of his, Hindustan the Man, the end of the rainbow, a baby’s prayer at twilight, getting it up in the morning, Marie, Rose of No Man’s Land, that wunnaful mudder of his, an Alice blue gown, Daddy Long Legs, sweet Dardanella—the Amherst nightingale, dreams that fade and die, Indian summer, letting the rest (sic) of the world go by, a little gift of roses, that mammy o’ his, his isle of golden dreams, Peggy, a pretty girl who was like a felony, Rose of Washington Square, first seeing “her” on the village green, that naughty f--g waltz, and the whip-poor-will.
&gt;
&gt; He was also partial to Avalon, bright eyes, apple-blossom time (saucy days!), the silver lining, a love nest and Mary Palesteena, when his baby smiled at him and when Buddha just simply smiled, a Wild Rose (see Appendix IV), April Showers and her Dapper Dan, Ka-lu-a (who-a?), a phantom kiss, Peggy O’Neill, Sally mit moonlight behind her, a sweet (?) lady, when Frances danced with him, l’amour tou-jours l’amour the “french” way, crinoline-crinkle days, hot wips, a stairway to Paradise, a kiss in the dark, his buddy, trees runnin’ wild, his wonderful one by name o’ Bambalina, a bbabblingg bbrook, and every road that has a turning.
&gt;
&gt; He was wont to have an accident over a girl that mens forget, lingering awhile, being on the mall and swingin’ down the lane, wild flowers, Charley his boy, fascinating rhythm, a June night, his best girl, his dream girl, his Katharina, a lonesome babe lost in the wood, the winks of a angel, a rhapsody in blue, a serenade post-orangeade, tea for two, a love that’s true always, a cuppa coffee (jive Java, Jim!), a sangwich and her, Dinah, drifting and dreaming, a Swiss miss who missed him, sitting on top of the world, and moonlight and roses.
&gt;
&gt; He loved, to crosseyed distraction, the pal of his cradle days, the way to go home, a sleepy-time gal, sweet Georgia Brown, that “certain” feeling, a black bottom (tsk-tsk), blue room, breezin’ (along with the) breeze, Charmaine (the girl friend), to only do the things he might, a lucky day, Mary “Blue” Lou, mountaing grinnery, his dream of the Big Parade!, one alone to be his own, someone to watch over him, a sunny disposish, the red, red robin soi-disant, the Delaware Lackawann’, love that can come to ebberyone, blue skies, Chloe from Swamp City, dew-dew-dewy days, Diana of the Dark Roof, the girl of his dreemz, jost a memory already, a smile as his umbrella (cf. The Grinning Bumbershoot) on a rainy day, being lucky in love hotcha!, him and his shadow (“earmuff weakness”), old man River a.k.a. “Green,” reign, Ramona the “paloma of Pomona,” a Russian lullaby, the melody that lingered on, his “life so glamorous,” a sweet yet moist lollapalooza, and the Carolina moon.
&gt;
&gt; He was busting with a nickel’s worth of ecstasy in re: the glory road, a garden in the rain, honey-diamond bracelets—Woolworth’s doesn’t swell, the sweetheart of all his drims, lilac time, a melody out of the sky, being independently blue, makin’ whoopee with Marie, his lucky star, a (precious little!) thing called love, a morning sunrise. Sonny Boy, sweet Sue, cream in his coffee, not on it!, a Broadway melody, a great day comin’ mañana, a honeysuckle rose, kissing her hand to beat the band, straying a million miles away, a feeling (woo!) he was falling (wow!), Jericho, his sweeter than sweet, Siboney from Bologna, singing in the rain, a malady (Op. 463) that haunted his reverie, springtime in the Rockies, when the organ played at twilight (snickers), a him to her grace, Zigeuner (pronounced “hedge”), something that simply mystified him, all the king’s horses, what was beyond the blue horizon, a lucky moon and a sleepy lagoon wit waves dat wash the pontoon.
&gt;
&gt; You had best believe he went ga-ga bananas when he considered the river of Gulden’s Creams, when his heart grew tipsy in him, happy feet dat did dere stuff!, confessing at O.L.B.E., the Kiss Waltz, moonlight on the Colorado, his ideal, something to remember her buy, eight little letters, walking his baby back home, the waltz she saved for him BUM-bum-bum, the fundamental things of life (cf. “Rocks’ Bottoms” by The Fictitious Collection), looking for the light of a new love, to dream ad nauseam a little dream, a million-dollar baby, Louisa (a wench out o’ wax, sir!), a parade, just one more chance at the Bowl of Cherries (vide “A Minute to Play at Fontbonne Hall!”), the name that she signed, a noo sun in the sky, ooh that kizz!, ev’ry howre sweete as a flowre, soft lights and sweet music (or. Mighty Mazda’s Maudlin Melody), the heaven that must have sent her his way, spending one night with her and her “little” glass of wine, moonlight saving time, taking his sugar to tea, where the blue of the night meets the gold of the day a man ain’t nothin’ but a smoke!, Forty-Second Street, the journey from here to Astar, sweet symbols (by Zildjian!) in the moonlight, a Louisiana hayride with Miz Iberia Pepper, the lullaby of the leaves (see Flagging’s study: “The ‘Jewish’ Novel and Its Uses in Sleep Therapy”), night and day ho, rise and shine hum, shuffling off to (screech!!) Buffalo, as well as the song his heart had to sing.
&gt;
&gt; He found pleasantly diverting (to say the least!) a little tenderness (was he not fletch an bludd?), an old Softee, heaven in his arms, the old ox (read: “cattle”) road, flying—e’en filled with fear—down to Rio, the waterfront, good old mountinn moosick, the likes of her, a paper moon sailing over a cardboard sea (vide D. Philps: “New Thoughts on Lambent Solidity”), lazy bones, his little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii, his moonlight madonna, the Shadow’s Waltz, a sophisticated lady wit fake fingernails, the touch of her hand as well, yesterdays, a glimpse of stocking on a bas bleus gam, the beat of his heart, cocktails for two, the ripples on a stream where disappeared some hatless pipples, hands across the table (and a Buick in her eyes), his idea of nothing to do, his secret heart, June in January (vide “Odd Behavior Indeed” by “Boots” Stekel), love in Bloom as limned by James in his Giant Preach, any cozy little corner, moonglow, funny magic, the object of his affection, one nite of love one!, a field of teagarden white, a sweetie pie, a lovely evening, the one he wasn’t worthy of, two cigarettes in the dark park, the difference a day made, the night and the music, and also cellophane.
&gt;
&gt; How his heart went boom-boom-bammy ‘bout a beautiful lady in blue, Bess, dancing cheek to prancing cheek, a house a showplace, the mood for love, one of those bells that now and then rings, a castle-rising in Spain (viva la muerte!), red sales in the sunset (example of furor scribendi), summertime, top white hat, white fop tie and hot tails, his lucky stah, dancing unduh duh stahs, the chapel in the moonlight, a little old lady (not Maw Green??) passing by, moonlight and shadows. No Regrets by Curt Warner-Goode, pennies from heaven, stumpin’ at the Savoy, waltzing Matilda and the touch of her lips, when his dream boat came home (and his face fell in the chowder), bloo Havaee, the dipsy doodle, harbor lights, the moon in its flight (which few remarked upon), his love to keep him warm, the free, fresh wind in his little buckaroo’s hair, September in the rain, slumming on Park Avenue with sweet Leilani Sue, plus a gold mine in the sky.
&gt;
&gt; He oft experienced a surge of naughty thrills when he thought on a crop of kisses, things that happened for the first time, falling in love with gloves, a pocketful of “dreams,” those peepers, fine finnan haddie or fruity cup or juicy cocktail, a September song, a thwell thip of thparkling Burgundy brew, a beautiful baby, the promised breath of springtime, the oceans’ white (with foam), an eighteenth-century drawing room, the old mill wheel that showed a shapely calf, down México juay, a stairway (hein?) to the stars, all or nothing at all on Blueberry Hill, a cabin (nu?) in the sky, a ferryboat serrynade, the last time he saw Paris (behind a busted chariot), the nearness of her San Antonio rose, hearing those strumpets blow again, and Capistrano and sfogliatelle.
&gt;
&gt; There was a warm spot in his very bowels for the “Chattanooga Choo-Choo Cha-Cha,” Dolores (wotta paira silver things!), New Jork in Yune, the Jersey bounce, a couple of jiggers (wot?) of moonlight, the Saturday dance mit shteamers und beer, the stage-door canteeny-weeny, the blow of the evening, an old familiar score, one dozen roses, a goilish stringa poils, a heart that’s trew, a white Christmas with chestnuts to match, a wing and a prayer (or, “Salvation Army Thanksgiving”), the seam of anyone’s dream, a kiss by a lazy lagoon from a cunnin’ gossoon, the right thing to wear, one “More” for the road, what makes the world go round go bare, coats of navy blue candy, where the West commences (and folks jes’ walk the other way), ron y Cocy-Coly, swinging on a star, an autumn serenade with Injun corn and pumpkinade, cruising down the river (see “Fruits of the Lower Hudson” by Tod Bruce-Tad), the simple life, a queynte (ach! Gott!) caravan, a grand a night for singing, a face in the misty light (one of the few from whom one may learn of Art), what it seemed to be, a well-developed personality that’s one of Nature’s sheer delights, the winds of March that made his heart and all its cockles a dancer, doing whott! came naturally, a doll he could carry, the sun in the mawnin’, a good day for singing el song, a midnight masquerade, and too, a rainy night in the Rio (or comparable fleabag).
&gt;
&gt; His dry old mouth would drool for shoofly pie and apple pan dowdy that could make a person nauseous, the girl he was near, anyone (anywhere) who knows, golden earrings with gypsy wench attached, smokey dreams (from Holman’s store), buttons and bows, faraway places, hair of foo gold, eyes of troo bloo, the rainbow when there was no rain, a lovely bloody bunch of bleedin’ coconuts, mañana bañanas, a slow boat to China, e.g., the S.S. “Rollins,” red roses for a blue lady, Bali Hai in flowerai bra, dear hots and gentle purple, a wish his heart made, the four winds and the seven sees, Hucklebuck Pie with Parker House Rolls, an old-fashioned walk with lissome poon in tow, a mule train, the old master painter sitting by a window, that lucky old sun, A. Bushel and A. Peck: Attorneys at Law, whoop-de-doo songs, the middle of a warm caress, the old piano-roll blues, Sam’s song, viz., “Hello, You Pompous Bushwa Schmuck, Hello!”, Belle, Belle, his Liberty Belle, a talk (uh-huh) to the trees, the cool, cool, ghoul of the evening, a lonely little robin, the loveliest night of the year. Mixed Emotions by O.M. Boston, the morning side of the mountain, his first and his last love, and Shanghai.
&gt;
&gt; Joy unbounded almost knocked his greasy hat off concerning sweet violets, the corner beneath the berry tree, Delicado L’Inconnu, walking to Missouri with Matt, the Wheels of Fortune: Prop.; some Greek, the ebb tide, the wrong face, limelight, a rock around the clock, the second star to the right, wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen to bust out yer beak, the lure of her, the belle of the ball, a girl! a girl!, his kinkdom for a girl!, green years, Hernando’s Hideaway, Honey Babe (a.k.a. “the Blue Box”), the little shoemaker, Paris in the winter when it drizzles in your vin, a loving spree, the mambo Italiano wit’ sweet peppers an’ a liddle erl, his restless lover, Skokiaan where the lingonberry blows ‘neath the midnight sun, steam heet, the barefoot Contessa, Connie Pazze-Cicc’, amore, three coins in the fountain, autumn leaves while others stand and wait, cherry-pink and apple-blossom white with scarlet shower curtain and blush-rose bowl, a many-splendored thing, Pete Kelly’s booze, an irresistible force, a tender trap, and whatever Lola wanted.
&gt;
&gt; Yet, lest we too hastily assume that we may glean from the above a fairly complete picture of this complicated man and his wide-ranging tastes, his constantly changing and growing personality, let us temper this portrait with a recital of those things—and they are many—that he heartily disliked. They including whizzpering treezz, waking up to a rag (so he say!), every light on Broadway, honky-tonk towns, dark clouds waiting, smiling more or less through his tears, eyes that don’t mean what they say, every swell Suzie and sweetie Sal, new-mown hay, Indiana (“Hog-Caller of the World”), drums rum-tumming, smiles that made him blue, the daughter of Rosie O’Grady when she pitched into the punch, chasing rainbowse, K-K-K-Katy Kkootie, paddelin’ Madelon, pretty Mickey, Dixie Melodies (e.g., “My Pickup is Parked Outside Your Heart”), that tumbledown shack in Athlone, the heart of a rose, Chinese lullabies sans starch, his sister Kate, forever blowing Bubbles, Mandy, a one-horse town, how he cried about her, the all pinky-goldy Miami shore, and basement air.
&gt;
&gt; His was a veritable typhoon of loathing o’er Swanee, tulip thyme, when the town went dry, waiting for the same old sunrise, Broadway Rows, the Japanese sandman, that little town in the ould County Down (q.v.), Lindy Lou, Margie the lass so liked by lost lake shore, a pale moon, Tripoli, whispering (which he weally wesented), young men’s fancies (he thought them catamitous), to be all by himself, the flowers that bloom in May, the rose in the devil’s garden (vide “Mephisto’s Late Bloomer” by Fleur Frilly), kittens on the keys, pictures out of books, second-hand Rose, the Sheik of Araby or, “Mr. Profilaksos,” songs of love, three o’clock in the morning, the Wabash Blues (champeens of the Chili League), Carolina in the morning, Chicago, China Boys (see Peking Robots by Wao Ji), dancing fools, Georgia, ladies of the evening adrench in deshabille, the Limehouse Blues, lovin’ Sam (who though broke yet hath his purse entire), the Sheik of Alabam’ who am whut he done am, the South Sea moon, Nellie Thanwhomwhich Kelly, being on the Alamo, Rose of the Rio Grande, a chicana chick, stumbling on the road to Being way down yonder in Nawleens, Annabelle and Barney Google, The Bugle-Call Rag (“All The News From Shit to Hint”), Charleston, Dizzy Fingers, “the nose-flute king,” Raggedy Ann, that old bang of his, being all alone by the telephone the day that Sally went away (cf. “Anomie in Cincinnati” by Ursur Kostelfeder), the Indian love call, someone who could make him feel glad just to be sad (vide Venus Furs’s Further Adventures), memory lane, nobody’s g.d.s.o.b. sweetheart, a prisoner’s song or, “Framed!,” Rose Marie (the veriest spindrift o’ the seaside), sugar caca, a photograph to tell his troubles to, and the Bam, Bam, Bamy shore.
&gt;
&gt; He like to fainted from ennui when entertaining thoughts of Cecilia, gypsy eyes brazen. Rose with the turned-down hose (his partiality was for opera stockings), drinking songs, the hills of home. Jalousie (a.k.a. “La Ventana”), a cottage small by a waterfall where a pall of smoke did plash, when lights were low, the song of the vagabonds courtesy Texas-Pacific RR, Sunny and His Ukulele Lady, Valencia, “Baby” Face, Er.A., the mirth of the blues, hard-luck stories that “they” handed him, desert songs, horses, climbing the highest mountain with determined mien, stars peek-a-booing down, little white houses (vide Bukka Cairo’s study, “ ‘Honky’ Myths in Western Architecture”), when nighttime came stealing, the moonlight on the Ganges that fully floodlights flotsam foul, muddy water, his little nest of heavenly blue (the time it played a trick on him), playingk andt dancingk jeepsies, the Riff song, how when day was done day left, a broken heart among his souvenirs. Bill Crazywords and his crazy tunes, a dancing! tambourine!, a funny face looking over a four-leaf clover, Mississippi mud, his blue heaven, when his heart stood still, Paree (vide “Farm Desertion after 1918,” U.S. Gov’t Printing Office), the rangers’ song, “Rio Rita,” and Sam the old accordion man.
&gt;
&gt; His head was a gourd chock full of dreariness in the contemplation of going along singing a song, the Varsity Drag—known as “the lewd lineman,” Miss Annabelle Lee, his land and their land and kasha for two, pain in his tum-tum and fogg in his brayn, Crazy Rhythm (or, “Drunk Again”), women crazy for him, rain a window-pane and darkness too, a ding-dong daddy and his pornographic prong, a red, red rose, Jeannine the Sweetheart of Racine, the Manhattan Serenade, one kiss o’ shortnin’ bread, stouthearted men, sweethearts on parade (Wacy Women), a rainbow round his shoulder, the sale of his dreamboat and the yegg on his dear, those tears in his eyes, deep night, a talking picture of hers, vagabond lovers or, venereal vagrants, magic spells that were everywhere just a’-moaning low, his sin whispered in crepuscular confessional, the one rouse that was left in his heart, pagan love songs (viz., ugga-boo-clabba-donggoo, etc.), the lonely hours knee-deep in Stardust, wedding bells that go yingle-yingle, that thing called love, a man who ain’t got a friend, a bench in the park, plus Betty Co-Ed.
&gt;
&gt; How his weak and watery eyes did snap in spite when he heard tell of any Russian play, a cheerful little earful, crahn fo de Caahlahns, dancing with tears in his eyes, everything that was fine and dandy plus plum cake and sugar candy, what actually happened in Monterey, the part (thou small! thou meaty!) he was playing, the lazy Lou’siana moun, little white lies, the sunny side of the street, Stein songs (like “Grin With Gin”), time on his hands, two hearts in three-quarter time, the part that once was his heart, the devil and the deep blue sea (see A History of Keels by D.B. Boiler), a Cuban love song (i.e., “Yo Bedder Not Eat Op Dees Fried-Huevo Sangweech”), dancing in the dreck, droms in his hott, heartaches, the only time she hauled his was when they were dancing, the game of “Stay away!” or, “Presbyterian Honeymoon,” a ladee of Espaiñ, French letters in the sand, Minnie the moocher of 8th Street, a mood indigo, the chaynes that bounde him, their old rendezvous (cf. “Tristes”), why darkies were brown, a Wabash moon, sleepy time down Sout’ where statues rule, when the moon came over the mountain and his hat fell into the drink, when Yuba played the rhumba on the tuba, April in Paris (see Stekel, ibid.), a cabin in de cotton, and a shantih in old Shantihtown.
&gt;
&gt; He became physically ill when he thought of a thing that ain’t got swing, every little star, an echo in the valley dat yodels “Dot’s right, Dieter,” little streets where old friends meet Mimi, a hungry yearning burning inside of him, a shine (semper idem) on his shoes, too many tears, the Harlem Moon (in 2 oz. gin float an egg yolk; serve); an old smoothie name o’ Lily of France, Annie who don’t live here no more, the Boulevard of Broken Dreams (vide The South Bronx: Why? by Chas. Manhattan), a dream walking, the Easter Parade, a tropical heat wave as created by “Mr. Jesus,” the valley of the moon, “Ode to A Muslin Tree” by Harry L. Amherst, the talk of the town, the last round-up—when podners chomp their chaps for chuck, the old spinning wheel, orchids in the moonlight sobbing prettily, smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow’s stormy weather, “Two Tickets to Georgia (Where the Pines Decay),” The Big Bad Wolf by D. Walt Vidal, a brue moon, a cattle call (as advtd. in Bean’s), the Continental isle of Capri, a little Dutch mill, his old flame, his (?) shawl, the good ship “Lollipop,” his Sóuthêrn äccent, solitude among tumbling tumbleweeds, as well as the little solitary kinks that everyone ought to do.
&gt;
&gt; He chawed his lips and ground his choppers to dust when a faint memory came to him of wagon wheels stark in a winter wonderland, nights of tropickal splendour lightly touched with scent of rotting cantaloupes, Broadway Rythum in all its vain glory, how you say “revolutions” in Spain, songs coming on, plenty of nuthin’ which all can somehow spare, a little geepyseepy tearoom with a sticky cot in back, the thing that you’re liable to read in the Bible, little white gardenias on her corduroy slip, the lullaby of Broadway (cf. “Rhy-thum”), the moon over Miami’s Piccolino-Hilton, a prairie moon that gleams ‘pon a Latin from Manghattang, the song of the open road, the strings (how oft they broke!) of his heart, empty saddles, “Yesterday’s Mashed Potatoes” by H.H. Bickford, old cowhands putting all their aigs in one basket, what they say (and what they say!) about Dixie, the warning voice that came in the night or, “melody from the sky,” and the shoe shine-boys. Snap and Pop.
&gt;
&gt; How many sick headaches were caused by stars in his eyes, not a sine of people, twilight or whatever on the trail, the Whiffenpoof Song, Bob White (see Biographical Notes), a foggy day in London town—the very day that Willy Sikes faw down, the moon growing dim on the rim of a hill in faraway Tim-buc-too!, Johnny One-Note (née Simon), the moona of Manakoora, the ripe and ravishing Rosalie, the leaves of brown ‘neath shoures sweete, that old filling, a lull in his life, a toy trumpet that hirts the ears, a little yellow basket, cathedrals in the pines bathed in that Hollywood lux, Flat Foot Floogie: NYPD, the park across the bay with the penny serenade, dizzy spells from a julep or two, a summer with a thousand Julys (satis superque!), deep purple old Dutch gardens with the lilacs (ah, the lilacs) in the rain, his prayer that she’d do it the South American way (thighs apart, soles together), a sunrise serenade, half a love (cf. The Geld Twins on Pepperidge Farm), a dolly with a hole in her stocking, his heart above his head (he crawled on his belly like a rep-tile!), the Johnson rag which was inadequate to say the least, a make-believe island, rhum-boogie or, “A Drunken Zulu,” a sleepy lagoon a mirror ruffled gently by the trade winds, an anniversary plotz, a simpering, whimpering child, blues in the night (see Cigarettes, Sawdust), daydreaming flamingoes (dat sudden boist of pink!), moonlight and motor trips, “Chief” Jim Bluebirds, the white cliffs of Dover, the craziest drim, Idaho (Shoshoni for “Chips”), gals in Kalamazoo, bells that jingle jangle jingle jongle, serenades in brew, old “Black Magic” and his “Warsaw Concerto Jump,” some head in the clouds, the river of the roses (for it had only thorns for him), a holiday for strings, and Oklahoma (pronounced Ocjcwczw).
&gt;
&gt; He utterly despised, in spades, his rose and his glove, the San Fernando Valley, a surrey with the fringe on top (vide S. Freud, “Genital Symbolism in the ‘Pop’ Song”), Mr. In-Between, bell-bottom trousers, Rainbowville and its maple-syrup crick, the loneliest night of the weak, sentimental journeys with strange music, the trolley song, “Big” Backyards, the steel-drivin’ fellow, doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs, shadowed boxes in the dark, Laura Foots, what he heard down the hall, a royale affaire, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (the Barcelonas of the West), a cigarette that bares lipstick traces, Sioux City Sue (the poetess pro forma), the end of time while waiting for the train to come in, Chiquita Banana, a señorita of the oddest tastes, a fool moon and empty arms, a gal in Calico, U.S.S. “Glocca Morra,” Linda O. Devilmoon (the old lamplighter), a Sunday kind of love, the old buttermilk sky that made his tummie sickie wickie, Wyoming ballerinas feuding and fighting, ivy, Stanley Steamer (late of Lundy’s), trees in the meadow, strange-sounding names (e.g., Mungii, Elmowrk, Pradshitte, etc.), a fella with an umbrella, Haunted Hearts or, Terror in the Finished Basement, a most unusual day, nature boys amid the sunflowers, careless hands that messed his meerschaum. Coppers’ Canyon, dreamers’ holidays, happy tawk, the Hopscotch Polka which always ends in tears, hot canaries (they wuz tweet), the Mona Lisa, riders in the sky, Rudolph (yet another Kraut who loathed the Führer!), a stranger, hand trailing in the punch, across a crowded room, Candy and Cake (the friendly Dobermans who ate old ladies in Larchmont), Christmas in Killarney, a man around a house, muzik! muzick! muzikk!, an orange-colored Skye (a ugly cur), Our Lady of Fatima who did not bring him a bike, sleigh rides, “Sunshine” Cake (née Wilhelmina Boutonniere), crazy hearts, Elisa, a kiss to build a dream on a marshmallow moon, Misto Cristofo Columbo (cf. O. Oglio’s “Remember When Oil Ran Out?”), Mockingbird Hill with the sparrows in the treetops, the blue tangoo, high noon, and one Mr. Callaghan.
&gt;
&gt; Vitriolic delirium shook his frame upon being reminded of one little candle in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Thumbelina of the Foul Fingers, April in Portugal, the “doggie” in the window (see Hamburg, Entertainment in), yust anodder polka, watching the night go by. Ruby Baubles, Ruby Bangles, and Ruby Beads, a blue mirage, Fanny and the finger of suspicion, Hajji Baba (the “High and the Mighty One”), being home for the holidays, a woman’s world as fer as cercled is the mapemounde, the Jones boy fresh out of Beth Israel, little things that mean a lot (few could name three and whistle), Mister Sandman (“the man that got aweigh”), the naughty lady of Shady Lane who did odd things in her arbor, whoever stole the wedding bell, the typewriters and Adelaide, a sighing blue star, Mr. Banjo when he shaked his bones fo de peepul, love and marriage, the man from Laramie (the galoot who could say “yes” and “no”), strange ladies in town, an unchained melody, and, last but not least, “Yellow” Rose of Texas, who had an arrangement with a certain Capt. Copro, U.S.A.F.

I [16F] finally told my friend [17M] how I felt I used to be painfully shy when I was younger. I got mocked constantly for my weird hair and I never really found the courage to talk to people and make friends. I was in 5th grade when I met my friend who we'll call D. We were both in a film-making club and we spent a lot of time together working on a project. I found out we shared a lot of interests and I finally came out of my shell and talked to someone. I joined the Photography club just because he was in it even though I suck ass at photography. He would come sit with me at lunch and in our club meetings and talk to me because I guess he realised how lonely and hopeless I was. I was infatuated. For the first time in my life, someone actually wanted to talk to me and didn't see me as invisible.  I knew I'd never be able to work up the courage to tell him so I pushed any feelings I had deep deep down.

 Come 8th grade, I found out he liked this other girl. She was gorgeous, confident, amazing, everything I wasn't. I never understood why he liked her though. She was really mean and horrible to everyone, which was in stark contrast with how caring and kind D was. But I accepted it and tried my hardest to move on. I screwed up somewhere along the way and basically had a meltdown because I had to see them together all the time. I told D it was because all he ever did was talk about her but it was really because I couldn't take it anymore. D and I didn't talk to each for 4 or 5 months after that. I realised, not soon enough, how petty and obnoxious I was being and apologised to him. He forgave me and we were great friends again. This was the time around which I realised just how intense my feelings were for him. It physically hurt me not to talk to him during those 4 months. I know this all sounds really dramatic but I promise, I'm not exaggerating one bit. It just kept getting worse because he'd do things that would just make me fall for him even harder. This one time, in freshman year, we were talking in the hallway and this kid made a snide comment about me. He told the kid off for 5 minutes and didn't stop until I shouted at him to. I'd grown used to people making fun of me but anyone out there with shitty self-esteem knows how nice it feels when someone else stands up for you.

Fast forward to freshman year, he told me he had to transfer schools next year. I cried so much that day at home. We promised to stay in touch but we never really did. I tried my hardest to get over him after he left but I texted him out of the blue last year and we talked for 3 hours. He told me he hadn't talked to anyone from our old school ever since he left.  I'd convinced myself that I was over him by this time but god was I wrong. I was in love with this guy and that wasn't changing anytime soon. We've texted at least once every month after that (we're both really busy with school and other things) and last month I finally told him I used to like him. He teased me about it taking me long enough to speak up. He said he'd never expected that, especially from me \[In hindsight, I'm to blame here, I was very vocally a high-school-relationships-are-stupid person. Ironic, right?\]. I asked him why and he said, "I don't know. You were just... you - the smart girl." lmao wot? What does that have to do with anything? Of course, I didn't ask him that because I was scared things would get awkward. At the end of our conversation, he asked me if I wanted to meet up sometime. I panicked and told him no. When he asked why, I told him it was because it took me a long time to get over him and I wasn't planning on repeating that. Pretty mature AND STUPID of me. Truth was, I was scared shitless at the idea of seeing him again because I knew it would be really painful having to relive through all those memories.

We were talking again tonight and he asked me again if I wanted to meet up before he leaves for college and I completely froze and told him my parents would kill me and kinda brushed it off as a joke. I really want to go see him but I'm scared of what will happen. Also my parents really will be weirded out by the idea of me meeting a boy. What do you think I should do? Should I go see him? What if everything blows up and I ruin the delicate equilibrium we've finally reached?

Sorry about the long wall of text. I know no one's interested in the relationship drama, or lack thereof, of a teenager butI was hoping I could get some advice on what to do.

Do I have a boost leak? I have a 2013 Sti, ran an accessport datalog doing WOT pulls in 2nd and 3rd gear to 6k rpm. The log said peak boost was 13psi. The tune is for 18.5psi. It's 34 degrees out. Does this sound like it could be a boost leak or is it making lower boost due to the cold weather? I bought the car off someone recently so I haven't had a chance to drive it in warmer weather yet.

How to stop attracting trouble? If that's even what's happening? I'll try to keep it concise.

I was raised in a ghetto neighborhood. I haven't really ever experienced any of these problems back then. Guess my parents were good at preventing and sheltering me from these things. Now I work as a sales rep in a not so good area. Pay is very good. The customers that come in? Not so much. I get plenty of compliments and complaints from them but they are  personal and not related to work.

Women will tell me I'm extremely attractive. Some try to sleep with me and some tell me I'm handsome but I'm not very nice. (Obviously not every girl that is a customer will bring up this but a lot of them do) (I don't see why it's necessary for them to come in and judge me either)
Men will almost always give me some kind of dirty look. Sometimes I feel like it's because of the attention the girls give me in front of them. Other times I'm told it's because I walk around super confident or even cocky.

Here's the problem: my entire life I struggled with self confidence issues and anxiety. I finally feel like I'm at a place where I'm happy with myself. But apparently that gives people different vibes. If I look at them, I'm giving them a dirty look. If I laugh, it's a cocky smirk. If I'm on my phone sitting comfortably in a chair, I think I'm all that and a bag of chips. I'm just sick of it.

Today and at least once a week, some guy tries to fight me. The guy from today was arguing with a co-worker and I didn't say a word to him. Turned to me called me a fuck boy, flicked me off, and said step outside so he could beat my ass. I've been in a few brawls but when I was much younger. I currently stand at ~ 6'1 and about 185lbs, and I frequently hit the gym. That guy was about 5'6 and like 120lbs. (My coworker is his size so it doesn't make sense to pick a fight with me) I know I could've taken him but I just don't want any trouble so I just laughed off his threats. Which he obviously didn't like. This type of stuff is bringing back my anxiety and taking shots at my ego.

Here's my question: what can I do to stop attracting that attention? I did nothing wrong and my face is my face. Sometimes I wish I do step outside for an ego boost but what would that outcome be? I'm almost certain they're just trying to act tough and get into my head. Any advice to control anxiety in those situations?


TL;DR: Had really bad anxiety. Overcame it and have good self-esteem. People seem to mistaken my confidence at least in ghetto areas and want to fight me. Fight or flight increases adrenaline therefore makes me anxious. Wot do

shout out to Will @ Purple Drank I've tuned with Freek, Dizzy, and Rob. They've all been great to me, and answered almost any question I've had. I tuned with Freek and Rob on various K04 setups and didn't really know much about tuning. I could read logs and see the tune was safe, but I didn't know much about how to get it there.

Then I upgraded to CS turbo and thought about self tuning. Read some guides, took Cobb's stupid class, got ATR, talked to some people, but decided against it. I didn't have time with school and my previous log spot was rendered useless.

So at that point, I knew a lot more about the tuning process but didn't have time to try and self tune. I didn't quite understand doing a maf cal and I just wanted a driveable car that made power safely in a reasonable time frame. Naturally I had a lot more questions than before, and was also a lot more nervous being on a larger turbo. Jason was great, explained everything. I'd ask questions like how are you determining boost vs timing which seemed like a tuner secret. But he had no issue explaining. I have no idea if Justin or Rob would have answered the same as Jason. I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt and say they would have as well.

I've never tuned with Will. No particular reason why, never disliked him/always liked him. Recently he's been doing videos on facebook recently in the group mazdaspeed 3 owners. It's become almost a weekly thing and he will hit on different topics. Anything from how hot side sizing works and translates to real world, running through what common issues can be, and how to diagnose them, going through what hardware mods you need to hit your power goal, etc. These were pretty cool but I feel like he knocked it out of the park tonight. To a lot of you that don't self tune, never have, some of this may be over your head but it's worth a read.

He basically walked through 80-90% of what a custom tune is in ATR after doing a maf cal (still haven't found a great video on that. Phate has done a part 1 but never part 2, if anyone has any other good maf cal videos please share). Anyway, Will showed how to touch up fueling at WOT using the maf cal table and pretty much how to build a wastegate duty cycle table from scratch (he 0'd out the table and showed how to build a sensible map). I already knew basics of adjusting wg duty cycle to hit boost or load targets, but if I was self tuning he just saved me 10 revisions and hours of tuning. I had no idea what to do to the wg tables for partial throttle. If on the K04 with the stock ebcs, I'd just keep the cobb tables for accel position &lt;50%... But on a bigger turbo I wouldn't do that, and would rather start from scratch. He showed the math exactly how he'd do it. I'm not sure if it translates 100%, but I suppose it makes sense if you have a 14 psi wg spring, a 25% duty cycle would get you 25% more boost (~17.5 psi). Obviously there will be trial and error, and it may not work out like that. I think the real point was there should still be some sort of relationship between wg duty and actual boost that is achieved (assuming the turbo isn't creeping and there are no mechanical issues). And you can extrapolate that relationship after adding some duty cycle and getting a solid curve. and once you get a wot boost curve (or load if you load tune) where it should be, he gave the information on how build an entire table around that for all throttle positions.

I also knew if the car wasn't hitting afr targets and there were no mechanical issues, the answer wasn't to adjust the afr target. I knew to adjust the maf cal. He showed the math and once again the math makes sense. If you target an 11.5 and are hitting 12.0, you're ~4% off. So adjust your maf cal 4% in that area. But he also showed what some people get wrong, and how to blend the maf cal into the other breakpoints.

all in all I thought it was really cool a pro tuner took time to film a video on those topics in ATR.

And on top of that I have 4 friends who tuned with him, and only have positive things to say. two were big power PI guys, one was a CS turbo stock block, one was a K04. I think they were even able to call him to troubleshoot issues.

So with the tune, after you get boost and fuel down, you're kind of left with safeguards. Where do you want the car to cut for over boost, going over load, how much do you want the car to correct wg duty if it's going over or under boost/load (which it can depending on weather), boost by gear, etc.

But honestly in his 20 minute video I feel I learned more than taking Cobb's entire class. So props to him for doing this little service each week

My dream showed me my sister's phone password...wot Okay so a little bit of background...

My sister is the most private person when it comes to personal belongings. Whether it's her laptop, phone or emails, no one knows her passwords AT ALL! She doesn't share, and when she types it out with people around, she expects everyone to look away while she covertly types away.

I always respect her wishes. I look away and busy myself with work while she unlocks whatever I need.

Today, I had a dream where I was holding her phone and decided to unlock it. The first numbers which popped into mind were 3551 \*her password has since changed LOL\*, I typed it in and BAM! Unlocked. It was a weird and short dream, but as I was getting up for work I thought it'd be funny to try it out. And what do you know...it unlocked. I thought I was still dreaming, it was INSANE!

I don't know why those numbers stuck out to me, perhaps my subconscious has picked up on something that I wasn't aware of? Or maybe my brain is a sleeping-hacker? HAHA. But in all seriousness, I thought that was pretty cool...now to dream up some lotto numbers and win big!

Has anyone dreamt something which turned out to be unexpectedly real?

Cherokee xj 1998 4.0L no start issue Hello all, I've got some issues going on with my xj, the first symptom was that when driving usually at highway speeds it would randomly cut out for a split second and then keep running,  sounded like maybe a detonation with a thunk sound, it also would occasionally have an issue where it either would flood when trying to start (could smell the gas, let sit for a while and would start with WOT), sometimes would have a real rough idle but after driving a few minutes cleared up.

This went on for a few weeks, then on a long trip back from the city i was going about 70 and it just revved down and stopped running in the middle of the highway, got it to momentarily start to get over to shoulder and hasn't been able to start since, just cranks, has spark and fuel, and tried starting fluid to double check it was getting fuel.

Any suggestions on what to check next would be greatly appreciated.

How to stop attracting trouble? It's causing me anxiety? I'll try to keep it concise.

I was raised in a ghetto neighborhood. I haven't really ever experienced any of these problems back then. Guess my parents were good at preventing and sheltering me from these things. Now I work as a sales rep in a not so good area. Pay is very good. The customers that come in? Not so much. I get plenty of compliments and complaints from them but they are  personal and not related to work.

Women will tell me I'm extremely attractive. Some try to sleep with me and some tell me I'm handsome but I'm not very nice. (Obviously not every girl that is a customer will bring up this but a lot of them do) (I don't see why it's necessary for them to come in and judge me either)
Men will almost always give me some kind of dirty look. Sometimes I feel like it's because of the attention the girls give me in front of them. Other times I'm told it's because I walk around super confident or even cocky.

Here's the problem: my entire life I struggled with self confidence issues and anxiety. I finally feel like I'm at a place where I'm happy with myself. But apparently that gives people different vibes. If I look at them, I'm giving them a dirty look. If I laugh, it's a cocky smirk. If I'm on my phone sitting comfortably in a chair, I think I'm all that and a bag of chips. I'm just sick of it.

Today and at least once a week, some guy tries to fight me. The guy from today was arguing with a co-worker and I didn't say a word to him. Turned to me called me a fuck boy, flicked me off, and said step outside so he could beat my ass. I've been in a few brawls but when I was much younger. I currently stand at ~ 6'1 and about 185lbs, and I frequently hit the gym. That guy was about 5'6 and like 120lbs. (My coworker is his size so it doesn't make sense to pick a fight with me) I know I could've taken him but I just don't want any trouble so I just laughed off his threats. Which he obviously didn't like. This type of stuff is bringing back my anxiety and taking shots at my ego.

Here's my question: what can I do to stop attracting that attention? I did nothing wrong and my face is my face. Sometimes I wish I do step outside for an ego boost but what would that outcome be? I'm almost certain they're just trying to act tough and get into my head. Any advice to control anxiety in those situations?


TL;DR: Had really bad anxiety. Overcame it and have good self-esteem. People seem to mistaken my confidence at least in ghetto areas and want to fight me. Fight or flight increases adrenaline therefore makes me anxious. Wot do

&gt;Be still me Jim the paladin

&gt;Party decides we need a base

&gt;Isn't a boat good enough?

&gt;Apparently not, we head off towards the thunder-plains

&gt;I kinda zoned out again... only some much insanity you can understand in one day

&gt;Did get paid to polish Momonga's growing weapon horde so that's a bonus

&gt;The others begin duelling and Ulbert tries to fish... with little success

&gt;Meanwhile murder bird has something to do "real life responsibilities" or some variation on that spell

****
****
**Krogg**

****

&gt;Be me Krogg, the 'andsomest and smartestest of all the orcs

&gt;'Cept boss of course

&gt;Get told to guard bridge and "tax" the 'umies dat sail down da river

&gt;Fair 'nough, BUT THERE NO 'UMINES

&gt;Me and Da bois 'ave been sittin' here for weeks

&gt;Not a single 'umie to kill

&gt;AN' TA MAKE IT WORSE WE OUTA BOOZE

&gt;'Owever wez spot a ship commin' our way

&gt;'UMIE KILLIN TIME!!

&gt;Jump down onto da boat when it close 'nough

&gt;No 'umies... wot

&gt;Goat?...Crocadile... man in armour

&gt;He 'umie? no he no smell like one

&gt;Dere be 'umie but not here

&gt;I been told to tax da 'umies but non-'umies? I dunno

&gt;Croc offers me shiny for work with him

&gt;Takes a while but I manage to count out the coin

&gt;TEN?! only ten! dat's barely bigger than SIX!

&gt;'Owever he says we get more latter

&gt;Hmmm... Sure if he gives me a hat

&gt;Boss 'ave hat, I want hat

&gt;Dey agree and i go back and get ma bois

&gt;Beats stayin' on dis stinking bridge

&gt;One boi starts to argue, says we need to stay on da bridge

&gt;Throw 'im in the water, No argue with boss... who is me

****
****
**Jim**

****

&gt;We appear to have acquired some.. friends?

&gt;They claim they are Momonga's "bois" now... whatever that means

&gt;I do talk to them a fair amount and they seem okay... if not entirely sane

&gt;We approach a town after some time and decide to split the group

&gt;Me and touch me will go into town as he passes as human and I am human

&gt;The rest will hunt in the surrounding woods and we shall meet up downstream

&gt;Momonga gives me some gold and asks me to make sure I get a hat and and alcohol

&gt;I understand the need for alcohol... but why the hat?

&gt;You know what I know better than to ask

&gt;The buying of supplies goes fairly smoothly as does repairing the damaged plate we salvaged from the war-chief

&gt;We finish it off by buying some weird stuff form a travelling merchant, some special booze (because we needed more apparently) a salve and a wand

&gt;While the thought of running does occur to me... it would probably be a terrible idea

&gt;We load the supplies onto the boat while we wait for the armour to be resized and then set sail from the rendezvous point

****
****
**Krogg**

****

&gt;Krogg know one thing, and dat 'ow to kill

&gt;Take ma bois to hunt some food

&gt;No 'umies tho, Skele boi say so

&gt;Also dey tell me their names but they too long to remember

&gt;So they called, goat man, bone man, shiny man and Jim

&gt;Jim short enough to remember

&gt;Da bone man say Jim kill many of my kind

&gt;Dis scrawny thing?! Maybe my eyes aren't working

&gt;ANYWAY so ma bois do good 'unting shit

&gt;I 'ear some fuck yell bout nat 20

&gt;Wotz dat?

&gt;I... admittedly get lost

&gt;Get attacked by a bear

&gt;Dat's not good

&gt;Bear friend, I 'ad bear friend as little orc

&gt;Maybe hug will make it stop

&gt;It no stop

&gt;Hug more?

&gt;Turns out bear weaker than I remember, bear neck snap

&gt;... Oh well make nice hat

&gt;Return to the boat with everyone else


****
****
**Jim**

****

&gt;For some reason everyone decided to start drinking almost without conversation

&gt;Momonga gives touch me some mushrooms

&gt;I still shudder every-time I see touch me's face

&gt;Touch me starts to act.. strange... in his own words "high as fuck"

&gt;Ulbert passes out immediately after tasting some of the special wine we bought

&gt;Momonga seems to also start acting strange after applying some of the salve we bought

&gt;After dropping them repeatedly Ulbert and touch me do manage to get the unconscious goat into his quarters

&gt;Monomga also throws Ulbert's sleeping familiar at touch me

&gt;I decide that it would be a good thing if Ulbert doesn't remember anything from this night

&gt;Momonga offers me a second mushroom... I decline as I have seen what it did to touch me

&gt;Touch me then decides to eat the second mushroom getting even more high

&gt;This continued for roughly a week before fading

&gt;I don't remember much more from the night ... perhaps fortunately

****
****
**Krogg**

****

&gt;Now dis is a gud time

&gt;Drink, bois, Shiny boi falling flat on 'is face, what more could an orc want!

&gt;Blood!, dat's what an orc could want!

&gt;'Owever the boatman scares me, an' gettin' blood on his boat would piss 'im off

&gt;Owever I still want a competition

&gt;I know! a test of strength!

&gt;So I'z arm wrestle all ma bois, but I ain't the boss for nothing so I win easy

&gt;I know! I'll get the shiny boi and bone boi involved, an I guess Jim as well, cus I wanna see if he really strong

&gt;I lose to shiny boi

&gt;Even though I'm pretty sure shiny man cannot stand up properly

&gt;Jim lose to bone boi

&gt;Is a close fight, but bone boi win, possibly due to shiny boi being high

&gt;I give bear pelt to bone boi

&gt;We then end the night with more drinking and fun


****
****
**Jim**

****

&gt;After about 4 days we reach the shores of the thunder plains

&gt;Touch me is still high as fuck

&gt;Momonga attempts to feed him alcohol to sober him up

&gt;It of course...didn't work

&gt;We make camp and wait out touch me's high before moving on to fight something

&gt;The talked about something about a dragon, a spear... something about chains

&gt;It honestly doesn't make much sense to me

&gt;But we do track down this beast a twisted hybrid of man and beast that calls down thunder

&gt;All in all... not that scary compared to my "team mates"

&gt;We surround him and honestly beat the shit out of him

&gt;I get launched off a cliff and Touch me gets stuck by lightning but honestly it did less than i thought

&gt;Plus he couldn't really hurt any of us or get to the warlock... who honestly didn't hit him more than twice during the fight

&gt;Eventually it attempts to run

&gt;Everyone else misses with both their attack of opportunity and their attempt to kill it before it flees but I Launch my spear at it's retreating head and nail it right in the back of the head downing it

&gt;We return to the orcs who spent their time hunting... their leader seems to have killed a giant lizard of considerable size


****
****
**Krogg**

****

&gt;Now me and da bois don't wanna get shocked so we'z gonna hunt while the other bois get the thingamajig they want

&gt;I 'ear some nob cry out "another nat 20?!"

&gt;Wot are dey on about

&gt;I'm tracking some beast or other when I'm suddenly swallowed whole by some monster

&gt;Now... Krogg no like tight spaces

&gt;Makes Krogg scared

&gt;When Krogg get scared he get angry

&gt;Krogg punch his way out of the beast

&gt;Should be gud 'nough for hunt right?

&gt;Show my prize to bone boi and they want to make a hat outa it to give to me

&gt;Noice

&gt;They have a competition

&gt;Goat boi is not good at this and just sets 'is hat on fire

&gt;Bone boi make an okay hat

&gt;But shiny boi makes an amazing hat out of amazing materials (I'z 'ear another nat 20 but I I'z thinking it just the wind)

&gt;I Take'z

&gt;On the way to new base my bois gather some shrooms at shinny boi's request

&gt;'Owever no-one told me our new base was gunna be a giant dragon!!


****
****
**Jim**

****

&gt;Momonga gets a magical spear that seems to summon lightning at regular intervals... honestly i think it's too danagerous to carry it but whatever... I'm numb to this buy this point

&gt;IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY

&gt;We come across a beast the size of a mountain bound in chains that slow it's movement and dig into it's scales and a destroyed city on it's back

&gt;And what do these fools decide?! to make it our base?!

&gt;I... I... WHAT?!

&gt;However I soon gather my courage (aided by heroism)

&gt;After some talks in draconic it seems it'll let us live here if we help free it from it's chains

&gt;I can't say I'm thrilled by the prospect

&gt;For once i'm agreeing with the orcs.. but it seems this is outside of my control

&gt;No sooner had we arrived had Momonga began talking about a mushroom garden

&gt;Send help

Vacuum issues with ITB? Hey all,

I am working on a build for a 2.0L Ford Duratec (a.k.a. Mazda MZR) using ITBs from a GSZR-1000.  I am getting issues with it running SUPER rich at idle, and have determined that the major cause (or at least one of them) is that I am not getting good vacuum numbers.  At idle it is sitting at 85-95kPa so the MS is dumping fuel like I am at WOT.  I can adjust the VE tables, but that is just treating the symptoms.  I am going to add larger vacuum ports on the runners closer to the actual intake ports to try and get more normal numbers (the ports on the throttle bodies are tiny [like less than a mm] and are right up against the butterflys) but I am wondering if anyone else that has gone ITB has had similar issues?  I am using the stock onboard MPX4250 MAP sensor (MS3 3.0 with MS3X expansion), if that makes any difference.  I want to eventually run the fuel load in ITB mode, so moving  to Alpha-N-only is something I would like to avoid.

yOuR dOg HaD mAnY sEiZuReS? tOuGh. short story from my mum when she was a teen.

also the entitled parent isnt an entitled parent to a child as more to an entitled parent to a dog.

so her family used to own a Jack Russell named Tinker, and by the time she was 17, he was very old and used to have fits. he would suddenly start to whimper and then shake. usually they were quite mild. but one time it lasted much longer and afterwards he was nearly unconscious, so they took him to the local vet. once it was their appointment, cue the Entitled Owner (EO), a fat hoe with a "Can I talk to the Manager" attitude to the slightest issue. As my mum and Tinker were about to have him checked, a commotion happens:

EO: i must have my dog checked     n     o     w

Vet: wot?!

EO:he is in c r i t i c a l condition. have him checked      n     o     w

Mum: but i am in here-

EO: why should i care? my dogs had a s e i z u r e  and all your dogs doing is sleep!

Mum: are you serious? my dogs had several due to his old age, and he is severely ill.

EO: fuck you just put him down my dogs young so its d     i     f     f     e    r     e     n     t

Vet: No. Get Out and Wait your Turn. (my mum) has had this appointment booked first and it is rude to threaten someone like that.

EO: nO i DoN't CaRe ChEcK mY dOg  N     O
    W

Luckily, we were the only people at the vets then and the other ER had opened up so she went in there instead. but not before flipping off my mother for standing her ground. I do know that after EOs appointment she was banned from the vet.

She always got a good laugh after telling this story.

Naturally aspirated vs turbocharged engines in cold start It is typically known that with current modern fuel injected engines, you can start it up in freezing temperatures and use it lightly (slowly increasing RPMs, not going WOT) to get it warmed up the quickest. The point is that you do NOT want to overly stress the engine with high revs when it's not up to warm operating temperatures. Prolonged habit of abusing the engine when cold can result in accelerated engine wear.

I think for the most part we can agree on that. Cool.

This definitely applies to NA engines and turbocharged engines of old (typically turbos that have boost kick in the high RPMs). I know a couple friends with STis that follow the warm up process and not go into boost as if it was part of the 10 commandments (maybe it's an EJ ting iunno).

But now every car and their mother has a turbo inline 4. And the boost? Always kicks in the low to mid RPMs and dies out. Typically in the 1500,2000 to 4500 range. **In theory, wouldn't the constant early boost (even with light throttle) create accelerated engine wear during constant cold starts?** I would imagine it is identical to revving and stressing out an NA engine cold. Does the same logic apply?

This always concerns me when I drive my parent's SUV with a 2.0T sometimes and it has been -20C consistently as of late. Apologies if this is a dumb question.

Black Border Cornfield C.H.I.M.P.S. Guide v8.0 With the recent Obyn buffs, and that one front page video of Obyn solo'ing til round 16, thought I'd try my hand at a chimps run. Black border was a nice cherry on top!

Round number indicates beginning of the round, unless otherwise stated:

Make sure wall of trees is refreshed, and ideally as far back on the track as it can go, and spam brambles. As soon as spike storm comes off cooldown, use it again. As the BAD pops, which should be right above the permaspike pile, use sabo. Timing is key; sabo has to happen immediately. Rest will be cleaned up by permaspike/impale!

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I went home to try and optimize my strats on the second go around, and lost my permaspike pile. This pile is crucial for beating the BAD. That explains the slight position differences in my last picture versus all the others.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps someone!

[Update] After 6 months of running around, I finally got my vasectomy yesterday... Honestly, this has been one of the stupidest things I've had to get done in the military (stupid as in none of it was streamlined and took too much effort on my part). TL;DR at bottom.

So, 6 months ago,  I posted on this subreddit asking for military advice on getting a vasectomy. About 2 weeks after I posted that, I was waiting on a call from Family Practice who were the ones that were going to do my procedure.  I decided to call them and they informed me that they would call me sometime in October.  In the middle of October, I called them and they switched it to November.  So, I talked to one of my coworkers about his vasectomy, and he said he had gotten his procedure done with the Urology department.

So, I called Urology and they informed me that my referral was sent to Family Practice, and I would have to get it moved over to them to set up an appointment.  I went back to my PMC (Primary Care Manager, the doctor in charge of me and my medical concerns who is also a civilian^whoislazy^af) and he couldn't see me for another two weeks because of booking (yes, this system is stupid, it's easier on a ship/submarine because it's military taking care of military).  I talked to the front desk about having my referral transferred to Urology.  The person at the front desk said that only Family Practice was authorized to perform the procedure due to local instructions (u wot m8).  I asked if they had the instruction so I could read it and told them that another person in my shop had his referral sent to Urology about 2 months ago.  They didn't have the instruction (go figure surface ***s making shit up) and said that referral didn't happen and to go talk to Family Practice to set up my appointment.

So, as I was walking out of the clinic, I noticed a door that was labeled something along the lines of referral manager.  I talked to the lady inside and she was able to redirect my referral to Urology and said she doesn't know why it sent to Family Practice in the first place since they were back up in scheduling and Urology is available.  She said that my PCM should've done that since they can see schedules.

Scroll forward about a week later at the end of October and I am finally in Urology receiving the brief on the procedure.  Shortly after the doctor said he wanted to speak with me before I schedule.  Turns out I was rare for them because I'm single with no kids, and even though they don't refuse anyone since this is an elective surgery, they wanted to just ask some questions.  It was mainly the big "why" question.  I told him I just don't care to have kids and on both sides of my family, I had medical issues and even though I was clear of these issues so far in my life, there was no guarantee I couldn't pass them on.  He made some comments that I'm pretty sure most of you would've flipped out about, but the only thing I cared about was "Well, we won't refuse you.  We just want to make sure you understand that this is permanent."  I told him "Yep, I know it is, or else I wouldn't have come here."  He nodded and sent me on my way.

I went to the front desk and ended up walking out without scheduling because the specific doctor I went to gives people a 30 day waiting period before he'll do the procedure (he is also the only doctor that does the no-scalpel procedure which I chose because I didn't want stitches).  On top of that, the closest opening was on the 14th of December which was the start of my leave, and I was planning on driving from Southeast Georgia to Illinois which doesn't work when I would have been placed in a light duty status for 2 weeks.  So after my leave ended on January 4th, I scheduled the surgery for the 25th.

On the 25th, my co-worker and I drove our way to the Hospital. I walked in fully mentally prepared for what was to come...except I forgot one small (actually really big) thing, my command authorization form.  Basically, anytime you have to get surgery (unless it's an emergency), the command you belong to has to approve it, especially if it puts you in a condition where you can't be utilized 100% (called light duty).  The form stated I would be placed on medical leave for 3 days post surgery and be on light duty for 2 weeks after.  FML, I felt like a moron and rescheduled for the 1st of February.  After I got back to work, I rerouted all my paperwork to reflect my surgery on the 1st and then placed it in my car where it stayed until yesterday when I took it out when I was outside the hospital.  I also has a different co-worker with me who was new to the entire area.  He had forgotten his military ID which I was initially freaking out about since there are some bases you can't get on with a temporary pass or ID, but thankfully, this was not one them, and we got on with my ID and his driver's license.

My surgery was pretty uneventful except after the first...um, hole? (like i said, scalpel-free procedure) was made and the vas deferens was cut, the doctor went to cauterize the ends and wound up shocking my right testicle which made my whole body jump like 3 inches off the operating table.  It didn't hurt but I started laughing like crazy after it happened and made the corpsman (navy nurse basically) laugh as well.  I'm now just sitting here, fresh out the shower with a bag of frozen peas in my lounge pants trying to figure out what to do after finishing this post.  Maybe finish watching JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or play Kingdom Hearts 3.

TL;DR.  Navy doctors gave me to run around for 3 months, then lied to me about rules.  I wound up bypassing the medical chain of command and get referred to Urology department which gets me in and briefed in one week.  Then I waited 2 more months just because of my own schedule before scheduling on the 25th which gets moved one more week because I'm an idiot.  Then when I am finally getting the procedure done, my right testicle gets shocked during and makes my entire body jump up on the operating table.

Wot So this just happened and I don't know if it's really entitlement but IDK where else to post this.
So I have a friend who has ferrets and their mom is.......well their not that bight. I have 4 cats. So my friend just messages me saying her mom wants some cat food. I get over to their house with a small plastic baggie with it and I'm just so confused. I give it to her and she gives it to the ferrets. I'm no professional but I don't think thats healthy for them? I assumed that she forgot to run for food and just needed it this one time. I come over to my friend's house again (now), and I come in and her mom's just waiting for me. She asks where's the cat food and I'm just confused. I said I don't have any and now I'm talking with my friend and apparently my friend's mom is too lazy to buy food for her ferrets? That's not right. What should I do about it?

What are best riddims from the Golden Era of Grime (2003 - 2010)? IMHO 2003 - 2010 era of Grime was really the **Golden Era.** The scene was started and the sound became...a sound really.

People will disagree. Rather than justify, I'm just gonna drop my favourite riddims below, with **up to three** from each year.

*This is my list but it would be sick to see other people's. What are your favourite tunes?*

*This is as much about debate amongst the OG's, as it is about introducing some of the classic tunes new grime heads might have missed.*

1750 Dreadnaughts Ultramarines Three Round Touney Batrep Hi there guys. Posting again a local touney which i participated in. This is was a three round touney using the first 3 missions from CA2018 using ITC rules. I unfortunately forgot to take to many pics i will link them in the post as i go on.

List: Gman, Tiggy, 2x Redemptors (full dakka), 2x Mortis Contemptors (Kheres), Lev dread (Storm, 2x HKM), 2x3 Scout Bikers (Sbolter), Loyal 32 (catachan) : 1750 pts 12 cp

I really want to play a dreads list and i finally was able to finish painting my redemptors. I understand when ppl look at this list i will die to a castellan (I KNOW). However i did have some practice games vs knights (non castellan) and Castellan lists and still manage to win (even tho it was gman as the last model in most games for me) due to how CA2018 missions favor holding obj and knights tend to have difficulty with these new missions.

As you can figure the idea of this list is to move up with the dreads and shove gman down the ops lines, simple. While loyal 32 and SBikers either screen or grab obj or go after stragglers.

&amp;#x200B;

Meta breakdown: 1x Necrons, 2x Tau, 3x Custodes (1x Full Bikers, Castellan, FW stuff and troops), Imperial Fists (using MW centurions), 2x Mechanicus (1x knight), 1x Eldar, 1x Tsons (20 rubric and Magnus), 1x Ultramarines (ME), 1x orks, 1x Harlequins, 2x AM, 1x Knights.  (4 lists in total had a knight).

&amp;#x200B;

Game 1 (Ultramarines vs Tau) :

Tau List (Guestimate) : Coldstar, darkstider, 1x10 Breachers, 1x10 Strike, 2x Devilfish (burst cannon), Longstrike (ion cannon, SMS, SMissiles), 3x Hammerhead (SMS, Ion Cannon, 2x SMissiles) 2x Skyray Gunships ( 6x SMissiles), 2x Firestight markerlights.   Tau sept and other marker lights and drones on other tanks.

As you can see this was sorta a mech on mech match up. We played the Cut of the Head CA2018 missions. Op won the die role for deployment, so i deployed first. Obj was in the middle and there were 4 large buildings 12" circle around the obj. Unfortunately tau manage to seize on me and focused 1x redemptor and 1x mortis, bringing both to 2,3 W.  I moved forward with my whole army except the wounded dreads and claimed the middle obj preaty much for the whole game. We traded shooting shots back and forth . I lost my lev dread due to forget to cast Might of heroes on him, and he lost like half of his army likewise.  we only manage to go to turn 3. Final Score 7 for Ultramarines, 4 tau. Probably would have been a much larger lead if game kept going.

Thoughts: Notice no invul save on redemptors was kinda painful, only saving grace was the 2cp cover strat for turn 1. 2x3 scouts bikers with gman (similar to aggressors) can srs put the hurt on tanks. Even tho my dreads where on there last profile it LEGIT did not matter with gman rerolls (next time someone says degrading matters i will call BS on that call, if they are running gman).

&amp;#x200B;

Game 2 (Ultramarines vs Tempestus Scion/AM):

AM/TScion list : 2x Tempestor Prime (rod), 4x5 TScions (PPistol, 2x Meltas), 1x 10 TScions (3x Flamer), 2x TCommandSquads (4x Plasma) 2x Valkyrie, Taurox Prime (Bcannon, 2x Autocannon), Tank Commander (battle cannon (relic hammer of sunderace)), Demolosher LRuss, Executioner LRuss, Eradicator LRuss (ALL WITH HBOLTERS). He had Tscion in all the transports.

We played the CA mission that had the null zone field and gets smaller.  Dawn of war, i had to deploy first, did the usual put everything around gman in the middle of the table and put my loyal 32 and bikers on flank/screening duty to stop valks and DS.

Here is a pic of the end of the game(at the end, this is the point i forgot to take pics): [https://photos.app.goo.gl/PjZDrkt35WeszxZF9](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PjZDrkt35WeszxZF9)

On my Turn 1 it legit too my whole firepower to just kill 1 LRuss (was fairly annoyed op was rolling like a boss). At least i killed 1 LRuss and injured another to middle profile. He placed his Valk in the corners so i could not target them, on his turn 1 he moved 1 behind my lines and other in front of my screen. In shooting he injured and killed one redemptor and cleared some of my screen.

On my turn 2 I blew both his planes out of the sky and 1 more LRuss. The dudes who where behind my backline got assaulted by Gman, redemptor  and tiggy. I mange to kill all of his reg guys and left his TPrime alive (this ensured he could not shoot my redemptor, cuz his tprime was stuck and could not fall back.

Op turn 2: and shot some more but did minimal but was holing the middle obj due to have more obsec.

Turn 3- 6: at this point Tscions ran out of steam and was running over my op at this point. I ended up tabling him.

Final score: 7:3

Thoughts: Loyal 32 are beast at doing everything. redemptors pull a crap tone of shots.

&amp;#x200B;

Game 3 (Ultramarines vs Castellan) :

Op List: Loyal 32 (cadian), Custodes Battalion: 3x Shield caps (2x 3++ invuls) (warlord 5+ full no  pain) 2x3 Custodes troops (2x Spear, 1x SShield), Castellan (2 Shield breaker Missiles)

Pics of game : [https://photos.app.goo.gl/zEABxS1ifY6TGD4j6](https://photos.app.goo.gl/zEABxS1ifY6TGD4j6)

O boy this was a game. We played the Vital Intelligence mission.  Ill just make a TLDR. I was fairly unlucky with the terrain and some roles through the game. If you take a look at the pics i posted, you can see there is this huge road. Problem with this road is that my dreads and gman can not go through and need to be on it. My tiggy perils turn 1 (will cp rerolls to stop but meh) and goes to 1 W (my op kills him with shield breaker strat). Me unable to move forward, end up not being able to contest the middle of the board. So it was a shooting gallery for the Castellan. In one turn of shooting i manage to deal 20 W to the castellian with just my lev dread (hkm and 20 shots). I manage to kill 2 SCaps, but i swear his warlod biker (who had 2 W left)  took 36 Kheres shots over 3 turns and did not die (salty a little).

I ended up losing 21 - 8.

I new at turn 4 game was over. If i would do this game again on this same terrain i would have placed all my dread on one side of the road. This would have at list helped me move up on one side, while i leave the infantry to grab the obj.

If we played on any other table we had there that game i, am fairly certain i could have won (not to say my op was bad, he was good and did all the right moves).

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts: Would i bring this type of list again. Def yes. I have enough practice vs knights that i can win vs them (play the obj game). Thoughts on the redemptors: I found that unless your playing against a Castellan, if they survive turn 1 they live for the rest of the game cuz you will be targeting those units that can kill them. Gman, tiggy , lev is a beast combo. scouts biker are good (need more practice with them, 2nd time playing with them). Loyal 32 (mvp)

&amp;#x200B;

Would like to hear your thoughts and wot not. hope you enjoy the batrep.

&amp;#x200B;

EM tries to take my phone and get free icecream EM - entitled Mom
MW- my worker


Been bit sick and haven’t went back to work for a week. I have 2 phone: A company phone that we share and my own phone.
Like the idiot I am, I forgot to bring the company phone and had to use my own phone at the front desk.



EM: “Hey there, can I get a (Gelato) with (Gelato).
I heard you offer free ice cream to kids?”

MM:”I’m sorry, we do not offer discounts for children”

EM:”but she’s such a good girl! She’s so pretty and she gets straight A’s” I think she was 6?

MM: “sorry, but we don’t offer any discounts at all,is there anything else I can get you”

EM:”excuse me? You make children pay for icecream? Capitalist dogs.”

MM:”we are a for profits business, please, you are holding up the line”

EM:”EXCUSE ME! HOW DARE YOU VALUE OTHER CUSTOMERS OVER MY PRECIOUS DAUGHTER? YOU WORK AT AN ICECREAM ON MINIMUM WAGE”
Funny thing, he was the supervisor for the day and gets paid 22$/hour.

I hear the yelling through my door and headphones.
 I come out and check what the fuck is going on.

Me: “Ma’am, if you wouldn’t mind getting and paying for your order first, if you keep this up I’m going to dial security”

At this point, she gets the order and sits down, I decide to stay out in the open area for a bit to check on my Employees and make a coffee for MM.

I notice the uneasy in the store, the customers are looking at her funny and she keeps on whispering something to her child while texting at 90 miles/hour.

She finishes her ice-cream and comes to talk to me:

EM: “So you greedy pigs don’t give children free gelato?”

Me: once again ma’am, we are not offering discounts at this time, and as a matter of fact, the only discount is the employee discount”

EM: “so you greedy fucks care about money more than children?”

Me: “if we offered free ice-cream to children, we would be broke by now”

EM: “I don’t care!(excuse me wot) your employees are all failures and fucking dropouts! They don’t need this job, just give me a refund on my icecream”



Me: “ma’am, your child already finished the icecream, since (company name) is not giving out free gelato to children, i will not grant you a refund”

EM: “Fine, Capitalist fuck”

I go out for a cig break to calm myself a bit. (Don’t judge)

EM:”hey there, pass me that phone”

MM:”pardon me?”

EM:”give me that phone, my child wants a new phone and you all aren’t using it”

MM:”ma’am, that is our company phone, we call/receive calls from our suppliers with that phone”

EM:”MY CHILD DESERVES AN IPHONE X (my phone is an XR) AND YOU KNOW HOW GOOD SHE IS”

EM proceeds to start swearing and screaming about capitalism, insulting my customers and employees (quite racist insults I might add).

By the time I come back I see security talking to her.
I made the security man a coffee and asked him to blacklist her.

One day he found a Yordle a real Yordle unlike many he could say he actually saw one he smiled and greeted the small man "what is your name great smith" the mustached creature remarked "Corn" Vortiger found this to be and odd name for such a noble creature "why call yourself that great smith" the creature snorted "because I live in it I am colored like it therefore I am Corn". After much talk the man introduced his daughter  Corna who had found a great artifact "what is it" Vortiger asked the girl said "it is you you are the man my father has been waiting for" the hairy man raised a bushy eyebrow "wot" he said this as if the word fell out of his mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

"yeah he is the green king with the radiant smile" she says pointing to Vortiger's impeccable teeth "well I'll be" he replied. After much time he had a new sword and shield and a squire "this is sublime I can't wait to stop the hatred with this tool of peace the girl was horrified to hear him say that as the stone said he would die if he did that and Noxus would fall into chaos so instead the girl led him to Bandle city were he could really see it for what it actually was as now because of the sword he was no longer mortal and therefore could see the truth of all Yordles.

93 ford probe V6 MT hesitation issues I'm stumped! Been at this for a year and i cant' find the source of my hesitation issues.

Symptoms: under WOT around 4k the engine seems to sputter and lose power momentarily, like a small stumble. It picks back up at around 5k rpm and pulls smooth and fast to redline. Otherwise the car starts up fine, it drives fine, its smooth at idle.

Things I've done as maintenance + hunting down this issue since I bought the car a year ago:

•replaced: spark plugs + wires, cap + rotor, fuel filter, air filter, TPS, MAF, oil/oil filter, battery, and I (painstakingly) replaced all vacuum lines. I also replaced some malfunctioning solenoids including one tied to the fuel pressur regulator but that didn't fix it.

•checked, all seems ok: ignition coil, distributor, timing, fuel pressure regulator.

At this point I'm starting to suspect the fuel pump. It is a 26 year old car and although it only has 67k miles on it I imagine that's a long time for a car that sat idle for so long. I'm thinking of buying a fuel pump pressure test kit, unless you awesome people think there's anything else I need to check?

Thank you so much!

2004 F350 6.0 - Fuel pressure drop during hard acceleration/wot UPDATE Ok so last week I posted about my truck having no fuel pressure that was solved with new filters and blue spring upgrade. P,revious ones only had less than 3000 miles as I changed them when I bought the truck. All Motorcraft filters.

Today I installed a new stock pump and cleaned out the hfcm.

Maybe it's a coincidence but this all happened after running howes diesel additive for 2 tanks (previous tank and the one before that).

Since I bought the truck the fuel gauge intermittently works. This the previous owner warned me about.

Details:
04 F350 Crew Cab Lariat 4wd 178k miles
T6 5w40 (for last 3000 miles)
5" mbrp straight pipe (for last 3000 miles)
SCT X4 with IDP Street tune. (for last 3000miles)
Egr delete done @ 40k miles
Xdp coolant filter
Sinister diesel fuel filter cap with glowshift fuel pressure sender.

Current fuel pressure at idle is 55-60psi. Sometimes 60-65. Normal driving it goes to 50. 60% or more throttle it'll go to 35psi before I let off then goes back up to 50-55.

I ordered a 2nd blue spring kit and going to re do it just incase I forgot something or messed it up during install.

I've also ordered a new in tank pump and sender assembly. So will drop the tank and inspect the inside.

Any ideas? Feedback on my plan. How do you do a vacuum test on the tank and lines?

Mk6 intake comparison There's a lot of talk about cold air intakes and whether they actually make a difference. I decided to dig out my old APR Carbonio intake scoop and compare it to IE's cold air intake to see how much of a difference there actually was.

The car: 2012 Golf R.

The relevant mods: IE stage 2, Autotech HPFP, Unitronic intercooler, Milltek turboback, CTS turbo outlet pipe and throttle pipe.

The method: I don't have access to a dyno, so I had to compare MAF readings and approximate power (MAF readings are generally 80% of horsepower, so maf/0.8 = HP). I did three runs at WOT in third gear for each setup. I can post the full logs, but for the purpose of this comparison I was only concerned with peak MAF reading.

With IE intake: peak MAF reading of 284.8g/s at 6400rpm, approximately 356hp.

With APR Carbonio inlet scoop on stock airbox with Pipercross foam filter: Peak MAF 248g/s at 6400rpm, approximately 311hp.

So there you have it - on a stage 2 car with full bolt-ons, the filter-on-stick cold air intake frees up approximately 45hp at the top end.

Conclusion: You only really *need* a full CAI if you're stage 2. The stock FSI intake with the Carbonio scoop should easily support stage 1/1+ power and keep OEM drivability.

**Disclaimer:** This is just a back-of-an-envelope calculation that I did for fun because I had the stuff laying around. It's not meant to be a thorough study and it's not 100% accurate. Please don't cite me in any studies. If you want more concrete data, I'll happily accept donations to pay for the dyno time.

I got several stories for you. Hi! I'm new in this forum but I thought I would share my stories, I work in two stores, Age UK is one that serves old people and LOROS is one that serves all sorts of crazy people. Here goes.

Oh, and this is based in Leicester, in the UK.

1. Loros: The lady tried to sell me Irish money, - So this old woman was coming up to me and gave me four cards, the subtotal came to  £2. Now, I have never handled Irish money, but for a disclaimer I know that Northern Ireland is a part of Britain, but in this case I didn't want to go through the hassle. And I wasn't sure if the rate in Ireland was different. So the lady asked for the manager, my finger was already touching the bell below the desk to get the manageress here. The manager didn't want to take it and even the lady's daughter said no. It took three people to tell her she couldn't spend irish money here. Plus, it looked pretty old so we don't know what fakes or real ones look like. So the daughter paid for it with English money anyway.
2. Age UK: Grumpy Mrs King. Now, in villages you always have a grumpy person and well, we got a few to name. Theres a lady that comes to the shop every saturday morning and she sparks up a conversation with ME! And she even has a laugh with me when I help put on her sweater and her coat. (It was really f":"&gt;ing cold). The manageress was stood there in back in shock like, "What the f@ck". And it's only me that she has a conversation with, I'm still in awe,
3. Age UK: Discounts. I know that people don't want to pay an extra 50p because they're too lazy to get their purse out again, this is really annoying. I was serving a man at the till, his sweater came to  £5.50 and he only had a five pounds note. I said to him, "I'm sorry, we can't do discount unless the product is damaged." (This is a charity shop, for a good cause... WHY DISCOUNT?!!?) Anyway, he asked for the manager and the manager said the same thing. He ended up paying the extra 50p.
4. Loros: Designer clothing part 1. There was a russian couple that came in with a Giovanni dress &amp; jacket. (RRP is like  £400.) And from what me and the shop mother understood, was that they wanted money back on the product that they purchased from us. I was kinda thinking.... "Wot?"but as 10 minutes passed with the manageress talking to them, nothing changed. Literally nothing. All they wanted was money back, because they're going to be adjusting the sleeves on the dress. WHY? It's worth over  £ 400 JUST SELL IT ON EBAY YOU MONSTER. Aaaaaanyway, they was discussing a full refund of £90 for the dress and the jacket, and considering we had already done a £70 refund for someone else, I was screaming in my head of them to just take the clothes and leave, please don't do a refund. And they didn't. But the lady bought a horrible green suit for £40.
5. Loros: designer clothing part 2. A lady came in wanted a refund on a Nina Ricci hankerchief, Ted Baker dress and a jacket. The subtotal on the receipt came to £77, the purpse of the refund was that the dress was too small. I get that people are too lazy to try on clothes, but this is a god damn charity. But we issued a refund, 20 minutes later she bought a bag from the glass cabinet that came to £50. So we got some of it back anyway.

And omg so many hot lads walk in, myself and the shop mother are just drooling.

I'm done ranting &lt;3

I feel like i'm "back-up" for my ex-gf(18), me(18) Second of april 2018 i played a game and i met a girl. To make it clear in that moment i would never tought i would date her or anything...

So i met a girl, we used to play and call together for whole spring. Had a rlly good time, fun etc. To make it more embarrassing i can tell you that i tought that she way older than me, and also it took like 2 months before she told me her name (i knew her name cuz her mum few times walked to her room and she had mic on)...

At the start of summer holidays she went on a vacation for 12 days (without any "goodbye" or "cya") I had a job for summer holidays so i played for a short time only so no big deal for me (but it bothered me anyway)

*Job* - 6am-16pm, in 45°C manually moving and building racks so pretty heavy for me with my 65kg/183cm but good launch and free drink... Fair job for me

*The worst moment of my life*

Like a day before she left i met on fb another girl talking about some problems and i found out we have same opinion. So i tried to contact her, play with her etc again, no big deal for me
She was kinda arrogant from my point of view 'cuz after job i was tired, and she was angry that im not talking to her but we sort that out..
The point is one day she was angry again and for some reason i said that i love her...................
That imidietly changed everything, she was more friendly to me etc... Problem is i never saw her (dont judge pls)
Well after that the first one arrived and we havent spoke much. One day my fb-gf git jealous cuz i said that shes texting me so without my awarness she wrote her to step back and leave me alone with her (fb girl -&gt; vacation girl). Vac. Girl texted me and i was kinda confused, because i didnt want to lose her, despite this i tried to gently told her i dont wanna be with her anymore. I felt dreadfully.

Few days later
She was from other end of the state, (example - im from Moskva she's from Vladivostok, distance is like 400km, my state has 480km) i was a littlebit sceptic when she said she will arrive and be here for a week.... so one night i found her picture on the internet and well turned out shes like 90kg/150cm..... I knew my dad would kill me, and also im more to skinny types (im skinny af) so it was fucking terrible for me to say it but decisions must be made, we broke up

*If you've invented memory cleaner contact me pls*

For the first time i felt like i was controlled by someone (i was awake until like 4am cuz fb gf had some "problems" and she needed me to help her, and also i left vac girl cuz of her) i felt rlly sorry for vac girl and i texted her a "sorry" message probably longer than this post (im kinda good at long stories).
She accepted and i was happy...
Not sure how this happend but i remember i was so fucking sad and confused by recent events that i told her everything, all my feeling, all my previous gfs, everything that happend and so on.... Thats probably how we managed to know eachother as a humans not as players... By the end of july we started to feel something, and we fell in love (i knew how she looked like) 14 of August she wrote me legendary message "parents arent home".....
Well ofcourse i came (160km probably by the road) and it was definetly the best trip ive ever made... Great weather wonderful nature, lucky traffic and no more details for u...

During summer she joined some groups that focus on recording videos....
(You know pornhu...... ofcourse it made only story based films of our game we played you pervert)
She met new people etc and we found ourselfs in position where we had nothing to talk about, i even tried to avoid calling with her, because once she hang-up call and then texted me "sorry, theres no fun with you" okey, i guess i csnt blame her for that but hang-up, and 30min after that text me the reason why??? That was second time we broke up i think. Months passed by and it was november, she texted me and i said fuck it, i went in and started to call again etc ... Problem is that we both played only 1 game - MC (the one we met with) i played like R6s, wot, and some singleplayer stuff, she played games like LoL and cs:go - i rlly dislike cs:go cuz of poor development and lol cuz i dont like the way its played... She doesnt like and also couldnt play my games...
She insisted on playing LoL so i did downloaded it and she challenged me to 1v1. We fought, she killed me like 7 times i killed her like 3 times, by the time i killed her 3. time she got mad, left call, blocked me on instagram, on discord, deleted me from all her profiles etc..
Few weeks after she added me and again i said fuck it and took it, and i asked her why she did that, she replied sith "i was angry"....
Time passed by, we had again good time and christmas time came...
 I wanted to visit her, bring her a gift and have a good time. Well first problem, by the start of a week when i wanted to arrive she said shes ill... Okey so i have a gift for her here on a table ready to send it atleast... One night we texted again, so personal stuff and then we talked about christmas, i asked about present, she said she doesnt want any presents, that she wants me.
18+- of november we called and i asked what is her wish for christmas and she said she wants 1 person to arrive. Pretty obvious isnt it. I asked if i know that person (wasnt sure she means me) she replied with yes, so i asked if i met that person, and she said no............
In that moment that game was over for me, so i asked if that person is from that studio shes in... She said yes... Well i knew exactly who was it. It was Z-guy. She said "all i want for christmas is him to arrive" i was confused af again...
Well to introduce you, Z guy is one of the owners of the studio, hes 21+- and she isnt even 18... I tought that im rlly old for her... Okey, maybe hes better looking or funnier but the fact that killed me the most -&gt; he often ignored her messages, replied in like 6h delay, she also many times deleted her message cuz of no response...
One day we called, she said she will leave because of studion and again no goodbye, or anything else. Next time we called and she said me that she wrote some other guy from studio that "i wanna call with him but i know he wont answer in time", if he would do that i have no doubt she would leave again... So on 23 of november i said her all of this + something more, i said that i feel no respect, and that i feel like a friend she has when she gets bored... She replied with single "sorry" and blocked me everywhere again.
In january she started to follow me on instagram, but i did not follow her, so after few days she stopped following me. By the end of january she added me on discord and now by 2 of february she texted me that she miss me, miss our calls, our game and basiclly ME. For the first time in my life i was rlly deppressed when i broke up with her on christmas, but i kept telling myself to let her go. On evening 3 of february she texted me that she wanna just talk, so i told her about my current state, that im depressed and she said she had the same feeling in january... I have birthdays on 4th of february, it was my 18 birthdays. She know that i have them, she has my fb where you can see it and no suprise to me 0 messages from her. Idk if i should blame her or not i had my peace when i let her, now shes back saying she miss ME, but yet she forgets something like this. No "merry christmas" it was me who wished "happy new year" to her. I tought she wrote me primarly because of birthdays but now i feel like im a joke for her, im not even sure if something change since christmas idk.
Someone told me she will be more "responsible" when she grow older but im not sure i want be with her when theres many others nearby and im not sure if i wanna be in this "friends only" relationship, because deppression that was nearly gone is comming back...


I know that if she would spoke to me it would probably answer many questions but shes the type that cant pretty much put her feelings into message if she doesnt want to and thats the problem for me, idc if she says sorry 10000x times idc if she tells me about loosing a friend, idc if she tells me about a boy she broke up year ago idc if she tells me about her current feelings but she just wont...

My Little That Guy, Pt 2 (the Kender Pony) Hello everyone.

My apologies for this  being a little late. In the middle of writing this the first time my power went out, and everything went kaput, then other projects garnered my attention, and then it became longer than it should’ve. So let’s try this again.

&gt; Short Version

We’re a party of bronies that are playing in a pony-centric game of Pathfinder with a module called Ponyfinder. In our initial group of weirdos and friendos we had two members who made us want to tear our hair out. The first [depicted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/aaopje/my_little_that_guy_pt_1/) was a cleric who stood around and did fuck all while making the occasional snipe or snarky comment. Eventually he got his ass kicked from the group due to his instablity as a player, his treatment of other players, and how he saw himself as the main character to a TV series (I meant this literally).

...and yet, the guy we got to replace him was somehow even worse. Whereas the previous guy was reactive in his horror, this guy was more proactive in such. As the title implied he played a Kender-like Pony that tried to boss the party while doing their best to either piss off every npc we ran into or get ourselves killed, on top of latching onto another player’s character in a creepy way and causing more infighting. Eventually they fucked right off, but only after they got themselves killed due to reality ensuing on their sugary little ass.

For elaboration on guy 2, read on.

&gt; Pre-Amble

The system is Pathfinder, with the DM allowing 3.0e, 3.5e, and lots of 3pp stuff to build to our hearts content so long as we don’t try to metagame the world in half. The campaign is in a world that’s more of a pony version of Insert-tabletop-setting-here with stuff from all generations of MLP rather than Friendship is Magic’s world. The players’s characters all met under a clandestine organization based around homeland security and their globetrotting adventures are often scouting missions that end up being much more than they seem, akin to Star Trek’s “You’re the only ship close enough to deal with the plot” storylines with more being stranded in the middle of nowhere.

Over the course of the first adventure the party’s ass was handed to it by the powers that be, and as a result the party became corrupted with powers outside the ordinary standard for ponies or adventures. Will be going over that as the party will be introduced, as this will provide some much needed context.

~~Ghost Pony~~ Kalashtar Monk. The long lived race playing against the type to punch things in the face. Party pervert who’s perversion is never taken seriously, while their player is an all around nice guy. Their special snowflake power is the Shadow Beast template, as well as the ability to absorb magical items. While the latter part of that can spiral out of control, the character themselves [is pretty dumb so it kinda balances out](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/113/006/39e.gif).
~~Pegasus~~ Aarakocra Druid. Shy plant loving flyer that seldom flies, and has an *intense* burning hatred for bipedal creatures after a traumatic event, and most things that would hurt the party. Player irl is quiet shy but knows Path quite well, so they often come off as the show’s Fluttershy mixed with [HotdiggetdyDemon’s Fluttershy](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/OldNeighboringAgouti-size_restricted.gif), with magic nature powers. Their power gave them totally not scary ability of putting people to sleep before killing them and summon more powerful summons.
~~Hippogryph~~ Fire Genasi Psion. All around cool player that plays their character like the Fonz mixed with Yusuke Urameshi. Their power makes them exude a literal aura of awesomeness that grants boons to the rest of the party, and alter their blasts with different variants and abilities, enhancing their ~~stand~~ constructs further. Also to note, because the player actually read part 1, their character didn’t start acting like the Fonz till after they got their power. I gotchu fam.
~~Antean Unicorn~~ Giant Dragonborn Warder. Party muscle with a soft heart and a father who’s a mafia boss. Quite the awesome player when they were around, and the focus of good natured perverted jokes before it was ruined forever. The corruption gave them Barbarian’s Rage.
~~Zebra~~ Vuman “””Bard””” (Bard 2, then Bard 1/Domain Wizard X). Party Chaotic Neutral individual from a more magical Disney’s Agrabah, making them an unreliable sage as well as greaseman. Their special power ~~was getting the DM to let us use retraining rules for story purposes~~ are a couple voices in their head that are really complete characters that work off sentient magic item rules. My character. ~~There’s a reason I mentioned being the only person in the world that didn’t attribute CN to Deadpool 100% of the time, and this manifestation started as a joke.~~
Finally, the newest member.
~~Shortleg Doppelganger~~ A fucking *Kender* Mesmerist. The character was a ball of fluff with a surface level cuteness to the point of being nauseatingly saccharine. Deep down, apparently, the character had a more hard hearted bend to it that did not come of well, as you will find out. The player themselves made it that much worse with little hints of OoC bleeding into IC in strange, speculative ways. Their special power, since the Mesmerist wasn’t enough, was a [Seelie Court Fey template](https://www.realmshelps.net/monsters/templates/unseeliefey.shtml) that played upon their ability to sway and unnerve folks, billing themselves as a face and leader.


&gt; So, how did it all go wrong?

Because ~~there ain’t enough time in the day~~ brevity is the soul of wit, I’m gonna compound these all the situations together instead of speaking in chronological order exclusively.

&gt; The player was a creep

Should mentioned that I actually played with this person before, in a game made by the module creator to test things out. I quickly found out that I wouldn’t be as much help as I wanted to be and bowed out, but I do remember this character of theirs being somewhat similar to what we ended up with. Their initial high energy take meant we’d have someone in the party with some actual charisma so the WizardBard’s player, whom has very bad social anxiety, wouldn’t need to do performative actions when they’re hilariously bad at it, so the DM was rather welcoming, especially since they were recruited out of said module owner’s server. Their session 0 and plotreason for why they got their powers go well and they show up ready to play when the rest of us are.

So to that end, I feel partially responsible for this shit.

After the party’s first mission they were given some downtime to reflect on what they had done, gained, and gone through, with this being time for a certain character to leave and the rest of us do any book keeping that needed to be done OoC. The new guy gets assigned to us for our next mission and we spend that moment as a sort of soft reunion for ourselves and an introduction to the new person.

Two things happen.

The first is that Mesmerist’s character immediately latches onto the Warder, with adoration and praise that quickly progresses into feeling more like grooming. What initially looks like an attempt to snipe at the monk (who’s own perversions and affections were played for laughs, as said) was the character crossing the line by spending a lot of their starting and allotted gold on pointless knicknacks and a crown for this person’s character, that matched a magical helm they wanted to buy due to it’s charming abilities. This treatment continued up until we had to gently remind them how not cool this was. Although it stopped in the moment, they did keep trying to ‘cutely put the crown on Warder’ long into the mission for reasons unknown.

The second is more speculative, but also plays into part of their treatment of the party in the previous paragraph. They billed themselves as a capable Face and this was fine...but when they were given the role there was a clear projected rejection of the previous party face (being me) in the form of their actions before we shipped out. For instance, the WiBard and the Mesmerist shared an interest for plushies that was discussed OoC due the similarities (a weakness and joke for the former, and trait for the latter), and was kept as a staple...up until presented with such, which turned into vehemence and insanely detailed dismissal. It was implied something happened with their session 0/ corruption that triggered this and that explanation was suitable. What was more perplexing was the time they spent talking how much they hated “plushies” alongside less subtle jabs that made the other players ask them to stop this, too.


&gt; The player had no qualms deriding npcs, which lead to them attacking the party

We pressed on to the mission after inventory management at the quartermaster, where the sugary character does not use their diplo to diplo, and arrived at our destination shortly after, fully equipped to tackle the problems at hand. We were sent across the world to a investigate why a mine was giving off weird vibes, why contact hadn’t been established from that mine in a month or so (it provided the region with a useful magical resource) and what other information we could gather while we were there.

Getting into the mine was easy enough, but a summary of the events leading into the later sections is needed, to better illustrate how this character functioned with their surroundings and the npcs/monsters we talked to. For you see, things went like this:

NPC: Hello. What’re you doing-

Mesmerist: Mind your own business and/or go fuck yourself.

NPC: :C

(Rinse repeat, til)

NPC: &gt;:C

I think the only saving grace from this was that the Mesmerist didn’t know as many languages as the others in the party, so they couldn’t piss off *everyone*, but it did make quite a few folks hostile before we even understood what our mission was or search for information regarding such from those that was still alive at the time or was summoned into existence to help us like the Druid’s summons. This culminated in making a key NPC quite cross with the party. Twice.

The first time will be depicted in a following section, for reasons that will swiftly become obvious.

The *second* time involved said pc antagonizing this key npc to the point where they aimed a cannon at the party and told us to leave. It took a group effort/diplomancy to get them not to, and it felt like this hammering home for this PC that their actions have consequences. Even after that, though, the player kept trying to boss their way around until it was clear nobody was listening, and the damage they had done to try and take charge had long since settled in.


&gt; The player had no qualms attacking the *PARTY*

Here we go.

In the first instance of this player angering the key npc, it was when the party reconvened deeper within the mine, owned by this NPC. We were trying rest to recover health, spell slots, power points, and whatever that occured from prior combats to get to this point (some of which could’ve been avoided if a certain player hadn’t decided to opeaaaaaaAAAAA**AAAA**). The Mesmerist, for some reason, continues to distrust this NPC despite said NPC letting us into their home after the insults and secrecy. Mesmerist didn’t understand why the NPC was so angry and decided to stalk them in their own home, against the party’s wishes, pissing them off even further as they watched the npc...do paperwork.

After the NPC’s clear agitation and the party’s groans over what was essentially holding the game hostage; I, the Wibard, walked over and kindly request that the Mesmerist leave the other alone and, if they have further suspicions we could hash them out later ~~and not hold the game up further~~.

Their response? Using Hypnotic Stare on the Bard to force them to go away.

Rolling with the punches we just went along with this. The Bard failed their save, but the voices in their head did not, and (with the GM controlling these sentient notweapons, as one is a Witch and the Other an Occultist) dispelled the effect immediately. Just as immediately, the Mesmerist OoC called bullshit and began to argue that was something of a GM fiat. **Pin that for later**, but for now know that the DM mentioned that wasn’t, and the player was vocally dissatisfied with the answer up until I realized something slipped my mind and requested we play on. To sum that up, it went something like:

M: Go back to bed, like a good little Vuman.

WB: Your wish is my...okay but no seriously come on.

M: (dropping character) You’re supposed to be charmed.

WB: I forgot to add (insert feat a book that gives a +4 to Will Saves against mind affecting effects, that I took to get *another* feat that the DM knew I had and did some story stuff during downtime to get specifically), so I pass.

DM: Oh. Well seems legit then.

M: What? (without giving anyone time to respond). Well, I’ll just try again.

WB: She’s staring at me to make this work, without saying anything, right?

M: Yes.

DM: Yes, why?

WB: I hold my action, and just say “Come on. Last warniiiiing.”

Everyone else in the party was silent over this initiated PvP, but there are disapproving verbal messages from the the Druid in chat. The character, as said, tried to do their Hypnotic Stare once again...and my character used their held action to use Domain ability Which is a [paralyzingly blinding flash](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/sun-domain/light/). While the Mesmerist was reeling and the party, IC, had wondered what went on, the Wibard proceeded to [Daze]{https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze/) the character, to keep them stunlocked while they were dragged back to bed.

Let it be known, you shouldn’t try to Lawyer against another Lawyer. Especially one with a better memory.

While everyone seemed okay with this outcome, the Mesmerist’s player was not. This was the start of a streak with them talking about the things their character could’ve done if not for X, Y, or Z, and they certainly did not like their character being disabled with such ease despite the IC and OoC warnings. **Pin that one, too.** You’ll see why.

So with the red flags visible and after being threatened with eviction from one’s life, the party delves deeper into the mine to find (what’s left of) this NPC’s previous subordinates and coworkers. We find a contigen of some survivors, a lot of bodies, and some weird plants left by who did all this. The party asks what the plants for since, at this point, we know how to be cautious and not barrel into traps or wouldbe hazards. So we learn the plants have some nasty Ability Score draining capabilities even after death, and that our goal is on the other side of such. One combat and a few dead plants later we’re victorious we’re ready to move on.

...Except, the Mesmerist wants a closer look at the plants. They don’t know how to handle the plants and the Druid doesn’t want to help them since “Hey, do this.” is not a polite, they decide to look over such themselves. I wish I could’ve described their actions as anything other than them jumping into the pile of AS draining vines, but I really can’t. Worse yet, their low Strength is being drained...so the character is put into a position where they cannot lift themselves *out* of the weeds, and are slowly dying. Bless them DM for making this seem like the a big deal, at least.

As they were slowly dying the player was panicking and the characters, IC, were trying to think of a way to get them out without them being caught in this mess too, and do so quickly before the Mesmerist perished. The party implores telekinesis and wretches the character free, and uses guesswho’s Corruptionpowers(™)  to cast magic higher then what they know to fix the Mesmerist on the spot. The side effect was that the party was stunned and some of their powers changed or grew a bit, and in that time the Mesmerist apparently asked the DM to do something in private. In retrospect, the following pause of silence on the DM part alluded to what was to come, and this was the turning point for the party taking all this sitting down.

Since the Mesmerist recovered first, they cast Hypnotic Stare (or something similar) on the party, through their helm. They got the Monk, Warder, and Psion in the blast with failed saves and proceeded to laugh maniacally (OoC, yes really)  as we rolled Initiative, again. Know who they didn’t get hit? The Wizard/Bard and *the Druid*, and they don’t notice this because I still haven’t added that feat’s bonus to my sheet, and the Druid has continued to be, and stayed, quiet for a majority of this.

Bard goes first because ~~Improved Initiative~~ of course (this is a running joke for the party at this point), but doesn’t do anything but warns “You should probably quit while you’re ahead.”

Mesmerist goes next and commands the party nearest to them to kneel, while the party closest to the Bard to attack them.

The Druid, in a rare moment when they have a good initiative roll, goes next. And proceeds to use their Corruption ability to break the Mesmerist concentration, being right next to them and all. As a result, as well, the Mesmerist can no longer move, and everyone who was under the influence has to make a new save to not be stunned for a round.

The monk, because Monk, recovers from quickly and proceed and they politely warn them as well, deciding to take the kid gloves off. It goes back to the top of the round and I hold a spell, IC and OoC knowing full well what’s going to happen. The Druid, as a free action, politely tells the Mesmerist not to do that again.

Ignoring this sound advice, the Mesmerist tries to use an ability that shuts downs skills, spells and other things on the Bard, saying this and that whathave you in the process (I don’t recall or care if it was IC or OoC). In response, the Druid uses that scary paralyzing ability that they have, then proceeds to coldcock the Mesmerist with one of the tendrils from the AS draining plant when they succeed on the save.

I love this Druid, man.

The Monk dogpiles the Mesmerist into submission and the Wibble’s spell goes off, being one that helps keep the target restrained if they’re already being detained. Looking back at the chat log revealed that the Will Save against the Mental Block for the Bard and the CMB for the Monk are natural 20s, and the Mesmerist checks to placate/bluff out of this with their mind/cute abilities were natural 1s. Showing that even the dice gods were sick of this shit.


&gt; The player could understand behavior not being tolerated.

The DM, in character I must add, reinforced that these characters have been through *some shit*, and approaching the party like they have been was doomed from the start. The DM didn’t force any of this, it just *happened*, and the end product of their shenanigans was wearing so thin that the party had no reason to believe them an ally anymore. They were stripped of the buff the Psion gave (Psion’s choice) and placed on a kind notice that reduced their role to something akin to a npc being played by a PC, which they pretty much were at that point.

Out of character the Mesmerist’s player then said we were overreacting. Then proceeded to tell us how fucked our characters would’ve been if not for this and that and boy howdy no one gave a rats ass. I actually muted my mic since my exact words were “This motherfucker right here” in the middle of all this. At this point, the group’s opinion of the player was sliding, yet we did not kick them because we wanted to give them another chance.

THEN the cannon thing happened.

After that point, we all had a conversation for what to do with the pc, and everyone vented their frustrations with the creepiness, as they didn’t stop with the advances toward the Warder IC (despite being, as we found out, a married man. Who referred to their wife in a way that *really* irked me, but I said nothing at the time), and with everything else that happened, again, we were done.

Coincidentally, the player came to us an avowed to do better, and understood that we loathed his character. He talked about rerolling and/or changing some things up, since that was more inline with everything that happened instead of just killing the character. Like fools, we relented and let him keep playing, but they were on thin ice. The next few sessions they essentially sat aside and let us do everything, which considering the previous story is ironic in how refreshing it was.

The party, as a result, progressed deep enough to find Drow casting a ritual to do one thing or another. Seeing a party of battle hardened technicolor horses made them nope out, progressing deeper into the mine, to wit we gave chase. These events progressed into said Drow casting Curse Terrain, Lesser (which had been Widened) to escape, since they were given a large enough lead, and by the time we got there were caught in the thick of this reality warping storm thing. We still had to figure out what was going on, so we progressed further to shut it down. Or tried.

The Mesmerist got up and ran in the opposite direction, because self preservation. It was hard to note if this was IC or OoC them wanting to get killed, but the end result was them being one of the first characters to undergo the effects. Which was to be timeshifted a few indeterminate hours into the future.

Out of character they were back at the bickering while the rest of us were trying move along, saying we *wanted* to get the killed and etc. The session ended in a soft tpk (where we didn’t die, but we were very much incapacitated due to the debuffs and then timeshifting out of existence), and morale was at an all time low. Nobody except the Mesmerist pointed fingers, and everyone was told to get ready for next week, but not to reroll characters.

IC, the mission we had been sent on had resulted in failure. OoC, a lot of us were done with this guy. But there was one last hurrah before they fucked off into the sunset.

&gt; The player was just an asshole, tbh

The following week the Mesmerist is late. I remember this because the DM is a stickler for being tardy, and before they were supposed to be in game they were found streaming WoW. Allegedly their stream went into overtime by an hour or so, but the fact that it took them so long to acknowledge this in front an already far too accommodating party felt like bullshit. But rest assured, they were there for the following.

Those pins? Unpin them.

Our organization quickly caught wind that we were MIA and sent another crew to fetch us. While were weren’t dead we were slowly popping back into existence at different intervals at a site that previously looked like a warzone, nobody was hurt, but people were exhausted and filling the area with the stench of our failure, being told to hobble back to that key NPC’s home when and if we could via Sending and other communicating guff that we had access to. Our ‘backup’ was there and they had smoothed over things with this key NPC somewhat.

The first person there met said ‘backup’, being an assortment of other npcs that looked like adventurers themselves, as per the organization being what it was. While many had unique profiles, the important ones were a ~~Antean Shortleg Earthbound pony~~ Dwarf Fighter with an ornery attitude that was made worse by being brought out here for this, and a shyer Cleric who I remember less about save for what they did and their ability to calm said Fighter. The Fighter and Cleric were the doormen, and ‘greeted’ everyone as they returned, one checking them over before sending them to rest and the other making sure they were on the up and up.

The Druid came back first and had a relatively good experience with the dwarf, since they weren’t threatened but were scared all the same.

The Bard came back next and, on the orders of key npc, was asked to empty their pockets and whatnot. Being from magical Las Vegas, neither npc trusted a magical ex-thief from a place full of magical thieves, and it lead to a slight comedic segment that was meant to telegraph, as the above did. There is a reason for all this.

The Monk and Warder came back and the Warder straight up stepped over the Fighter due to their impatience, leading them to being nicked and the cleric needing to calm them down. The ‘nick’ is putting it lightly, but the player’s character escaped with only a scar and they (both player and character) were fine with such. The monk did not cross any lines and made an effort not to (with their personality, this was definitely fell into their line of thinking).

Finally, the Psion and the Mesmerist. Who were implied to be more catatonic (to explain the Psion’s sudden absence due to a power outage, and the result of the Mesmerist’s player’s lateness and changing their character as wot Changelings tend to do). So the better rested of the party goes out and retrieves them without issue, and the session proceeds as normal for a short while.

Then the Mesmerist’s character ‘wakes up’, since their done with their changes. The first thing they do? Look at the Warder’s scar and inquires what happened. We tell them, and they march right on down to the Fighter to demand an apology.

The fighter who as already irritated with the newbies. The fighter that had been telegraphed, in as many ways possible, to not be fucked with. The fighter that was larger, broader, and holding an axe larger then themselves. And this dense motherfucker wanted to pick a fight them.

IC our characters (those that still cared) tried to stop them with varying levels “Don’t”. OoC we ask if they really wanted to do this, since this is not wise. The player is damn sure this is going to go well for them and uses their Hypnotic Stare when the apology doesn’t come out.

The dwarf gets an AoO and hits. And it’s a natural 20 (we can *all* see this). So, they get split in half, and not in the Darth Maul way.

After a moment’s pause their exact OoC words were “Why did I die?”

Feeling sorry for this person, the DM had the cleric cast True Resurrection on the spot, forgoing the negative levels and everything else (like how the cleric *could not cast that yet*) while the rest of us were are more or less stupefied at this response.

When the character wakes up from being dead, the player asks again “Why did I die?”

When asked, ‘what do you mean’, they proceed to spin some yarn about how they could’ve done x, y, and z, and how the fighter is a murderhobo, and how the rest of us were of no help, and how this came out of nowhere and blah blah blah blah blah. Of all the excuses they threw out, not one saddled them with any blame.

The DM didn’t kick them. They ragequit *the moment* any of us brought up how wrong they were and they realized: No, we weren’t on their side. The past couple of months we suffered with them was not a fun experience, and frankly this guy was the kind of toxic individual that gave bronies a bad name. So once they left the game (the whole shebang), the DM rallied and the session ended after some downtime rp. The characters went back to their home base the next sessions and the Kender pony was went off on their own, for whatever the DM had planned for them.

This was the end for us, but not the DM.

The DM had talked with them out of game, since this guy *was* recruited out of the module maker’s Discord. Whatever was said, and whatever happened later, this person would block the DM on all social media and would later leave the Discord server for whatever reason, presumably after trying to inflict this on someone else. I’m not sure what happened, but after everything I can only guess, since the server regulars are their own eccentrics in their own right, but even they have limits, as we’re all people. So frick.

At the very least, the game still goes on to this day.


&gt; Conclusion

Now, this was supposed to be the end of this, and I was going to go write about some other interesting shit that happened last year. Like, the petulant rapey succubus, the guy that copied/stole my character in the same game were were playing, that one time I DM’d for nazi bronies and they didn’t know I was ‘libtardcuckbetamalenwordpassstickbundleetc’, other fun things I could use to prostrate myself to the holy altar of horrorstoryism. Etc.

...But in the time it took to write this between part 1 and 2, there is now a Part 3.

***Joy***

&amp;nbsp;

What I did was re-install the blue spring upgrade. Last time I only swapped out the spring and piston. After reading a few posts on forums that others ran into the same issue I was having I ordered a 2nd kit and replaced everything. When I removed the regulator seal the oring on it fell apart so I believe that is where I was losing pressure.

[Labeled picture of the parts](https://i.imgur.com/lHST2hf.jpg)

When I swapped in this kit I noticed the new blue spring was 1/16"-1/8" longer than the previous one. My fuel pressure sits at 75-80psi at idle and with the IDP Extreme Street tune it only drops to 60psi. I'm going to give it a couple days and if it doesn't stay under 75psi I will swap the other blue spring back in.

The engine sounds quieter too. I was able to get a motorcraft fuel sender/in tank pump that was just an open box for $120 so I'm going to swap that in to see if it cures my erratic gas gauge.

A Pirate's life for me!  Even being born in Felstrong, the haunting caverns that snaked through the island, and the large stone faces that sung within them would always seem to unnerve him, chilling him to the bone as he heard their ominous tune. In the face of this, he would commonly find himself down there, first adventuring through it with his childhood friends who all were spooked within mere minutes quickly leaving the same way they had entered, with their pants a little wetter than before. Now, it had become a place to think, for there would be few down in this place, and even fewer things in the way of disturbances, and he would be found here should he wish to hide away from his many. A pirate he was, sure, but there were people who lived on the island, and those he had a duty to, as lawless as such a place truly was. In that case, he would only trust those in his small circle of confidants, Harry, Symon, and Edric, men he had known since he had been a child, and helped him in removing his father off the throne.

One of them stood before him now, Harry, always being the smart one out of the group, not only able to patch a man up, but give him a plan of action that would keep the man alive for much longer than he should be. Within the darkened jagged halls of the caverns, they wandered with only a torch to give them a source of light, both men looking down at their feet to make sure they made no misstep.

“Harry, how’d ya recommend I proceed? Felstrong is in good shape, brother, and I think we start eyein’ the sea’s, for there are ships that are in dire need of plunderin’” He chuckled.

“Well, can I speak freely, Jason”

“There will never be a time you cannot, my old friend.”

“Felstrong is a poor island for us to call home. I understand you grew up here, but we should be looking elsewhere. I hear Scarwood is quite a prize to claim. We would find ourselves in a good position should we take it, though we lack the manpower to do so right now.”

“You’ve given me a problem, but no solution ‘Arry. What do you suggest we do about it?”

“Well we raid and plunder as you wish. But we take the ships back here, repair them, and make them our own. When we feel we can crush their fleet, make your claim, and we shall invade.”

“Well, I cannot argue with that, but I never really can with your plans. Speaking of our fleets, I need to initiate some of our captains, try them out and see their worth.”

“Well, the ships have always been your forte, so count me out.” He smirked

“You’re the man with the plan, and a greatly valuable one, at that”

Their conversation would devolve into small talk as they headed towards the exit of the caves, their path winding and snaking, but they had walked this path many times, and they would not find themselves lost today. They light of day would shine through the opening, and their pace would quickly a sliver as they realised they were exiting the caves. Even as men, they still silently believed in many of the stories that existed there. The sunlight would be warm upon Jason’s face, not realising how cold the breeze could get down there, glad that they had reached the end of their discussion. With a nod, the pair would part ways, Jason heading towards the seaside port village, though it's only defining quality of a ‘port’ was the ships that were anchored just off the coast.

Even as the sun sat high in the afternoon sky, drunkards wandered the streets calling out in slurred words, either being ignored, laughed at, or being dragged into a fight. Already a brawl was spilling out into one of the bars, smiling and joining in with the surrounding crowd as the two brawled. His eyes would spot another spectator, Samuel, though important to him as he was one of the captains he was looking for. Silently thankful that Sam wasn’t the one stuck *in* the brawl, he shoved his way through the crowd to get to his target, returning to watch the fight as he neared Samuel.

“You are one of my cap’ns I hear?”

“Aye m’lord.”

“Well, I want to know how good you are at handling a ship.”

“Wot, think I ain’t good enough?”

“Yeah, or at least, I dont think Symon knows how to pick ‘em”

“Well matey, I will show you how to work a ship, I am the best there is.”

“I doubt that. I have two warships, and there are two of us. See where I am going with this?”

“Aye. First around the island?” His hand would reach out

“First ‘round the island” He shook the captain’s hand with a smirk “Get your crew ready, better be ready in the hour.” The crowd around them would cheer, though in response to one of the brawlers knocking the other to the ground, unconscious.

The captain’s eyes would widen in surprise at the little time given to him, before quickly disappearing into the crowd of now dispersing spectators. Luckily for Jason he had already organised his crew earlier, and so he would simply drink at the bar as he waited for his crew to arrive. He would spy Edric burst through the door, the imposing man easy to spot in the crowd, and upon his entrance Jason would stand to greet his first-mate.

“So, I take upon your entrance the crew is ‘ere?”

“Aye captain, on your order.”

“Well, tell ‘em to get on their bloody rowboats, because we ‘ave a race to win!”

Standing upon the deck of a ship was the true home for Jason, for no land could make him feel the same way as he did on the sea. The gentle swaying of the boat, the clamouring as the crew went about their duties, the splash of saltwater as the waves crashed into wood, nothing could be greater to him. At the helm, he would watch as his competitor would line their ship up along with his own, a brief moment of cool stillness would fill the air as he rose his arm, time at a standstill as all men watched in anticipation. As soon as it fell, all hell would break loose, as each ship aimed to get ahead of the other early on in the race.

My new to me 2015 Mustang GT So late in the summer of 2018 I was determined to find myself a fun summer daily driver. I have a nice truck but I drive commercial vehicles and pickups all the time at work and despite the fact my daily is a Raptor there is no denying that trucks are not the most engaging driving experience. I bought that truck 7 years ago because I needed a reliable daily driver with warranty before I bought a house and became mired down with the associated costs involved with that. So I replaced a 2005 BMW M3 (Mystic blue, dove grey interior, competition package wheels) and a lifted 2500 Ram with the Raptor because it kinda checked the boxes of my previous two vehicles and had just the right amount of insanity because after all life is too short to drive boring cars. Anyways back into it, I was originally looking for something along the lines of a C63/E55 AMG but the ones around me had either questionable maintenance histories, dirty carfaxes or something set off my Spidey senses. So then for some reason I was looking at 05-09 Mustang GT's because they are priced super cheap and have a great aftermarket. I drove a few and forgot how fucking slow they were and by time I supercharged it and did suspension and brake modifications I was knocking on the floor of 5.0 car pricing and I figured that was a better play. I had looked at a few 11-14 cars and once again had shit luck finding one that was not absolutely pounded out. So after searching Kijiji and almost giving up hope for the season (mid to late October in northern Canada) my dad calls me saying he found a great deal on a car about 6 hours away in another province. I look at the link and fall in love. It's way way way more then I wanted to pay (I refuse to finance recreational toys/vehicles) but still affordable so we call the guy and set the deal up.

By now you all are probably like holy shit dude cut the foreplay what the fuck did you buy? Well hopefully your expectations aren't too high but I found a super clean 2015 Mustang GT, 6 speed manual, ingot silver metallic and most importantly the performamce package with the 15" Brembo brakes, 3.73 rear drive ratio and track pack suspension. The price was several thousand less then anything comparable in my province and this thing has super low mileage (20k kilometers). The car came with a Roush CAI and Roush axle back mufflers which gives it some real nice thunder under WOT but also won't make the neighborhood despise me. The car is basically fully loaded with the exception of the panoramic roof but to be honest I actually prefer it that way, no paranoia of a rock kicking the shit out of my roof glass. Anyways below is a few pictures. As you can see I changed the wheels out because although the performance pack wheels look nice the tire options for 19" wheels is less then stellar and the factory sizing leaves lots to be desired so basically I drove the car for a week on stock wheels then ordered the new setup and it has sat in the garage since waiting for her new spring debut. I CAN'T. FUCKING. WAIT.

TLDR; I got me a Mustang

Small WoT-themed parody story The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.


Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.


In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose over the Pacific Ocean. The wind was not the beginning.


There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.


Over the islands of Hawaii the wind howled, whistling over the peaks of the islands many volcanoes.


The wind blew east faster and faster, for days and nights and many leagues it raced across the Ocean. The wind flailed over a rocky coastline in the dark of night, in a village called Malibu.


The wind clattered window shutters, and scattered palm fronds all over the patio, of a small well-lit office. A rusty sign hanging over the door squeaked loudly as it swung back and forth in the sudden gale.


The sign read: &gt;!Red Beagle Entertainment LLC!&lt;


Richard brushed a hand through his hair, trying to ignore an aweful squeaking noise outside as a fierce wind off the ocean battered his small Malibu office. Crafting yet another legal letter defending their copyright was tiresome work. With a yawn he stood up, bumping his tea cup intentionally with one hand. This side of the Pacific Ocean did not make good Kafe, so tea had to do. Turning to his colleague Lawrence, who was working late by researching potential copyright breaches on a site called Reddit, he asked "Lawrence, you want a refill?" pointing to his colleagues empty cup.


"Sure" Lawrence replied, his attention on a particularly offensive Reddit user comment which required legal attention.


Richard walked to the small kitchen and turned on the kettle.


Pulling out his short-stemmed pipe, Richard was peering into it and wondering if he had the means of lighting it at hand, when &gt;!the Gholam squeezed under the door.!&lt;

Black Border Off the Coast C.H.I.M.P.S. Guide v8.1 Obyn's OP, towers have been buffed, and although Sub Commander's a no-brainer permaspike and impale are more fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Round number indicates beginning of the round, unless otherwise stated:

&amp;#x200B;

6: Place Obyn in the center top of the track

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/w4icjoz3u0g21.png

8: Set Obyn to strong

&amp;#x200B;

9: Place wizard **(See above for placement- estimate putting a Ninja between Obyn and Wizard. Doesn't have to be pixel perfect)**

&amp;#x200B;

10: 0/0/1 wizard mid-round

&amp;#x200B;

11: 1/0/1 wizard

&amp;#x200B;

14: 2/0/1 wizard

&amp;#x200B;

15: Obyn Brambles

&amp;#x200B;

18: Obyn Brambles during green rush

&amp;#x200B;

19: 3/0/1 wizard

&amp;#x200B;

22: Place ninja --&gt; set to strong

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hgl70b9du0g21.png

23: 1/0/0 ninja

&amp;#x200B;

24: 3/0/2 wizard

&amp;#x200B;

37: Ninja set to first; Obyn set to strong. **MAKE SURE YOU'LL HAVE BRAMBLES FOR 38**, then clench your butt and hope for the best

&amp;#x200B;

38: **Arguably the hardest round in this run. Use brambles when the leads are about to enter your towers' range, and hope it lands near the back of the track. You should be able to catch leaks this way.**

&amp;#x200B;

39: Brambles once the first rainbows start coming out

&amp;#x200B;

40: 4/0/2 wizard. **This one's another butt clencher, but trust in the wizard homing and don't exit til you're positive you'll leak.**

&amp;#x200B;

42: Place village --&gt; 0/0/2

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8i8zhnlqu0g21.png

44: Place village --&gt; 1/0/2

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ij38q4rru0g21.png

45: 2/0/2 village

&amp;#x200B;

49: Obyn Brambles when ceramics come out

&amp;#x200B;

53: 4/0/2 village; **begin Obyn Wall of Trees spam**

&amp;#x200B;

59: If your first wall of trees has not yet popped, use Wall of Trees again and collect the bananas

&amp;#x200B;

60: 5/0/2 village

&amp;#x200B;

63: 0/2/2 village

&amp;#x200B;

68: Place ice --&gt; 0/2/4 --&gt; set to strong

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/euz3stevu0g21.png

77: You'll likely have a wall of trees placed down and another already off cooldown. **The blimp rush on this wave can be killer, so you'll have to place down a second WoT as soon as the first dies.**

&amp;#x200B;

80: 0/2/5 ice tower. If you can't afford this, you've Obyn farmed wrong

&amp;#x200B;

82: 0/3/2 village; place spike factory --&gt; 1/3/0 **(Note: In making this guide, I accidentally put down a 1/3/0 spike BEFORE I placed permaspike. In the end, it didn't really make a huge difference, luckily, but permaspike first is probably a safer bet) (The spike is to the right of the ice and right above the primary expertise village)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8ysy6u1yu0g21.png

83: Place spike factory --&gt; 0/2/3 **MAKE SURE IT'S UNDER THE M.I.B.!** \--&gt; set targeting to whatever will place the spikes the furthest down the track. In my case, it was far, but sometimes close is better.

&amp;#x200B;

84: 0/2/4 spike factory

&amp;#x200B;

92: 0/2/5 spike factory mid-round

&amp;#x200B;

93: Place alchemist --&gt; 1/2/0; upgrade to 1/3/0 mid-round --&gt; set to strong

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/it146e48v0g21.png

94: Place mortar under both villages

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vwi8b6f9v0g21.png

95: 0/0/3 mortar

&amp;#x200B;

96: 0/0/4 mortar mid-round

&amp;#x200B;

97: 1/4/0 spike factory; place spike factory next to M.I.B. --&gt; 1/2/0 **(Note: I'm an idiot. I got a 0/2/1 spike factory in the pictures. Don't try to black border maps while tired. However, still worked out, showing that a) this strategy is pretty sound, and b) the maps I'm doing don't require pixel-perfect placements or micro or anything, and should be doable by the average player)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/u7m8ckzbv0g21.png

98: 1/3/0 spike factory

&amp;#x200B;

99: 1/4/0 spike factory

&amp;#x200B;

100: 2/4/0 ninja, place ices as seen below if wanted

https://i.redd.it/4p8uduzgv0g21.png

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And you're done! You may not get black border first try, but I did this in v8.0 when Obyn's pierce buff was bugged. Should be easier now! Hopefully this'll help someone get black border on this map. I've no doubt it's also possible with Sub Commander (got Black Border on Dark Castle with that) but it's fun to mess around with impale and primary expertise.)

I don't know what to do, this is getting terrifying as hell So basically i've been shy bladder for idk how many years already. The reason i post here is basically due to an event that occured me today, and i can't stop thinking about it.

I just started the second course of my degree so i have classes untill June. Usually i manage to pee when i do stuff out of home even tho sometimes puts me in a fear manner, for example when i go to the cinema, to go out with friends to certain places etc. Ofc i havent gone to a party/disco bar in like 4 years due to it.

But now its literally become a paranoya. Every day day i have to go to college im all the time planning my toilet go.

Today i was going with a friend in car, and we got late to class, but i needed to pee so i told him and he replied "yea i need to go aswell jeez"

So what do i do? I had to do like i was shitting in the stall, and he asked me "wot are u shitting now really?", i said yea , but 1 minute after i reach him at class and he was like wtf did it took u 1 minute?

Same after 2 hours, i had no option that going to the toilet because i knew if i wouldnt go at that time i would be fucking exploding in class 30min after, so when everyone got into the toilet i acted like i was going to the class, and when my friends got out the toilet heading class i was going to the toilet, and 1 of them said where are u going? I obviously said to the toilet...

Idk they surely must think im autistic, retarded have some paranoya or whatever because i act like a psychopath or atleast thats what i think. I have anxiety and cannot get rid of this shit. Telling my friends isn't an option because 1 that won't solve my problem probably and 2, they will make jokes about it and honestly i prefer them to think im crazy or whatever.

Shortly after this bitch noticed, some of my closer friends told me she was spreading rumors. so immatury i fired back with truths. Like that time she buzz buzzed at a sleepover when she thought we were all asleep. Last year she said she was moving to her dads, i didnt know of her bs so i cried and thought she actually was. She didnt. No big deal right , might have been a miss understanding. and then she did it again. 5 more times. in one year. She hadent done it this year so i thought she was done. BOY WAS I WRONG!  Last month she said she was moving to Florida (we are in kansas), But i didnt beleive her. That was LAST MONTH, LAST NIGHT she mesaged me this (exact copy pastes i use textnow on a laptop) You can even see the time stamps (ignore the cameras)

Dark Castle CHIMPS Black Border v8.1 Guide Sorry if the guide is vague/hard to understand :T. It's my first time making one.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xgc9eafkqfg21.png

Who needs Sub Commander and Shattering Shells anyways?


Some notes:


Bottom alchemist was a misplacement. Save your money :)


I barely used Obyn's WOT. I mostly used Brambles whenever it was up. This run does not force you to pay attention to abilities at all really until after R90 (be mindful of 63, 76, 78 though)

&amp;#x200B;

I had auto-start off for the entire run because I made many important tower placements and upgrades in-between rounds. If you think you have fast hands and can buy them mid-round with fast speed off, go for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The number means before the round unless there is a D, meaning during.**

&amp;#x200B;

Guide:


6. Place the left and right dart monkeys as seen above. The middle monkey should be right on the line where the green grass contrasts with the dirt. The middle monkey may need minor readjustments if it doesn't work. Set the left DM to strong, and the middle one to last.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Get a ninja and place it in the middle (see image). Change middle dart monkey to strong.

10D. 1-0-0 Ninja

11D. 1-0-1 Ninja

13D. 2-0-1 Ninja

15. 2-0-2 Ninja

19. 3-0-2 Ninja

21. Get an alchemist right above your ninja, but place it a bit higher than I did so it won't buff the middle dart monkey later on.

22. 1-0-0 Alch

23. 2-0-0 Alch

27D. 3-0-0 Alch

29. Place Obyn as close as you can to the ninja on the right of it (from this point on place Brambles how you see fit).

35. 4-0-2 Ninja

37D. 4-0-0 Alch

40. Place a Super Monkey on the corner (see image).

40D. Place Brambles for extra MOAB damage.

41. Get a village to the right of your alchemist. It's crucial it reaches your Super Monkey.

42. Get your first village to 0-0-2. Place a second village (see image) above your alchemist. Again, it is crucial its range reaches your Super Monkey.

43. Get your second village to 0-0-2.

45. 1-0-0 Super Monkey

47. 2-0-0 Super Monkey

49. 2-0-1 Super Monkey. It is important to note that Ultravision is **not necessary** to buy in this run.

50. Get the second village you bought to 0-2-2

58D. 3-0-1 Super Monkey

59. Get a wizard to the top right of your SM and left of your Alch (see image)

60. 3-0-1 Wizard

65D. 4-0-1 Wizard. Here you can **either** upgrade your Alch to 4-0-2 or until after you get Archmage. I chose after.

80D. 5-0-1 Wizard

81D. 4-0-2 Alch and 2-0-2 on your first village

82. Get a Spactory in the middle of the bridge (see image)

83. 0-0-4 Spactory. Set to close

91D. Get 0-0-5 Spactory as soon as you can afford it. Upgrade to 0-2-5 soon after.

92D. Get an alchemist above your Spactory and upgrade to 3-0-0 and 4-0-0 the next round.

93D. 4-0-0 Alch and place a village under your Permaspike.

94D. Upgrade village to 2-0-0

95. Get a Sniper Monkey above your second village. It doesn't really matter if it's in alchemist range. Try to get it under the influence of at least 1 discount village, if not 2.

95D. 3-0-0 Sniper

96D. 4-0-2 Sniper. **You may want to turn off auto start before starting Round 97.**

97. Set your Sniper Monkey to LAST. This is so he can stall the fortified ZOMG as long as he can so your Permaspike can build up its stack after tanking the first fortified ZOMG. To do this, it is important to **remove the top forest obstacle before Round 97.**

97D. You may be waiting a minute or two while your sniper stalls and eventually pops the fortified ZOMG. In the meantime, get a sub to the right of your first village and upgrade it to 0-3-0, making sure it gets the discount from your first village.

98D. Set Sniper back to first. Be careful. You don't want your Permaspike to tank too much of it (although it will end up tanking the majority of it, hence why you need the stall from 97).

99D. Buy First Strike Capability as soon as you can afford it. Get a MOAB Mauler anywhere if you can afford it.

100D. First Strike the BAD **the moment the ability is off recharge**. Win!

&amp;#x200B;

You're done! Enjoy your expert map black border! You may not get this on the first try. I sure didn't (this was my 17th attempt past round 90). If not, hopefully you at least get some new strategy inspirations :)

Oof... Another knock post. Hey all,

So I'm going to Tahoe tomorrow and was getting things ready.  I went to a buddies house to grab something and he wanted to check out hos the car pulls post Stage 2 so we did a couple first through third pulls. Didnt knock at WOT just did the average -1.41 which Im not worried about.

My biggest concern is that I hit -11.25 right before getting home.  I saw the low at -1.41 before the stop light then drove like a block and saw the -11.25.  This was after a stop light which I read these obsurdly high readings are usually due to some rattling or jerking from a stop.

My DAM is still a solid 1.000.

I know this is probably nothing but with a 6 hour drive through the snow tomorrow your guys reassurances are appreciated.

Do you guys subscribe to the "throw it in the glove box" mentality?

FYI my current build is.

M2.0 Screws + Upside Down PSU = Grenade! A friend of mine (lets call him **AntlerDerp**) is building a brand new PC for gaming. He's been asking me for a bit of advise over the build, but for the most part he is doing it entirely himself. He messaged me (**NGeX**) a short while ago to tell me how the build was going. Needless to say, I'm in stitches from this one.

**AntlerDerp**: "So.. guess what I did.."

**NGeX**: "Wot"

**AntlerDerp**: "Was installing the M.2 last night and dropped one of the tiny little screws and thought it went to the side of my PC case...it didn't.......... It actually fell in the fan window of the PSU..."

**NGeX**: "Oh [word that rhymes with puck]"

**AntlerDerp**: "And I grenaded the PSU. It seems the PSU did its job and protected the rest of the stuff. Already removed the screw and filed an RMA with Newegg. Going to pick up an extra PSU for temp use till the RMA goes through. When the thing popped on startup I almost chucked the case across the room. It's more annoying than anything but man I was pissed last night."

**NGeX**: "Jeez AntlerDerp. You're lucky. It could have fried the new [word describing excrement]"

**AntlerDerp**: "Yeah, I hooked the basic stuff up and confirmed I could at least boot and start windows. Its a bit embarrassing but I figure I'll be able to look back and laugh at it. And it's a lesson learned. Take motherboard completely out of case when installing things with tiny screws...and mount PSU with fan facing down."

**NGeX**: *facepalms* "Oh AntlerDerp... I should have given you the 'how to' video I did a few years back!"

**AntlerDerp**: "In 20yrs of building and modding stuff this is the first major failure I've had. It was bound to happen. Luckily the best buy close to me had the same PSU one model down in stock and on sale so I'll run and get that after work and all will be good. I'll mail out the RMA Monday and when they send it back I'll use the PSU I'm buying for temp as a backup in my other case or something."

**NGex**: "LOL! I'm sorry I'm having a good chuckle over this [word describing excrement]"

Long story short...the dude mounted his PSU upside down and dropped the tiny little screws down in side the fan...creating instant carnage. I would have loved to have heard how that sounded.

EM steals Minecraft Minifigure... Again So...
I was in 3rd grade and it was the carnival party at school.
Me, F and I was sitting on some chairs talking meanwhile the class was dancing and stuff.
At some point EM comes.
EM: Come on! Dance with the other kids!
Me: Nah, we want to stay here and talking.
She takes my arm strongly to make me stand up.
I scream because of the pain, but nobody noticed that.
Me and F pretends to dance and we come back to our seats.
I take the Minecraft minifigure out of my pocket,  the stolen one, that I secretly took back in some way and after some time, EM comes back again, angry.
EM: Why are you still here?!
Me: can't we jus-
EM: HEY THAT'S MY SON'S TOY YOU THIEF!
F: Wot
EM scratches my hands to take the minifigure and F goes to her after she leaves to discuss about the fact of the minifigure, but EM doesn't believe him and wents away with the toy, that gives to EB, that looks at me like it was his.

Continues in 5th grade in r/pettyrevenge...

Entitled mom tried to take a blind kids dog No I'm not the blind kid and he is  my friend, but I'm still a part of the story.

EM=Entitled Mom M=Me F=Blind Friend K=Kid BD= Bus driver


So this was back in january and we was taking the bus to meet of with our friends at a mall, as we was at the bus I looked at my phone checking my facebook while talking to him.

He has a black guide dog, he named him Vladimir (Since we are joking around russia in the good way sometimes)

The bus drive was like 30-40 minutes depending on traffic, and then a kid runs up to us

&amp;#x200B;

K: Wow what a pretty dog.

F: Thanks, I hope it's true if you know what I mean(Because he couldn't see him, and he is pretty open about being blind)

K: Ok, can I pet him?

F: Sure.

So he was petting and talking to the dog as any kid does, like saying yes you so pretty etc. His mom come over to us

EM: What a nice dog!

F: Thanks Ma'am! He's my guide dog.

EM: What is his name?

M: It's vladimir, we like to joke around with russia

EM: \*Giving confused look\* Ok, we have looking around for dog actually

At this point I was not sure what was going on if she just wanted to chat or other stuff.

F: Ok \*Confused\*

K: Mommy can we get this kind of dog too? I like the way they are looking.(The kid didn't want his dog but the same kind)

EM: Sure, what do you wan't for you'r dog? 50$? 60$?

F: Uhmm He ain't for sale he is my guide dog.

EM: Come on I'll even pay you 100$

M: No ma'am he needs it to be guided around.

EM: Come on it's a good deal and we deserve it more than you. He's not even blind I bet.

(Note that my friend couldn't do anything since he was blind)

M: Yes he is and you need to go away!

EM: No this is a good price and I need this dog.

At this point I was anoyed as hell.

M: ma'am leave now

K: Mom stop I didn't mean his dog!

EM: No, these teenagers a selfish and need to give us the dog. \*She tries to grab the dog from my friend\*

M: Get you'r dirty hands away!

I try to push her away but it was hard since I wasn't too strong.

EM: What the f\*ck!

F: Please stop ma'am I need this dog! \*Fightting back as hard as he could\*

M: *DO. NOT. TOUCH. HIM!*

Again she tries to take the dog, the dog also tries to fight back making it hard for EM.

There wasn't many poeple in the bus but she still made a scene. The bus stopped and the driver came over and thank god told her and her son to leave.

EM: But this i not where I need to leave! And I wot leave!

BD: Leave or I'll call the cops.

&amp;#x200B;

She left thank god and the scene was over. The bus driver made sure we was ok. When we came home he told his mom and she was furious! I'm just happy to think/hope that she had to walk a looooong way, but also hope she carried her son since he tried to defend us.

Can a high schooler(16) press charges for verbal and online harassment to another 16 y/o? I asked out this girl I knew for a while, she said yes. And I get a giant WoT from another one of her friends chastising and undermining me in every way he could. This happened 4 times this past week. Is this enough to do so if I can?

"Take a picture of my child and he'll be kidnapped!" Wot? I just gotta have a rant here because after this whole exchange happened, I was fucking shaking.
WM-Warrior Mom
Me-Me

I'm going to pick up cold medicine because my nose is leaking like a faucet. Standing in line behind me are a few teens altogether and WM and her young son, probably about 7 or 8. The kid is going crazy with screeching but I ignore him, y'know? Kids gonna kid. One of the teens turn around and take a snapchat of the kid screaming. This is where the exchange started.

WM-How dare you take a picture of my kid! That's so rude, posting it to your snapchat story. What's wrong with you?

Me internally-Teen deserved it tbh, shoulda been more sneaky.

WM-Don't you know kids get abducted all the time from photos online?

Me internally-*screeching halt*

Me externally-Uhh, actually, most kids get abducted by friends and family. Not strangers from snapchat stories.

WM-Why don't you mind your own business?

Me-I'm not gonna just let you put the fear of God into some teen saying that your child will be abducted when that's simply not the case.

WM-You don't even have a child, do you?

Me-God no, I would never want one of those.

WM-How about you stop being a self-centered bitch then?

Me-Good job showing your child how people should act. Really setting a good example being a warrior mom!

I walk up to the cashier. WM is whispering loudly to her son to not be like me when he grows up. I make eye contact with her as I walk past.

Me-Nice.

WM-How about you get some self-respect?

Me-Flips her off and walks the fuck out.

I'm furious about this shit. My behavior isn't the best, sure. Neither was the teen who took the photo. But this bitch over here is spreading untrue statements just to make someone feel guilty for being unthoughtful with a photo. Who the fuck is gonna see that photo and make a beeline for the Rite-Aid to steal your screeching child? Who? That's right, no one. Because no one gives a shit about your child or where he is except for you.

Writing Smut -Writing Smut-


The evening was cool that night. The stars were barely visible from my window, and the smell of coffee filled the room. In the desk lamp’s light, it was difficult to make out what the room looked like. I knew it was carpet because I’d lived in it for years, but also because I could feel it on the ground. There was a queen size bed in the middle of the room, beside the window. Next to that, on my side where I sat on the ground, was my desk. I could see my friend reading from my laptop screen, which had a considerable amount of…

… Pardon me.

Porn.

And of course some written smut as well.

The sight was honestly rather odd. A guy and a girl sitting alone together in the dark, watching and reading pornographic content. But here’s the deal: it’s for a good cause (I fucking swear I have a reason for it). My friend, Mia, and myself were looking into donating to the local charity, which was running a limited time offer. Said offer entailed donating money to buy food for stray animals. However, the offer only lasted until they moved to another town. With their archaic systems, the organization only accepted cheques and bills, delivered in person. That meant that we couldn’t shoot them an e-transfer, or mail them money. I thought the idea was utter bullshit, but Mia was adamant about “saving the good bois on the street”, so I caved and decided to help. The only issue was we were both broke as hell. Thankfully, there was a local writing contest that was offering monetary rewards. The only issue however, was that the competition was for erotica short stories (to be added to a bound collection).

Mia and I could both write. But the only experience yours truly had in sex was beating the biscuit. That is to say, masturbating alone (being a virgin who's never been in a relationship pushes you to certain limits). With that said, that all lead up to us being in my room, studying porn for the sake of writing porn. “Ah, ahh, mmmm!” was essentially all we heard then. We went through everything we could find: pro, amateur, BDSM, vanilla, hardcore, softcore, sensual, kinky, interracial, and so on. As it turned out, writing that stuff was far more difficult than watching it and letting your hormones spike.

Suddenly, after finishing a particularly intense video, Mia stood up and turned my room lights on. She was rather good looking. Her black hair framed a beautiful face. Behind her square frame glasses, she had deep brown eyes, almost reaching the point of being black. I knew many guys on campus who wouldn’t mind sticking their dick in her, but she wasn’t fap material for me. She was far too random and unpredictable to be a desirable partner. I could see in her grin that she was about to suggest something, so I turned my attention from the screen, to her. She opened her mouth, and practically announced the idea to the world.

“Let’s fuck!”

Despite her oddly eager expression, I blankly stared back and said “Are you stupid?” in a monotone voice. She pouted slightly. “Hmph. Hans is a bully for making a pure, innocent girl watch porn with him” she said. I scoffed at her awfully forced dramatic act. “Says the slut who wants to fuck a loser, and masturbates every night she isn’t having sex.” I shot back.

“What.”

“You heard me.”

“B-but… I’ve n-never had sex.”

“Oh, what the shit?”

“Dumbass, I’m a fucking VIRGIN!”

While she had already been slowly approaching me earlier, she was now on me with the intent to tear my ever so delicate throat out. “Calm down! I didn’t know!” I cried out in vain. I caught a glimpse of her cheeks as she continued to swing her fists around, and saw that they were bright red. For some reason, the notion of her being in the same boat as me was hilarious to my also virgin self.

“Bwahahaha, Mia’s a god damn virgin!”

“Shut the hell up Hans! The only sex you’ve had is with a pillow.”

“Leave Becky out of this.”

“Oh yeah? Try me.”

I pushed her onto my bed and attempted to subdue her via tickling. Alas, she was somehow impervious to my tactics. In a matter of seconds, she was on top of me again, except this time we were on my bed instead of the floor. “Call me a virgin one more time, asshole!” yelled Mia. My face spread into a malicious grin. “Heh… virgin” I whispered in response. Her face’s red glow had begun to match a fire truck’s emergency lights. A quick slap made me regret my decision almost instantly. “Oi, what the actual fuck?” I asked quickly. We paused for a moment. My right cheek was beginning to match the crimson of Mia’s. Except now, she was crying (I wasn’t sure of what the hell I’d done wrong).

“Come on, let’s have sex. Please.”

“Why? Seriously, you ought to come up with a single good reason.”

“I just want the experience, asshole. No strings attached, okay?”

Not seeing a reason to disagree with her, I reluctantly agreed with a sigh. “Fine, let’s do it” I said. To my surprise, she lay down on my bed, facing upwards with her eyes closed. “Undress me” I heard her say. “It’s not like you’re some kind of princess. You can do that yourself.” I meant to reply. However, I didn’t want to make her cry, so I simply bent down and unbuttoned her shirt. Underneath, she wore a cute black bra with delicate floral patterns sewn into the fabric. Her skin was slightly tanned, like high cream content coffee. It was smooth when I brushed it playfully, and I was surprised that there were almost no imperfections on her skin.

“You know, I guess I should be considered lucky that you want to do this.”

“Really? How so?”

“Oh… uhh… I’ve had a crush on you for a while.”

“Is that so? Since when?”

I hesitated slightly before saying “Since seventh grade”.

A slight smile formed on her face.

“What a coincidence. Me too.”

We were silent for a few moments again. As I was about to speak, Mia stood up and started buttoning her shirt up. “Hey, what’re you doing?” I asked in surprise. “It’s no good!” she cried. I was taken aback slightly. “If we both feel this way, then there’s no way we can do this with no strings attached”. Impatient, I grabbed her arm and forced her down as she gave a small “Ah!” of shock.

“We’re adults now. We can do whatever we want, Mia.”

“Oh. Right.”

I stared at her incredulously.

“For real? Did you forget?”

“Mhmm.”

“I swear you’re retarded.”

“So you accepted a retard’s offer to claim your v-card?”

“Shush.”

Carefully, I once again undid her white shirt and removed it. Once it came off, I peeled off her jeans. As I did so, her face became increasingly red, as if somebody were increasing the brightness of a LED lamp. In her black underwear, her body was quite… sexy. She had nice curves, and her breasts were well proportioned (probably a C). I couldn't help but jokingly remark “nice tits”, only for her to turn away in embarrassment. “You’re seriously an asshole”.

“Haha, I know. I’m fully aware of that.”

She sat up and pulled my sweater off roughly, making the wool scratch at my skin. “Ouch! Be more careful.” I told her. With a nod, she more gently slid my pants off as well. With both of us in our underwear now, things were slightly more awkward. “Hang on, we should take notes of this… for the short story I mean.” said Mia. Being the idiot that I was, I declined (or maybe it was a good choice). Even though she’d suggested doing it, Mia was growing silent, probably out of nervousness. I decided I’d take charge, for both our sakes.

“So, what do we start with?”

“Wha- oh! Umm… 69?

“Actually?”

“Yep.”

I lay down on the bed, and Mia crawled onto me. I could feel her breast rubbing against me as she shuffled around, and her thighs sandwiched my cheeks. Slowly, I removed my friend’s underwear, and raised them over my head, past her feet, and onto the bed. On the other end, she did the same for me. “Umm… ready when you are, I guess.” I said aloud. I could see her head move down as she fit the shape of my penis in her mouth. I was expecting pure bliss, like what was depicted in porn. Unfortunately, not everything worked out for me the way it did in porn.

“Gah! Your teeth!”

I bucked my hips up, sending my “meat sceptre” down her throat without warning. “Urgh!” groaned Mia. “Shit, shit, shit, I’m sorry!” I stuttered. Before I could say anything else, she brought her hip down over my face, forcing her clitoris and vagina lips onto my mouth. Not knowing what I was meant to do, I stuck my tongue out and licked a bump between her “lips” as if it were ice cream. “Ahhh…” moaned Mia.

“Did I do dunding dong?”

“Mm?”

Pushing her hip up so I could speak, I said “Did I do something wrong?”

She shook her head, so I returned to licking her clit. Further down, I could hear wet sucking noises, as Mia attacked my dick. The sheer aggressiveness of it somehow made me competitive, so I attempted to vigorously use my tongue.

“Mmm…! Ahh!”

A slightly salty, thick fluid came from her vagina, so I licked it up. It had an odd flavour (like salted caramel), but I didn’t mind it. I groaned slightly as Mia did her work on me. She was a remarkably quick learner. Mia had started pushing my tip against the inside of her cheek, and her blowjob now actually felt good. At that point, I could feel myself getting close to cumming, so I softly rolled Mia off of me, and onto my bed. Her eyes shyly narrowed, and her face flushed red. In an effort to emulate what I’d seen online, I spread her legs apart, and stuck my two of my long and narrow fingers into her. With her already being wet, my fingers went in easily, making her moan quietly. Leaning forward, I used my other hand to caress Mia’s cheek as I moved my lips up to hers. Seeing me move, she closed her eyes, and I kissed her. Our mouths sealed around each other, sloppily letting saliva drip and flow between our bodies as my tongue flirted with hers.

“Nghh… Hans!”

Her grip on the bed sheet tightened, and she kissed me with more passion. My fingers moved faster and faster until eventually, her hip rapidly flexed and relaxed. “Ahh… ah… gahh!” moaned Mia. Her body convulsed as she orgasmed, and her eyelids fluttered. I pulled back from our kiss, and her mouth remained open, letting saliva freely run down the side of her face. “... Hans…” she sighed.

“Oi! Don’t wink out on me.”

“Ahaha… Hans…”

“Wait. Are you okay?”

“Yeah yeah. Go ahead and fuck me.”

“Wot.”

“You heard me. Let’s go all the way, Hans.”

With her face looking like something straight from a hentai, I decided to just go with it. I spread her legs, and carefully lined up the tip of my penis with her entrance. “Wait, Hans. On second th-OUGHT-!” said Mia. Her voice pitched up as I thrusted myself into her carelessly. “Aha! God, that hurt! Mmm…! Fucking hell, Hans!” Mia berated me. “That’s revenge for the teeth, sweetie.” I replied as I pulled my hips out, and then back in. A moist squishing noise could be heard as I thoroughly did my childhood crush, along with the sound of her soft voice. As I put my weight onto her, she wrapped her legs around me, and hugged me tight. Each time I went in, I could hear her sharply gasp for air, like I was forcing it out of her with each thrust. “Nghhh… fuck *ah* me, please!”

“Ah! Hans! Ugh… I *ah* fucking *hah* love you!”

“I… uhh… love you too, Mia!”

“Ah!”

I unrelentingly pounded Mia, allowing my more primal desires to take over my logic. Like a hungry animal, with each push, I used more and more energy. Each time I went into Mia, I had more force behind my thrust. I lost myself in her loud sexual sounds, and gave up my body for her pleasure. I could feel her vagina get wetter as her juice spilled out uncontrollably. I grabbed her breasts and unhooked her bra. Her boobs were soft, and they bounced as I fucked her. Bending down, I nibbled on her tit, and sucked on it. My tongue traces a circle around her nipple, which I felt become erect. As my momentum built up, Mia also moved her hip against me, oscillating to my tempo.

“Notes…! The notes *ah* for the story!”

Mia buried her face into my shoulder, and covered her mouth, involuntarily allowing a few soft squeaks to escape. Like before, I could feel her body tighten around me. “Hold on, Mia, I should stop now.” I said. Instead, she strengthened her grip with her legs, and pulled me in closer. Her body shuddered, and her vagina closed around me tightly. “Gah!” I forced myself to hold back, but I couldn’t. I felt semen rush out of my penis, filling Mia’s insides. The two of us orgasmed together, and Mia’s body went limp. Her legs loosened, so I pulled out of her. She arched her back, and then went flat against my mattress. Her body was completely drained of energy, so I decided to stop for the night. Bringing my face level with hers, I gently kissed her on the forehead, before drifting off to sleep beside her.

“Mmm… Hans. The story…”

“Tomorrow.”

“Alright.”


~~~~~


“Hans?”

“Yes?”

“Do we need any bread?”

“Nope. We just bought some on the weekend.”

“Right.”

I pushed shopping cart along the aisles of a supermarket. Around me, I could hear the bustle of checkout beeps, and people talking. The shopping cart made a funny squeaking noise each time it turned, which somewhat annoyed Hans. His reaction amused me, so I stuck with it. I looked at a price tag, and showed it to Hans. “1.69” it read. As our eyes processed the number, I knew we were both thinking the same thing when we suppressed our laughter. I turned the cart around in the aisle, and took our groceries to the checkout.

Beep.

Beep.

Beep.

“Okay ma’am, that’ll be $45.90.”

I fumbled around with my wallet and handed the cashier the fee.

“Have a nice day.”

“You too.”

I carried the bag over to Hans, who was staring at a bulletin board with community announcements posted on it. There was a hodgepodge of various papers on it, in a variety of colours. One such paper had drawn in Hans’ attention. I traced his line of sight and landed on the words “Literary Contest”. I reached over with my free hand, and squeezed Hans’ slender fingers. We turned to one another at the same time, as if we were reliving a nostalgic moment that we both remembered clear as day. His cheeks lit up in that ever so familiar shade or pinkish red, and I chuckled as I watched him. “Hey honey?” I asked. Hans tilted his head.

“Want to do research for a story again?”

Hans’ face looked like it had in that first year of university.

“You bet your ass.”

Walking out to our car, the dark sky was beautiful. The evening was cool that night. Glancing up towards the stars, I raised my hand in an effort to touch the gems in the sky. The moonlight made an object on my finger shimmer slightly. Under the night sky, it was difficult to make out what was around me. I knew we were in the parking lot because I’d visited for years. Beside me, my husband walked, carrying groceries to the car. “Life’s good.” I thought to myself with a happy smile.

M4A - Made a deal with the devil to change gender, but there's a catch (or three). Hello, my name is Andy, at least it is for now, not sure what it'll be in the morning. I think I've made a terrible mistake, either that or I've had the most vivid trip ever. Let me tell you about the events of this evening.

So, I'm a regular 29 year old dude, average in every way, neither handsome or ugly, rich or poor, smart or dumb. One thing that I have that I'd imagine many don't is TG fantasies. Is it dysphoria or is it a fetish? I dunno, do I look like a shrink to you? Anyway I'm doing some dark web shopping (don't worry, nothing sinister I just need a safe way to getting my weed and coke delivered) and I chance upon a site for 'spells and demon summoning'. Bunch of weirdos I think as I drunkenly search for 'gender change' on the sites search function. I'm given a page with a list of random numbers and letters and told to copy and paste them into several websites I'm given the address of.

Done! Easier than sacrificing a goat, less messy too, I shut down the laptop and wonder what the hell is wrong with me doing such stupid stuff I need to finish this beer and then go to b...what the fuck! I flinch, a tiny petite woman with dark hair is standing in front of me. "Who the fuck are you? And why are you in my apartment?" I yell. "You called for me" she squeaks in a faint voice, "I am to give you the rules of the spell" and then she shrinks into the darkness. A man, handsome and dressed in a tunic and stockings steps out, somehow I know its the same figure just in a different form. "I wilt provide mine side of the deal and thee wilt wake up tomorrow in a mistress's corse, thee receiveth to keepeth 't for seven days. If 't be true thee fulfill the task did set thee can keepeth 't, if 't be true not thy soul becomes mine and thee join me, as thee can see from mine changes I possess many souls" he booms. "What?" I stutter. The figure steps back and reemerges as a fat middle aged man. "Its simple kid, tomawhrow yuh wake up as a girl. Right? I've put de settings at random and tuh give tuh a spawhtin' chance, I've made sure your become someone healthy and between 18 and 50, othuh than dat all bets are off. Okay? Yuh could wake up pretty, ugly, rich, poawh, black, white or whatevuh. Yuh could be anyone or anywhere. Right? Chubby college girl in Ottawa, tired housewife in Idaho, hawhse faced hotel maid in Lima, hardass cop in Lagos, rich kid socialite in Shanghai or drunken trash in Kiev. Right? When yuh look in dat mirrawh in de mawhnin' though, yuh know how easy or difficult it's gonna be tuh complete your tasks and save your soul. Ya' dig?" The New York accent is easier to understand than the old English one at least I manage "What tasks?"

The figure reappears as a middle aged woman with tied up faded blonde hair, its wearing a green skirt and blazer with an eagle embroidered on the breast "First I must explain vhen you vake up tomorrow, you vill nicht only haf a new body but a new life. You vill inherit a chob, friends, family a vhole new identity undt you kannot neglect zis by r-r-runningkt off to komplete your tasks" I shake and yell "what tasks?"

Next it appears as a woman in a ragged dress and clownish looking makeup applied, her hair is frizzled and when she smiles half her teeth are gone and half are brown "In the seven days that yor a girl yer must fuck five lads! Struth! Yeah that's right, thought yer was gonna cast yor wee spell and become some cute lesbian, uh 'uh that ain't the chuffin' way we work 'round 'ere. Might be easy, might be tough I think me mate Fat Guido mentioned its pot luck wot body yer cop. Word ter the chuffin' wise though, whoever yer choose yer end up wiv a fetish for that yer carry for life should yer succeed. Let me lay it straight lad, if one o' the bloody lucky five is a 42 year ole wite lad wiv a mustache then yer gain a lifelong fetish for all blokes like that. So choose wisely, unless yer wake up in a form w beggars can't be choosers! Struth!"

By now I'm catatonic with fear as the figure emerges as a huge black man in a trench coat, like something from the 70s. "Yo! As for dase lucky fahve men. 'S coo', bro. Fahrst once ya is intimate wahth dem ya must does whatever day ask of ya, like, so agaahn choose wahsely ahf ya can. Sheeeiit. Second whatever ya does ta dase men a' whatever day does ta ya chages ya mahnd so aht becomes a lahfelong kink of yas". "But.." I stammer as it fades away.

It reappears as the same small girl. She or it smiles "Cedric, Guido, Helga, Alice and Curtis are just a few of the souls I've collected along the way, you really don't want to join them it's best if you fulfill the task" with a flash of light she disappears.

So, have I got this straight, I wake up tomorrow in a random woman's body she could be anyone and anywhere, she has a life and history, I have seven days to find five dudes to sleep with, I must do everything they tell me to and I will develop both lifelong kinks for what I do and a fetish for the type of guy, if I succeed I keep the body, if I fail I get sucked into hell to become one of her servants alongside Guido, Alice et al...a little help?

Ok I just got back and I’m pissed So this happened about an hour and a half ago
and you know the usual me=me ep= entitled parent and blah blah blah

So when I was taking a stroll/jog through the park and this fat chick walks up trying desperately to take my phone out of my hand but I’m intimidating when I stare down on others because I’m 6 foot 5.
But I manage to make eye contact she freezes for a moment the tries to kick me in the ankle she misses and slips, so I stay calm and walk away but then a kid maybe about 7 or 8 tries to punch me in the ass... yeah I was weirded out too so I move out of the way as I trip him... self defense ok.
So at this point I was annoyed and was ready to take my anger out on something but the moment I turn to walk away the faaat and I mean ffaaaaaaat bitch yells “HEY, WOT DE FOK YO DOIN!” ..... no joke that’s actually how she said that. Ep: why did you trip meh boi. Just going to say this now anything that’s seems like I misspelled something the ep says I did it on purpose because that’s actually how she said it. So I say calmly I did it because he charged at me. Ep: that gives you no excuse to trip my angel! Me: and that gives you no excuse to try to take my phone! At this point she was pissed and so was I and anyone I know knows not to mess with me when I’m angry because I go to the gym every night but not the weekends. Ep: wel geh yo slenda ass ova heh. She says as she runs in for a punch I manage to dodge it and grab her arm then yank her forwards as I pull out my knife that has a glass breaker on the end and then I knock her in the head and I slap her as she stumbles to the ground unconscious I shrug put my ear buds back in and continue my jog. But I slapped her hard enough to the point where it will hurt by the time she wakes up. So lesson if someone charges at you and tries to hurt you then it’s simple BEAT THEIR ASS but if no one believes you have potential in life then get out there and prove those fuckers wrong. Moral of the story don’t fuck with those who can fuck you up.

Thank you for your time.

Power enrichment system/economizer on a carb consideration in cruise First time posting in this sub, hopefully I'm in the right place!  I have a Comanche with an O-540, but I was flying with a friend with a Mooney M20C yesterday with an O-360.  He was setting up in cruise at 10,000 feet and was explaining his power settings.  He said instead of running at full throttle, he pulled the throttle out just until he saw a small drop in MP so that his power enrichment system on the carb wouldn't be active.  In my Comanche at higher altitudes, I've always left the throttle wide open figuring that my leaning would overcome any extra richness provided by the carb.

I've done a little research, but can't find an answer.  Maybe my google-fu is just lacking.

Can anyone explain if the throttle should be pulled back from WOT, or if leaning makes that step redundant?  Both engines are NA of course.

Basically I was about 7 when this happened but one day the awful neighbour boy came round to play on our Wii, he was such an awful person he legit once smashed our teapot once to see what would happen. We go to my room to play super Mario galaxy and there’s a stage where you have to beat this giant witch in that garden dome, after a few attempts I ask if he wants a turn, he does. He is doing worse than me he can’t do it for shit. I start to laugh and he ends up getting a game over, instead of getting cross and leaving “which I wanted him to do” he throws my controls out the window like wot, are those yours? Did I give your permission to throw and destroy my stuff? Me and him get into a literal fight, he’s a little arse but very bad at fighting, after hearing my mum comes up and pulls me off him, she then calls his dad up to come pick him up early, he arrives and he goes home. I go cry to my mum who is kind enough is looking for new controllers, karma bite him in the literally ass when he was walking home from school and fell down a drain, this is no joke he fell into a drain. Emergency services had to come and everything. It also go him when he was standing outside and someone he was mugged by a secondary school kid. Yes I watched it all, no I didn’t help him, I couldn’t play on my Wii for a week and took money out of my parents account because he is shit at super Mario galaxy.

M4A - Made a deal with the devil to change gender but there's a catch (or three). Hello, my name is Andy, at least it is for now, not sure what it'll be in the morning. I think I've made a terrible mistake, either that or I've had the most vivid trip ever. Let me tell you about the events of this evening.

So, I'm a regular 29 year old dude, average in every way, neither handsome or ugly, rich or poor, smart or dumb. One thing that I have that I'd imagine many don't is TG fantasies. Is it dysphoria or is it a fetish? I dunno, do I look like a shrink to you? Anyway I'm doing some dark web shopping (don't worry, nothing sinister I just need a safe way to getting my weed and coke delivered) and I chance upon a site for 'spells and demon summoning'. Bunch of weirdos I think as I drunkenly search for 'gender change' on the sites search function. I'm given a page with a list of random numbers and letters and told to copy and paste them into several websites I'm given the address of.

Done! Easier than sacrificing a goat, less messy too, I shut down the laptop and wonder what the hell is wrong with me doing such stupid stuff I need to finish this beer and then go to b...what the fuck! I flinch, a tiny petite woman with dark hair is standing in front of me. "Who the fuck are you? And why are you in my apartment?" I yell. "You called for me" she squeaks in a faint voice, "I am to give you the rules of the spell" and then she shrinks into the darkness. A man, handsome and dressed in a tunic and stockings steps out, somehow I know its the same figure just in a different form. "I wilt provide mine side of the deal and thee wilt wake up tomorrow in a mistress's corse, thee receiveth to keepeth 't for seven days. If 't be true thee fulfill the task did set thee can keepeth 't, if 't be true not thy soul becomes mine and thee join me, as thee can see from mine changes I possess many souls" he booms. "What?" I stutter. The figure steps back and reemerges as a fat middle aged man. "Its simple kid, tomawhrow yuh wake up as a girl. Right? I've put de settings at random and tuh give tuh a spawhtin' chance, I've made sure your become someone healthy and between 18 and 50, othuh than dat all bets are off. Okay? Yuh could wake up pretty, ugly, rich, poawh, black, white or whatevuh. Yuh could be anyone or anywhere. Right? Chubby college girl in Ottawa, tired housewife in Idaho, hawhse faced hotel maid in Lima, hardass cop in Lagos, rich kid socialite in Shanghai or drunken whore in Kiev. Right? When yuh look in dat mirrawh in de mawhnin' though, yuh know how easy or difficult it's gonna be tuh complete your tasks and save your soul. Ya' dig?" The New York accent is easier to understand than the old English one at least I manage "What tasks?"

The figure reappears as a middle aged woman with tied up faded blonde hair, its wearing a green skirt and blazer with an eagle embroidered on the breast "First I must explain vhen you vake up tomorrow, you vill nicht only haf a new body but a new life. You vill inherit a chob, friends, family a vhole new identity undt you kannot neglect zis by r-r-runningkt off to komplete your tasks" I shake and yell "what tasks?"

Next it appears as a woman in a ragged dress and clownish looking makeup applied, her hair is frizzled and when she smiles half her teeth are gone and half are brown "In the seven days that yor a girl yer must fuck five lads! Struth! Yeah that's right, thought yer was gonna cast yor wee spell and become some cute lesbian, uh 'uh that ain't the chuffin' way we work 'round 'ere. Might be easy, might be tough I think me mate Fat Guido mentioned its pot luck wot body yer cop. Word ter the chuffin' wise though, whoever yer choose yer end up wiv a fetish for that yer carry for life should yer succeed. Let me lay it straight lad, if one o' the bloody lucky five is a 42 year ole wite lad wiv a mustache then yer gain a lifelong fetish for all blokes like that. So choose wisely, unless yer wake up in a form in that beggars can't be choosers! Struth!"

By now I'm catatonic with fear as the figure emerges as a huge black man in a trench coat, like something from the 70s. "Yo! As for dase lucky fahve men. 'S coo', bro. Fahrst once ya is intimate wahth dem ya must does whatever day ask of ya, like, so agaahn choose wahsely ahf ya can. Sheeeiit. Second whatever ya does ta dase men a' whatever day does ta ya chages ya mahnd so aht becomes a lahfelong kink of yas". "But.." I stammer as it fades away.

It reappears as the same small girl. She or it smiles "Cedric, Guido, Helga, Alice and Curtis are just a few of the souls I've collected along the way, you really don't want to join them it's best for you if you fulfill the task but I will enjoy collecting you once you fail" with a flash of light she disappears.

So, have I got this straight? I wake up tomorrow in a random woman's body she could be anyone and anywhere, she has a life and history, I have seven days to find five dudes to sleep with, I must do everything they tell me to and I will develop both lifelong kinks for what I do and a fetish for the type of guy, if I succeed I keep the body, if I fail I get sucked into hell to become one of her servants alongside Guido, Alice et al...a little help?

I modded my Kia Optima and overboosted to 34psi twice before tuning without any damage. AMA 2013 Kia Optima SXL. 2.0 engine.

Have an Injen Intake, HKS BOV and full CP-E turboback amongst a plethora of other mods that don't relate to turbo.

Going full WOT led to the turbo immediately evacuating all air through the BOV and the car dumbing down to limo mode.

When dealership pulled the ECL, it showed I peaked at 34psi. Absolutely no damage or issues. The car needs that ECU tune though, ha.

YOUR HACKING Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile



So this happened about a month ago and thought I would share it here. I used to play fortnite a fair bit until apex legends came out.


I was playing a couple of rounds after work because I wanted to relax, I play on xbox and one of my friends had just left the party. (My party was joinable) I finish a round and win, the last kid was absolutely terrible. For some reason he decided to copy my username and join my party. This exchange ensued.

EK: “YOUR A HACKER, I REPORTED YOU, YOUR GOING TO GET BANNED!”

ME:”ok, do you think it might just be because you are bad?”

*mic makes that annoying noise when it is taken off someone’s head*

ED:”WHY DID YOU HACK MY SONS GAME!?”

ME:”sorry wot”

ED:” YOU HACKED HIS GAME AND MADE HIM LOSE!”

ME: *giggling* “I think its ju-“

ED: “WHAT THE F**K ARE YOU LAUGHING AT!?”

ME: “ the fact that your kid is sh*t at the game and has his dad come on to harass someone who won because they are better than your child”

ED: “FIGHT HIM NOW”

ME: “ok”

*we play playgrounds and I whoop his ass*

EK: “STOP HACKING!”

*i leave the party and absolutely piss myself laughing*

TL;DR
Kid loses in a game of Fortnite, accuses me of hacking,gets dad on the mic, 1v1s me, loses and gets even more triggered.

Don’t get entitled parents into games kids, it’s not fun for anyone.

Will be answering questions for a while.

Possible valve guides seals I've got a 2000, 147k miles, some of those were track miles from the last driver. I've been losing power and burning more oil over the last year, up to about a quart every 300 miles or so. I was told a good sign of bad valve guide seals was if you engine braked down a hill, then gas it at the bottom, if there's a bunch or blue smoke then that's valve guide seals. After doing that, there's a massive cloud of blue smoke and major hesitation/trying to die. I also know bad/stuck rings could be the cause, so I did a compression test last night. Got car to operating temps, killed fuel and power to coils, and WOT during tests. Dry, numbers came out at 2 180 psi, 2 190(I'm thinking previous owner replaced rings or did some block work). I also have a new valve cover gasket on it, so I know no problems there, as well as no symptoms of blown head gasket(like fuel smell in oil or milky oil/coolant). It's got a new pcv valve and EGR as well.

So my question is, should I just be focused on the valve guide seals, or are there other things I should look for? Also, how hard is it to replace the valve guide seals?

[TOMT][YouTube][2007ish] Two girls sing a song about liking and poking on Facebook, one plays Ukelele They sound British, at least at the very start of the video.  Seems like they are sitting on a bed, one of the closes the room door and then sits down, the other says something like "ya wot" in what sounds like a strong British accent but could be playing around.  Then they sing a little song about being friends on Facebook.

A memorable line is something like "you can poke me baby" which leads me to think they are British for the connotation.

Somewhat poor lighting without color balance so the video is nearly black and white, they sing very nice harmonies, it is pretty short, just 90 seconds or two minutes long.

Was on youtube maybe late 2006 to early 2008.

What are some things I could do with my time when disabled but lonely? Long story short, I’m a disabled vet with PTSD and physical issues. I’m in my 30s, no kids, and the retirement/disability pay is enough for me to live off of. Nothing fancy, but with the VA’s help I have a place to live and all my medical bills are taken care of.

I would love to work again but nobody’s gonna hire a mechanic that cant lift more than 20 pounds, you know? My aphasia is so bad I don’t think I’d make it through an interview anyway. And I’ve heard horror stories about the VA bureaucracy stopping or reducing people’s retirement pay if they were found to volunteer or work regularly, even for little or no pay. So that’s out.

I’ve been receiving therapy for a few years now and can walk pretty much unassisted and am finally coming out of a deep depression. But I’ve worked since I was a kid and having nothing to do is something I still can’t get used to.

Problem is, I have no idea what to do all day. I have video games but that’s all I’ve really done besides read for the last 5ish years. My friends and I have all lost touch and moved away or they have families now; I didn’t even bother with social media the whole time I was convalescing. I’m out of touch with everything. I don’t even remember how to use Snapchat. I’m worried when meeting new people that I’ll be seen as weird or boring.

Every time threads like these come up there are suggestions for hobbies that I just can’t do, like gardening, dancing, traveling, hiking, going out with friends, working out, etc. I’ve tried painting, voice acting, built some stuff with Raspberry Pi’s, got a dog, wrote music, RC cars...and nothing is really holding my attention.

I tried Meetup but a majority of groups like to go out drinking. I don’t drink because I don’t want to self-medicate, plus I’m already slow and clumsy. The other groups were for fun nerd stuff, but at the risk of sounding like an asshole, they were just too weird. Not like I was judging them on their fashion or hobbies or anything, but like most of the group shunned me and were hostile to me for not “shipping” cartoon characters. I just wanted to play cards.

I guess the advice I need is two part.
-What are some things I can do in my spare time?
-How do I go about re-joining the world?

I’m super excited to start experiencing life again. I went out to eat for the first time in a long time recently and bought a car. But every day seems so...unfulfilling? I’m sure it’s because I’ve been a virtual shut-in. And I know that’s still kind of the depression but the boredom and loneliness are very real, regardless of mental health.

Thanks for reading my WOT, everyone. I don’t really have anyone to talk to and this has been bothering me for a while.

TL;DR—broken, isolated human in search of direction

Can i finish the nuka-world DLC with the raiders, and without getting Preston to hate me? i'm trying to do the nuka-world DLC, and i want to get to the point where the raiders turn on the main power for the park (which i think is the end), then turn on them and hand it over to the Traders.


I just finished assigning the rest of the park to the gangs (pack - 3 / operators - 2 / disciples - 0), gage mentioned getting the park power on, but first i had to go get a settlement for the raiders in the commonwealth. Sure, fine, whatever, i got 10 charisma and my code name is literally "Charmer", i can secure a settlement without any bloodshed. So i choose to take outpost zimonja, there is nothing particularly interesting around there, and i have nothing built there so idc if i lose it. So i arrive, flex my silver tongue a bit, and soon the one guy living there is sent running, place the pack's flag and, "Preston hated that.", "Preston hates you." *wot, 'n tarnation*


I rush back to sanctuary and track down Preston, he starts spitting all this spiel about how i'm directly contributing to the commonwealths despair, and how he thought he knew me, and blah, blah, blah, he also refuses to become my companion.


Right now i'm sitting on a quicksave that i made right before i convinced the settler to give the settlement to the pack, and.... yeah, title

Does anyone else want an album for every main color? We already have:

**Red: Blurryface**
Orange: ?
**Yellow: Trench**
Green: ?
**Blue: Vessel** (Vessel is **officially** blue, if you go to the merch site and tap Vessel it turns blue)
Purple (because "violet" wot?): ?

I think it would be cool. Our boys obviously aren't done playing music and from Tyler saying his favorite album is "the next one" he must have been working on a lot of songs that didn't make it onto Trench.

It would be nice to have every color match an album, it gives more meaning to the colors we see in our lives.

Personally it impacts me a lot. I'm reminded of Vessel/RAB every time I see blue, so I'll get a random Vessel song playing in my head. I do that for red and yellow too with Blurryface and Trench. It just makes a really positive impact.

hecc i need assistance fellow hoomans i am an ADHD boi and a *VERY* ADHD boi at that.

TL:DR my house is hell and i lack the mental ability to help wot do i do. We aren't in any harassment or abusive troubles don't worry only anxiety and stress.

 i live in a chaotic house where my parents both run small businesses one a carpenter the other a DIY one time use vinyl stencil/decal thing seller/maker. my mom (DIY) is main source of income because dad(woodwork) is too fast paced for his ADHD brain of which i am a clone of. he still pulls in dough, but not consistently enough, and its been a rough couple of months since he got out of being a firefighter for 20 years. he almost got PTSD from it and had to quit because the business needed more attention. my c o n t little brother of whom is a borderline sociopath and demands to have friends over and vice versa is always making messes and i'm too stupid to help out as i sit behind my rig all day barely keeping my a grades up. my house is hell, my family is dysfunctional, and my dad needs help in his tiny little workshop and i'm stuck in the middle doing absolutely nothing helpful by being a retard. WHAT DO I DO? also we aren't in any harassment or abusive troubles don't worry only anxiety and stress.

Story time! This story is about how i almost lost my first kiss when i was 5 , stick with me here :D!

 So when i was younger , there was a guy i had like a H U G E crush on (not gonna say his real name so im gonna call him Andrew) so in elementary(in 2nd grade) i was a very good kid. And my family knew that , so everyone knew Andrew in my family because we were best friends and what not . so just to add this part in : we had a tiny performance in my school , my mom was there , we danced , it was funnnnn. So after it was over me and Andrew walked to my mom , He was like "Mrs. C don't I look handsome?" i was like "this bi-" but my mom was like "how about her" she pointed at me and said "isn't she beautiful?" he said "yeah but im cute too" that was enough to get my little heart pounding.
ANYWAYS , back to the story. I was at a pool party at a towns pool and me and andrew were hanging out, we were splashing each other and laughing. He was like "wanna see something cool" and went in the water , so i did too. We kept getting closer (with our eyes open underwater, just like those romantic movies but mines the reality version) so this dumb bootyhole (myself) assumed that was the right moment and i puckered my lips , shut my eyes super tight , i had a lot of air on my cheeks (not knowing how i was able to hold my breathe that long)  and i went closer , and closer. Until......he fricken jumps out of the water saying "DID YOU TRY TO KISS ME!?" my first instinct was screaming back "NO , you tried to kiss me!" so i ran away in the water ( fyi we all know how water makes us slow) so 5 year old me was trying to walk fast and i kept looking back to see if he was following me , he was staring at me slowlyyyyyy walking  away.
So later on we acted like this never happened. So i decided to tell my "friend" i liked Andrew. And she was like "can i tell this other girl , plleeeaasseeeeee"
"No"
"Come on she wont tell anyone"
"No"
"Come on"
"Fine but she better not tell anyone , or him!" and guess what the other girl did? She told him. :). I mean if he couldnt already guess that i did it would be disappointing. He said (in front of me and my friend and the other girl) "ugh i know , i hate her" i was like "wot" then he walked away. I was left standing there like a moron not knowing what to do next.
I went home i told my sis i (almost(kissed Andrew. She was like "WOT", so everyday for the entirety of 2-4 months. She would threaten me to do things for her or she'd "tell mom" (idk why i told her tbh) , so one day i got so done with her bs , i screamed to my mom "I ALMOST KISSED ANDREW!OK!?ARE YOU HAPPY NOW!" (young me lost it back then :'D) my sis said "I WASNT ACTUALLY GONNA TELL THEM" and i was like "what...:')?" then my dad decides to walk in and give me the "disappointment" look. I knew i was done for.

THE END

[NP] India is A Strange Country by Khushwant Singh This story could also be entitled ‘From Babar to Kenneth Tyson’ because its theme is the reaction to India of foreigners, starting with the sixteenth-century Mongol invader to the present-day European ‘box-wallah’.

Babar did not like India. In his memoirs, the famous Babar Namah, he set down his views in no uncertain terms:

"Hindustan is a country that has few pleasures to recommend it; the people are not handsome. They have no idea of the charms of friendly society, of frankly mixing together, or of familiar intercourse. They have no genius, no comprehension of mind, no politeness of manner, no kindness of fellow-feeling, no ingenuity or mechanical invention in planning their handicrafts, no skill or knowledge in design or architecture; they have no horses, no good flesh or bread in their bazaars, no baths or colleges, no candles, no torches, not a candlestick...."

The English translators of the memoirs went out of their way to echo Babar’s animus against India. The footnote beneath the passage quoted above reads: "Babar’s opinions regarding India are nearly the same as those of most Europeans of the upper classes, even at the present day."

Fortunately, there were some foreigners who loved India with as much passion as that with which Babar and "most Europeans of the upper classes" hated it. It is a curious fact that few countries of the world have aroused as much loathing or affection—it is one or the other—as India. This was as true five hundred years ago as it is today. It is not very surprising that Indians have become sensitive to other people’s opinions about them.

Indians usually divide foreigners into three different categories. Most numerous are the haters who dislike both India and the Indians. Next come the ‘half-haters’ who dislike Indians but like the Indian landscape and the conditions of living: big bungalows, servants, shikaar, polo, etc. The only natives they can suffer are the Gunga Dins of Rudyard Kipling—faithful as their dogs and who know their place. They particularly dislike educated Indians who are either babus (clerks) or, if Anglicised, wogs-wily oriental gentlemen. The third category consists of lovers who like everything about India and the Indians. They find Indian mysticism more satisfying than Christianity; Indian ragas more melodious than Beethoven’s symphonies; the dhoti more sensible dress than trousers; hot curries tastier than European food. They disdain mixing with their own nationals. They learn Indian languages. They eat with their fingers; their women wear saris, put a red spot on their foreheads and say namaste with the palms of their hands joined together. This third category is very small. Indians treat them as the lunatic fringe.

There remains, however, a fourth category—those whose reactions are uncertain. It is the fourth category which arouse the most lively speculation in Indian circles. Kenneth Tyson belonged to this category.

***

I first met Tyson in the bar of the Gymkhana Club sometime in the autumn of 1947—a couple of months after India had gained Independence. I was in a party of friends, a Bengali, a Punjabi and their respective wives. Tyson attracted attention as he entered. He towered over the crowd. He was bald. He limped. And he was the first Englishman seen in the place since the Club had passed into Indian hands.
"First white man in darkest Hindustan!" remarked the Punjabi who fancied his wit.

"Who is he?" I asked.

"Don’t you know Kenneth Tyson?" he demanded. "A box-wallah of the pucca sahib variety. One of the haters, a species becoming very rare in this country."

Tyson limped up to the bar. The bearer greeted him with an effusive salaam and served him a brandy and ginger ale.

"What is he doing in India when all his ilk have fled?" I asked.

"To have one last chhota peg before he puts in his resignation," suggested the Punjabi. "Too many natives about the place for the likes of Kenneth Tyson."

The Punjabi’s wife took up the theme with greater vigour. "You should meet his wife—a real British memsahib, if there is one!" She mimicked Mrs Tyson’s accent. "M’deah, must keep the black man in his place. Give him an inch and he will take a yard. Wot!"

Everyone laughed.

"I think you’ve got Tyson wrong," protested the Bengali. "I had dealings with him when he was posted in Calcutta. Although he did not mix very much with us, he quite obviously liked living there because he never went home on leave."

"Half-hater!" remarked the Punjabi lady. "A half-hater married to a full-hater. Jennifer Tyson does not mince her words. ‘My deah, I’d rather scrub the floors in me own bed-sitter in Tooting Bec than live in one of them ruddy Oriental palaces waited on hand and foot by a horde of black flunkeys!’."

"Poor woman, she’s had a hard time with someone or the other in her family going down with amoebic dysentery," pleaded the Bengali’s wife.

"Occupational disease of the hater," replied the Punjabi. ‘Ever known a lover go down with it? No. It’s always these chaps. They boil their drinking water and drown their vegetables in ‘pinkie’ but the amoebae gets them. It’s the ‘Delhi belly’ or the ‘Bombay belly’ or the belly of whatever place they happen to be in. Then like the Mullah who runs from his home to his mosque five times a day, the hater’s beat is between his bedroom and the lavatory. It is on the antiquated thunderbox that the White man has the blackest thoughts about India."

Tyson turned around; he had obviously sensed that he was being discussed. The Bengali waved to him. Tyson picked up his drink and limped towards our table. "May I join you?" he asked as he pulled a chair from the next table.

"With pleasure! May I introduce you to my friends..."

We shook hands. We pressed drinks on him. He accepted without fuss. "I don’t mind if I do; a last one for the road. The same for me, bearer, please." He had three double brandies before he stood up. "Now if you’ll forgive me, I’ve got my little girlfriend waiting for me in the car. I must get her home."

As soon as he left, the discussion on Tyson was resumed with even greater animosity. "Not a bad chap, is he?" demanded the Bengali who had introduced us. "One must not make facile generalisations about people. He is quite willing to make friends with Indians."

"Now, perhaps," hissed the Punjabi lady. "And with suckers who will go on offering him drinks. He didn’t bother to return one."

"Now really!"

"Oh shut up!" exploded the lady. "Your kind make me sick. Not a bad chap, Tyson; he accepts drinks from the blacks."

No one took up the challenge. The lady continued her tirade, "His woman is worse than him. She graciously accepts gifts from her Indian acquaintances who keep fawning on her. But she will not allow her children to mix with theirs. ‘My deah, it is not the colour of their skin I mind—my God I am not that narrow!—but I cannot bear to have my kids speaking their awful chi-chi sing-song!’."

"I think you’ve got a chip on your shoulder about this black-white business,’ protested the Bengali. "If they do not like it, what is it that keeps them here?"

"Hasn’t found a good job in England," retorted the Punjabi lady. "His wife is out there on a reconnoitering expedition."

The analysis continued. Someone quoted Tyson’s opinion on Indian sculpture: "Them eight-armed monstrosities, you can have them, and with my compliments!" As to Indian literature, Tyson echoed the views of his distinguished compatriot—"One shelf of a library in Europe is worth more than the entire learning of the East. I did not say that, Lord Macaulay did." Indian music "bores me to tears". He could not play polo or go out to shikar. What then kept him in India? And why did he forgo his home leave year after year? Did he have a native mistress tucked away somewhere?

***

I found the answers a few months later. I shall narrate the circumstances which led to their discovery. I was in the habit of taking my dog for a walk every evening. Our favourite promenade was through a beautiful park in which there were many tombs of the Lodhi dynasty. We used to return home before sunset to avoid running into jackals who were known to become vicious during the mating season—and often rabid. One evening we were later than usual. It had got dark; only the domes of the Lodhi mausoleums could be seen silhouetted against the twilight. I quickened my pace and called my dog. The smell of tobacco wafted across the green. I saw the figure of a tall man smoking a pipe and twirling a leash in his hand. When I came closer I noticed his companion; it was a Dachshund. Its front half was inside a hole in the ground; its rear was marked by a rat-like tail swishing in the air. The sound of my feet distracted the Dachshund. It backed out of the hole, shook the earth off its nose with a loud snort and came yapping towards me.
"Stop it, Martha! Stop it at once!"

"Good evening, Mr Tyson."

"Oh, hello." He had not recognised me, but seeing I was a Sikh, added, "Good evening, Mr Singh. Taking a stroll in the park? Lovely this time of the evening, isn’t it? Oh, stop it, Martha!"

Martha scampered back and plunged into the rat hole. "She’s quite happy as long as she has some place to stick her nose into," remarked Tyson, looking proudly at his dog. "All dogs are like that. My last one—I lost her two months ago—she used to do exactly the same."

"I am afraid mine’s a little more demanding in the way of exercise. He’s rather large and we live in a small flat," I explained. The words were barely out of my mouth when Simba, my German Shepherd, loomed out of the dark. He saw Martha’s wiggling tail and applied his inquisitive nose to her posterior. Martha shot backwards, ticked off Simba with a few effeminate yaps and then began to circle around him at breakneck speed.

"Too big for you, girlie! Leave him alone. Come along now, it’s getting very late," he ordered. "Sweet, isn’t she?"

"Very cute," I replied. I sensed that he did not want to linger on. "Good night, Mr Tyson. Come along, Simba."

Thereafter I saw Tyson almost every evening in Lodhi Park. I exercised Simba by doing several rounds of the park. Tyson preferred to stay in the one part which had many rat holes. His Dachshund busied itself ferreting for rodents while her master waited patiently by smoking his pipe and twirling the leash in his hand. There they stayed long after sunset. Some evenings I saw his tall figure against the dusk; sometimes the smell of tobacco indicated that he was still somewhere on the lawn. His parting words were always the same. "That’s enough for the evening! Time to go home. Come along, Martha sweetie." The bitch would extricate herself, cock her head at her master as if pleading for ‘just one more rat’; then have a quick sniff inside the hole, a loud snort outside and scamper off happily at her master’s heels.

The years passed without Tyson taking his home leave. "I can go when I like, you know," he explained. "My leave will accumulate and then I will have a couple of years at one go. Wouldn’t that be nicer?"

"But you can’t accumulate the passage money."

"Oh that! Who cares for a piddling passage!"

After some years people stopped asking why Tyson did not go home. During the winter months when his wife was in Delhi, they did a certain amount of entertaining. In the summer when she was away, people asked Tyson over for supper because they thought he was lonely. He always took Martha with him. He left her in the car: the leash was always in his hand.

The years added layers of fat to Martha. Like all ageing Dachshunds, Martha, who had never been mated, began to look chronically pregnant with a belly that barely cleared the ground. Tyson became more solicitous in his address.

"Nice old gal; she’s getting on, you know. She’s thirteen—which makes her over eighty if she were human. Mustn’t tire yourself out, lady."

After letting her ferret for a while, he would pick her up and take her back to the car. Martha grunted and sighed in the arms of her adoring master.

***

One summer evening I happened to be visiting an English friend when Tyson dropped in for a drink. He let Martha out of the car. Our host had an equally aged Bull Terrier bitch. The two waddled about in the flower beds while we sipped our Scotch in the garden.
"Bet you’d like to get out of this now if you could," remarked our host referring to the stillness and the heat; the thermometer had been touching 112 degrees every day of the past week. "Think how nice it would be in a country pub somewhere along the Thames near Richmond! I’d give my left arm to be back in old Blighty."

Tyson had been through this before. "I don’t mind it, you know! The dry heat agrees with me. Anyway there are all the remaining years of one’s life."

Tyson did not answer. We relapsed into silence. The only sounds were the tinkling of ice in the tumblers and the chirping of crickets. Tyson lit his pipe.

Martha sneezed in the flower bed. The Bull Terrier bitch joined her. The two snorted in unison, then began to squeal with excitement.

"A bandicoot, I bet," exclaimed our host, turning back. "Get it, Flossie! They are a damned nuisance. Come creeping into the house and leave droppings as large as snails. Get it, Flossie!" he commanded.

The dogs redoubled their efforts, yapping and squealing. Every now and then they looked up at their masters for instructions.

A bandicoot ran out of the hole—crying tikkee, tikkee, tikkee. It ran across the lawn towards us. The dogs chased it yapping at a higher and higher pitch. We put up our legs on the table and shouted encouragement to the dogs. "Here, Martha! Here, Flossie!"

The bandicoot turned sharply and made for the road; its shrill tikkee, tikkee marking a sound trail. The dogs ran after it as fast as they could; the Bull Terrier led the chase by a few yards. The rodent crossed the road and ran down a dry storm-water drain on the other side. The Bull Terrier was hot on its scent. Martha got to the middle of the road when the headlights of a car diverted her attention. She stopped and turned her large brown eyes towards the glare. A second later the car had gone over her.

Tyson leapt up from his chair and ran out. Martha’s back was broken; she wriggled like an earthworm cut in half. Tyson picked her up in his arms and brought her in. His eyes were blurred with tears.

His host rang up for the vet. The vet drove up a few minutes later. He examined Martha and shook his head. He took out a syringe from his bag, loaded it with a fluid and jabbed the needle into the Dachshund. "That will put her out of her misery," he explained.

Martha died with her large eyes fixed on her master. Tyson broke down and wept like a child.

I did not see Tyson in Lodhi Park again. A few days later notices appeared on the boards of local clubs announcing the sale of his crockery, cutlery and furniture. He was not going on leave; he had resigned his job and was leaving India for good.

A fortnight later he was at the airport. His English friends and the Indian staff of his office came to see him off. He was his usual quiet, phlegmatic self. He made polite conversation and bowed his head to let the Indians put garlands around his neck. When the loudspeaker announced the departure of his flight, he shook hands without any trace of emotion on his face.

"Well, Tyson, you are off at last," remarked one of his English friends. "We almost believed you were going to settle down here and take on Indian nationality."

"No ruddy fear!" replied Tyson, waving his hand in farewell. "It’s these damned uncivilised laws England has for animals. How can you leave a dog you love in quarantine for six months, I ask you?"

ED cusses me out in a bowling alley and gets booted out Hey guys, I'm new here around r/entitledparents, I heard about this from a friend a little while after this happened to me, and thought i'd share this because of, well, how ridiculous it was.

So, I'm an avid bowler. Every wednesday night I go bowling at this really great bowling alley in my local area. The staff is amazing, kind, I know them and they know me, etc. Anyways, I often like to take small breaks on my phone to text friends, nothing too bad. But the ED in this situation [I mean entitled dad if you didnt guess], was NOT ok with that. So, a little more context, league bowling is on a cross-lane turn based system. You go on one lane and then the other, in other words. So, I will admit I was on my phone when I shouldn't have been on it- but then THIS happened.

I have ADHD and some minor mental issues, nothing terribly bad, just I get a little nervous more easily than other people. I was on my phone and this ED looking like Ernest Hemingway with some dopey striped scarf decides ive been on my phone too much. He comes into the bowling area, away from the seating area, and this exchange happens-

ED: "Get off your f***ing phone you little c**t"
I just stood there like a deer caught in headlights- like, uhhhhh... Wot? Why is this dude like 5 inches shorter than me [i'm 6'1"], and he was calling me a little c**t? That was a HUUUGE mistake.
ED: "Go F***ING BOWL, BOY, OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM"
[Im 16 years old.]
[Also, like half the bowling alley is looking now.]
I started to get stressed and uncomfortable.
But oh heck no, ED was not even close to being done. [ED Shouting] "Youre holding up my son from bowling. HE needs to BOWL, AND YOURE HOLDING HIM UP" "IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT I CAN TAKE IT TO THE FRONT DESK"
All I can think is "Who does this guy think he is?" Then, the beautifully awful puzzle peices fall into place. Three empty beer glasses on this guy's table. I realize what could happen and I reply:
"Nah, I'll take it to the front desk." I walk straight past him, over to the counter. This really nice employee I know, lets call him Brian for the story, asks what do I need, and I say "Uh, this random guy just walked up to me and started belligerently started screaming at me, and..." I jerk my head at the guy's table with beer glasses strewn about, and Brian just kind of nods. Brian knows I kind of have a difficult time dealing with really awkward situations [ADHD etc., like I said at the start]. He goes over and talks to the guy, and the ED shouts about how 'disrespectful' I was being. I said "Sir, you started cussing me out over a very minor issue you could have resolved by just asking me to stop." He continues to shout, and eventually another really nice guy, the manager, [let's just call him Jim FTS], hears whats going on, and Brian and I explain what happened. Jim immediately says something along the lines of "Well that certainly won't happen again, I'm extremely sorry that happened" and goes over to the guy, and talks to him. I go back to bowling [and got my all time highscore of 222- sweet!] and go off to my youthgroup after finishing.

Next Wednesday, Jim talks to me- Turns out this guy shouted at Jim for not punishing me and Jim banned him from the alley for the night- and get this- ED ASKED FOR ANOTHER BEER BEFORE HE LEFT. Jim of course said no, the ED got booted, and that guy hasn't bothered me since.

And thats the first time i've ever really stuck up for myself, and the first time I got a 222! 😜

"They won't make their goal anyway" A little background before I start this rant, I've been addicted to r/ videos for the last week and I was in the middle of one where some EP's took large sums of money from a mentally disabled person. This brought up a thought to be buried hatchet.

Meet the cast

Principal = P

ER = Evil Republican (a nickname in which I gave to a teacher I share opinions with)

ST = Special Ed Teacher

Me = Me (who else)

*cracks knuckles* I'm already furious but here it goes


So awhile back before Thanksgiving 2k18 I was in ERs class which is next to STs class and about halfway through ST comes in with her students asking for donations to The Wounded Warriors Porject and that their goal was $500, one student whos a bit of a doosh but wants to join the military puts over $10 in (it was the bill on the outside with a few stuffed in between) and after the kid put the money in they told everyone to have a nice day and that the fundraiser would end the last day before break. I felt a little guilty at that moment because I didnt have cash on me at the time (my workplace used pay cards aka ghetto credit cards) so I figured I'd get cash back when I would stop to get some fill up my truck after school and then donate at lunch the next day where they said they'd be.

Class ends and I always hang around and talk to my teacher and we started talking about the fundraiser and how I felt guilty for not having cash on me, the following conversation ensues.

ER - "At first they werent gonna let them do the fundraiser because "theres no way they're gonna get enough attention to raise that kind of money, even if I let them they're not gonna make their goal anyway."

Me - So what? Even if they only make $200 that's still better than nothing.

ER - I dont know I'm upset about it too

Me - Who's they? The school board? (My dads on the board so I gotta know for sure)

ER - No I can't tell you

At this point my buddy and a few of her kids from the next class are in the room but I needed to know and I wasnt gonna leave without knowing so this I hatched a plan to get her to say it without saying it.

Me - One blink means no, two blinks means yes.

I start firing away suspects

Me - School board

ER - *one blink*

Me - ST

ER - *one blink*

Me - P

ER - *Two blinks with the smile you get from someone holding in a lot of anger* (if you cant visualize it it's like the "heres Johnny" face)

Me - I can and cannot believe the shit that woman does

ER - You got your answer and I'm mad about it again, dont push my buttons before I put my foot in your dairyaire.

She used dairyaire often and on the surface doesnt sound threatening but usually it meant you got a detention or even further punishment, I did get what I wanted so left without saying anything to my friend and went to my next class. I didnt keep it a secret I didnt give a shit at this point, she treats them like janitors and doesnt give a shit about them then she does them dirty like that? It doesnt hurt anyone for them to go around asking for donations, nor does it take any effort to give them a shout out during her 15 minute long morning announcements  in which she only talks about.... we dont know what she talks about really, our school meme page has her face on the drake meme that goes along the lines of "regular morning announcements" *shakes head no* "some fuck shit idk" *nods in approval*. At that point I started bashing P in every class every hour of the day, I remember during freshman yr I was wearing my hockey teams jacket and P comes in looks at me and says

P - I didnt know we had a hockey team (in a slightly disgusted voice)

Me - yeah we do, we beat (an unnamed private school in which we have a 40 yr long rivalry)

P - that's cool

She then left the class and I was surprised of how utterly fucking stupid can a person who has the Prefix Dr. be?

Anyway back to the main story, after shit talking P in every class for a few days I completely forgot about donating because I'm dumb like that. As fate would have it P comes on the intercom and I IMMEDIATLY get furious and remember what she had done to the special ed students, after Ps yammering about some bullshit I ask ER if I can visit next door. She let's me go because I'm cool with her like that and she let's me go. I walk fast in general but I was in a different gear at that moment I walk into that class and ask ST where they're at with their goal, her face gets a little sad and writes it down on paper and hands it to me. They need roughly $300.

Me - Youre almost there! (I say this because I dont wanna make the class sad/upset)

ST - *with a doubtful smile* Yeah heh, we got this in the bag.

She said it with such a tone of defeat and regret that she had let her students down I couldn't let my fucking cunt of a Prinicpal be right. I sit through last period thinking of what I'm gonna do which didnt take long to figure out, I pull out my phone and check how much I've got on my debit card. I've got $250, furious with myself knowing I wont get paid for another week I once again go back to the drawing board. I text my gf and ask her how much she has on her card.

GF - Uhh like $400, why?

Me - Remember how I told you about P and the special ed kids with their charity? I'm a little short can you chip in toooooooo?

GF - How much?

Me - I mean liekkkk only $100

GF - WOT

Me - I'm short $50 but I gotta get gas after school

GF - I dont knowww that's a lot of money ykk

Me - I'll take your closing shift tonight and tomorrow night

GF - Still that's a lot of money dooddd

School ends and we get back to my truck and once we get in the same conversation happens IRL.

Until were at a stop light and she sees a person walking a dog waiting for the right of way.

GF - Doggyyy

A light bulb goes off in my head, she LOVES dogs and I knew I found a way to help her donate. I wait until a few minutes later right before I drop her off at home I ask her again.

GF - I cant that's too much money broski

Me - But what if it gets a blind veteran a service dog

She starts crying and I get a shit eating grin on the inside (dont hate me it's for a good cause)

GF - Awww Its gonna be a happy doggy with a bandanna and its gonna have it's own uniform like his ownerrr

Me - I'll let you think about it some more I'll pick you up in a bit for work

GF - Okayyy see you then

I pick her up and we go to work and like I said I would I closed for her and the next morning we went to a drug store to use their ATM and I got my $200 and she got her $100 and then we headed off to school, I'm not at school in the mornings because I go to a vocational school for welding and we come back before lunch but they weren't there at lunch so I waited till I got to ERs class to donate since its next door.

When I get to ERs clas theres a bitchy sub but she reluctantly let me go STs class to donate. I walked in like a runway model strutting my dirty ass boots with my greasy hair and unshaven neckbeard and I ask ST how much they need.

ST - Same as yesterday but were still close! (Once again with her fake smile and defeated tone)

Me - Alrighty let me see what I can do

I pull the money out and untie the rubber band and start counting off

Me - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, one

She was shookith

Me - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, two

More shiokith

Me - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, three

I then proceed to put it their little box for donations and tell ST that a certain someone wasnt gonna be let off easy for this I then proceed to mouth Ps name

ST - Nonono it's fine heh dont worry about it it's no big deal

I could tell she was a little paranoid but I was sick and fucking tired of her treating the mentally disabled like slaves then shutting them down like that never giving them the time of day I was done with her shit. I proceed to hand her my dads card that has his school board email and phone number on it and I tell her if anything like that happens again P will have to answer to the board.

I walk out like a pimp and then my now broke ass went on with my day feeling better about myself knowing that I had said a big fuck you to my principal. Saying that they are capable of what they set out to do, granted I know most likely it wont happen again but cross me like that and I'll hound your ass. I've got a soft spot for the mentally disabled, ever since I was young my dad has done charity for them and a lot of them I actually know from the charity event we do for them. I cant stand seeing shit like that, when I get going like that I'm like a pissed off bull in a world full of red.

A few more reasons I hate my principal is because if you're in the basic lower difficulty classes ZERO fucks are given about you, she'll hang out at lunch with all the AP and Honors kids but if you're not in those classes she will not give you the time of day nor will she ever acknowledge you any other time in the hallways and such. On a smaller scale and going back to the whole hockey thing from earlier we had beaten the unnamed private school back to back on multiple occasions and whenever we ask to have our games put on the morning announcements but she always manages to "forget" or get this "not have enough time". Yeah yeah whatever fuck you too I'll do shit on my SAT because you dont believe in us so why should we believe in ourselves? You treat me like dirt I'll make you look like shit bitch this is a "give respect get respect environment" your fuckin words not mine all I do is live by them. But what the fuck do I matter to you I'm just some dirty welder who doesn't know anything.

PS yes my gf and I talk like that and yes I know I kind of took advantage of her love of dogs but it wasnt in vain and this past xmas she got a lot from St. Nick (my actual name) including a giant stuffed dog which FYI she loves a lot. Also some parts sound generic but I had to fabricate some of what other people said because of my rage induced hormones and testosterone fogged my memory up but 90% of it is what actually came out of the everyone's mouth. I've been writing for an hr and a half but it's all worth it, hopefully this doesnt get taken down because its mosty a story but I think it has enough ranting in it to stay on the subreddit. No chances are being taken I'm gonna copy the whole dsmn thing and save it to a notepad. Thanks for reading :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

hi im new here and this is my 1st poast. plz exuse my spelling cos i have dyslexia and am only 13. ok so names are BT=bitch teacher, C=friend 1, EZ=friend 2, O=friend 3 and E=me. only me and O were doing P.E.

&amp;#x200B;

ok so this was on friday in scool and its sunday now. so i got to P.E with my planer out so BT cud see the note that my mum rote that asked if i cud not do any running/sport that cud twist my knee that had been bad for 3 weeks and she knew this and let me off the uther time that she taught my class (she taught us once a fortnight on fridays). i showd my note to witch this coversation unfolded.

&amp;#x200B;

BT: "ok so you CAN run but you are just to lazy so you got a note to exuse yourself from this"

i wos anoyed bicos she let a girl off with no note who didnt have enything rong with her. i responded with

E: "so..what should i do in this leson"

while trying to keep my cool and not let my ADHD and autisom get the best of my patiance.

BT: "just go get your kit, get changed and you can play the football match."

E: "but i ha..."

cue death stare from BT.

BT: "just do it now"

&amp;#x200B;

i sighed and left to get my PE kit, came back and got changed. we took a redister then went outside to get the equipment for football. bare in mine i wos limping relitivly bad. the leson went ok bicos my friends were on my team and let me go in goal so i didnt have to run or move a lot. it all went desently bisides the fact my teatcher yelled at me for not running laps at the start or the leason and not running or doing all the running across the pitch to get the ball. so it got to about 3/4 of the way thrue the leson wen a girl on the uther team started yelling at me and being a complete jack ass towards me. then out of nowar the football (that wos verry hevy) hit me on my bad knee and bounced about 10m away. all 3 of my friends ran over to me as i wos tearing up. C and EZ helped me walk out of the pitch. i sat outsind against the bike shed still in floods of tears bicos i wos in so much pain wen the BT ran over to me looking fed up and yet anuther yelling fit ensued.

&amp;#x200B;

BT: "WHY DID YOU LEVE THE PITCH YOUR SUPOAST TO BE DOING P.E!!!"

C: "dont wurry E you'll be ok just breth"

BT: "ARE YOU IGNORING ME!!??"

EZ: "yes"

C: "E lets go to the other side of the shed and you can calm down"

E: "o-ok"

&amp;#x200B;

we left to the uther side of the shed bicos i hate peple bicos soshel angziaty. we went to the uther side of the shed with C and EZ supporting me to try keep me upright. O came over to us and we filled her in on wot happend. we got up, went to the changing rooms from just outside the pitch but to get to the changing rooms we had to walk past the P.E suplly cubord with BT. we got level to her and she spun like the exersist just so she cud start yelling at me and my friends. it went like this.

&amp;#x200B;

BT: "why are you limping?"

C: "bicos \*explanes about the note and the ingery\* and you made her do football"

BT: "well she cud of just sat out"

O: "no...bicos you sed no and you yell at peple who dont lisen to you so thqats why and suck it"

BT: "we you shud just but out of it biocos this is non of your bisnes so go inside and shut up"

O: (looking pissed) "well im making it my bisnes bicos shes my best friend so YOU have no right to tell us what to do since you caused this"

BT: "all of you inside NOW!!! E stay here we need to talk"

&amp;#x200B;

i noded to O and C to go inside but EZ stayed with me to keep me upright.

&amp;#x200B;

BT: "i sed all of you. so that meens you EZ. just bicos your blond dusnt meen that the rules dont aply to you"

&amp;#x200B;

EZ looked at her and yelld that just bicos she is blond dusnt meen that shes dumb and that all of my friends are smarter then her and she shud shut her mouth. with that she went inside to get my backpack, came back to me and we heded off

Obnoxious highschool class on train Not native speaker, mobile etc.

Also i like swearing.

I attend college in a city that is a 2,5 hour train ride away from the city where my parents live. And no this is not an everyone clapped story but rather an "everyone groaned in pain on the entire ride thanks to what I'm guessing was a highschool fieldtrip" story.

One weekend me and my girlfriend  were travelling back to my hometown. We were travelling with a train that was seat reservation only with no first class, so what can go wrong, right?

As we are getting into our carriage we can already hear the noise a tipical highschool class  makes. As we were searching for our seets I notice that most of the people that didn't belong to the class were looking at us pained faces. We get to our seats and surprise, they were taken by the /s nicest, most polite, most mature /s galls there ever been.

Lets set the stage:
Me: Me
Girlfriend: GF
Highschool girls:  HLS for highschool ladies as I dont recall which one said what
Their male classmate: B
Their teacher: T

Comments by the  serial killer in my head are marked with **


GF: Sorry these are our seats.
HLS: Yeah I know *wtf why are you not standing up then?*, but you can find other seats as we don't want to get up every time we sit in someones seat *b-tch what?*
Me: Why don't you sit in your reserved seat then?
HLS: Becouse they are in an other carriage and we want to sit with our classmates. Sit somewhere else. *forgot the magic word twat, and I don't want to move around every time either*
Me: Tell you what, tell me where your seats are and we will sit there.
HLS: Dunno. *Wat*

Waiting for her to continue but apparently case closed for her.

Me: Who knows then?
HLS: Our teacher.

Another pause. They start talking with each other. Mind you there didn't seem to be anything wrong with her mental capabilities, she was just being a twat. *Wtf is wrong with her head? Do I need to treat her like a five year old?*

Me: Where is she/he?
HLS: Over there.

I go over to the teacher, starting to get seriously ticked off. My gf doesn't like confrontation, and is a bit afraid of people in general so she waits.

Me: Excuse me.
T: What *Don't what me mate, I'm not in the mood*
Me: Some of your students are sitting in our seats, can you please tell me where they sit?
T: Dunno *veins pop* here are all of our tickets, choose two seats and sit in them.*u wot*

So I look through the 35 or so tickets trying to find two that are next to each other. Mind you the seat numbering system in my country is pretty shit so it isn't easy to know which are next to each other. Plus me and my gf are studilying IT engineering. Which means tons of homework on laptops so I intentionally reserved seats with table.

Turns out only ten or so are actually in this carriage the rest are spread all over the fucking train. So it turns out someone in their school fucked up and forgot to reserve seats for a class trip early and they just took the entire carriage and made everyone sit elsewhere, thats why everyone else was looking pissed off. And they didnt even have the courtesy of playing switcheroo till the carriage was full, they just sat where they pleased and let the rightful owners of the seats deal with the rest.

So now if I want to deal with this quietly I have to take a photo of every fucking ticket or memorise the numbers and go through the entire train to find one empty (becouse the owners of the tickets in this carriage must sit somewhere too).

Nope.

Me: Sorry but you must ask them to move *i aint paying for your fuckup*
T: Dont wanna, do it yourself * ima murder you brah*

I wasn't keen on the idea of arguing with two much younger girls be as they were. But seeing as the teacher wont lift his ass to help I decide little ol' 5'6 me isn't that traumatizing.

Going back to the girls.

Me: You need to move or I'm calling a ticket man.
HLS: But we don't wanna. *inernally screaming*
Me: That is not my problem.

This is where B stands up:
B: We give them our seats and we will stand through the ride *my man!*

So in the end we got to enjoy our ride in our seats, with loud highschoolers and pissed of passengers.

ESH except GF and B.

I got scared while robbing a house (please help) Hey. I know a lot of people are gonna judge me but i need to get this off my chest. I want to inform you that I dont live this life anymore but this story has haunted my nightmares every single day. I was super poor growing up and my mum never cared about me. which lead me down a path of pure destruction. I needed money and i needed things to pawn so I started to rob houses. yes tell me im wrong cause I was . It was an inhuman thing to do to people who have maybe the same life as me. but hey, dog eat dog world right? One night I had decided to rob a house with a little girl in it. but she would be asleep and i would never do anything to hurt the family or people that I robbed. I couldnt live with myself If i ever had. anyways I waited till all the lights went off and the parents went to bed before I snuck in through the dog door and did my best to be quiet. I knew what I was doing was wrong  but i needed money. I stole a few things such as the TV and the jewelry which was on the mantel. I forget to mention that this was the rich neighborhood right across from my ghetto ass apartment complex. So it was easy to say that this place had a lot of stuff that was pawn-able. jackpot i guess.I was in the middle of my looting when I started to hear noises down in the basement. For all I knew the only people that lived here was the all to perfect mother, the father who could probably buy my soul, and there adorable daughter. I froze in the darkness as the sounds got louder. I couldnt risk getting caught, and I should have just left. but of course, you know how this goes, curiosity got the best of me and I slowly opened the door to the basement. immediately the sounds got louder and it sounded like a banging. as if someone was kicking the wall over and over. I was a girl that didnt fear anything due to me thinking that ive seen it all. So you guessed it. with my balls of steal I walked down to the basement. It was pitch black and the noise was incredibly loud. i flipped the switch and immediately the noise stopped
"well thats strange" I whispered to myself and flipped the switch back off and the noise instantly started again. Now I have to admit at this point my arms were getting goose bumps. I turned to head back up the stairs when I heard crying from the other side of the room.  I turned back on the light to see the little girl tucked into the corner. (I wot be revealing her name or the location for obvious reasoning) I knew i wasnt supposed to be there but the way she was silently sobbing made me want to help her. I slowly walked over as she looked up at me putrefied.
"shh its ok whats wrong" I asked her. I know creepy. But listen she looked mortified.
"dont you see it too?" she replied through tears and sniffles. I swear every bone in my body shattered and I felt like jellie.
"see who?" I asked trying to see what she means. I was scared now and honestly wanted to curl up with her and cry.
"The black man. he drags me down here every night and scares me and then takes me back to my room." She said with a pale face of pure fear. I shook violently when the lights flicker. I wanted to cry so bad. But I was scared, yet determined to get this girl out of here. this was all too real and I couldnt even thing about robbing this place anymore. all I could think and All my gut was telling me was to grab the girl and run upstairs. so thats what i did. I grabbed the girl and run up the stairs slamming the door. I woke up the parents immediately and the rushed downstairs screaming. I mean If you saw a girl you didnt know holding your daughter and slamming doors in your house you would be pretty spooked. I tried to explain but I knew it was no use. Long story short I was sent to jail and had a court hearing. The parents and little girl showed up and the parents kept telling the little girl to say exactly what happened. She kept looking at the parents confused as the dad spoke about me breaking in. I didnt care if I went to jail. I had it coming always. the little girl spoke.
"she saved me. " she said as her mother immediately interjected
"what she means is that she grabbed her with no warning" but me and the little girl made eye contact with eachother knowing what happened. I cant help but wonder she saw in the basement. I knew something was there, something evil, something that could do more harm than a simple robber. I was 16 when this all happened and I am now 24. I no longer rob houses if your wondering and actually live a pretty decent life but this still haunts me. can anyone tell me what the fuck couldve happened? I want to meet with her again and if I ever do I will post it so please, help me figure this out.

Mom Steals Her Child's Birthday Money My friends told me to post my stories from my job here so I hope this is the right subreddit owo

Background: I work in a children's party boutique (like Chuck E. Cheese but for girls). We host parties for girls, usually age 3-11. The "parties" are two hours long and the first hour is designated for spa services, and the second hour is dress-up, food, and cake.

The first red flag was that the girls were all 12-13.  We try to accommodate girls but the furniture is child sized, so if they don't fit, they DON'T FIT!!! So we were immediately being chewed out because everything was "too small." And of course, they showed up late, plus they added a service which would take up even more time.  Annoying, but whatever, it's our job.

Then EM tells my boss she wants to add candy to the treat bags we supply.

Boss: Okay, you can give the candy to the girls and they'll put it in the bags for you!
EM: (shoots us a look and walks over to the bags herself)

I guess she thought we would steal her candy because we all look young, because she would NOT let us help set up the bags, which wasted even more time because we couldn't get started.

The first outright rude thing EM said went as follows-

Me: Do you want us to use all the candy or just give each girl a few each?
EM: I don't care, just put it in!!
Me: :))))

So whatever; she was grumpy. I deal with mean people every day and I know how to ignore it.

But after two hours of rudeness and entitlement (putting her purse on our chairs, using the children's chairs to sit, etc), she did the worst thing I've ever witnessed at my job.

She was ready to pay and I was just across the room waiting for the kids to get their shoes on so I could hand out the gift bags.  I glanced over at her and noticed she pulled an envelope out of her waistband.  She pulled out a birthday card and pulled a stack of cash out of it, then did the same with a few other cards. All of this with her back turned to the kid who was busy eating.

Yeah, she payed with her CHILD'S BIRTHDAY MONEY. She payed ~$450 with her 12 year old's birthday money, and then stuffed the rest of the money in her bra to hide it.

Then she handed the empty cards to her kid, and never mentioned the money.

I was completely baffled and grossed out that she would steal from her child. She felt that because she let her kid have a party that.. the kid should pay for it..???? Wot?

This isn't a typical "my precious baby deserves your item!!" story because the mom was entitled AGAINST her own child but I hope it still qualifies as an EP story :)

YOU GASLIGHTED ME... WOT I'm new to this and this is my first post so I don't really know where to put it. I do not know if this belongs in this subreddit.

Hi there some background, I have struggled with anxiety and depression for quite some time now. Even though I look and act like I'm good at talking, inside I'm actually dying. I thought I was friends with this girl in the beginning.

So I met this girl lets call A, she seemed nice and we connected over our anxiety and eating disorders (I'm not currently participating in these activities.) She opened up to me almost immediately and tells me all the dark stuff about her life (not going to share). Fast forward a few months and I have come home upset and panicking about this girl and her health, I went to so many people and I felt like they were doing nothing to help [her mental health] and she was going to get really hurt. My parents found out how stressed I was and told me to stop talking to her, so I did. I did not convey anything to A that she was doing something wrong. One day I swiped up on her ig story and told her stuff that I now regret. I used quite a bit of profanity and could have phrased things a different way, later she involved all of our friend group and kept spreading lies about me. She told me that I ghosted her while I knew she had social anxiety. At an assembly, she asked someone on stage a question, "what do you do when a person you trusted stabs you in the back. And all I could think was BITCH. All of my friends were telling me to talk to her face to face so we could see each other sides, I agreed to this even though my parents did not. She wouldn't do it because honestly, I do not know. She and I were talking over text again (I know a bad idea) and she told me that I was gaslighting her.
For those who do not know here is a definition. "manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity."
..........
THE FUCK
I mean ghosting was a little bit of a stretch but gaslighting?! Before that and After that she was posting things on her ig story about me and how I was such a bitch, she posted them on my birthday too! (we have the same birthday) I told her to take them down and she said they were doing me no harm because they didn't even have my name on it, how do I even know it's me. Eventually, she gets reported to the school about her ig and she blames me. I told her it was not me and she believed me, she was reported for fat shaming and for bullying. She then deleted her Instagram, but makes a new one. I found it because ig recommended it to me along with other Instagrams. Her profile says it all, it basically says that due to people being rude her account is invite only....... Wot. She keeps checking my Instagram stories and thinks I don't see it. When all of a sudden I get a DM from her dogs IG. When we were still friends we had a dog sleepover and I had taken videos on her phone of my dog playing and posted them on my dogs IG from her phone, that means I had to log in to my dogs IG on her phone. Once the dog sleepover was over I highlighted it on my dogs Instagram. Even after we were not friends I kept it up there because I did not have the videos on my phone of my sweet dog playing. She then asked me to take down the posts and me being petty I said no. She then said well then I will remove them myself. She then proceeded to go onto MY Instagram account and DELETE the videos off of MY Instagram. BITCH WHEN DID I EVER GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO GO ONTO MY INSTAGRAM AND DO ANYTHINgG?!?!?!?!?! She said it was a violation of her rights because it was her property and she could remove it because she wanted to. I will never get back those videos of my dog having fun with other ogs, I don't even care that it was at her house I just like seeing my dog happy. Now there really isn't a ending to this story because the part about my dogs instagram just happened about a hour ago but thats my story so far. I'll try to but updates but, A if you're reading this...... FUCK YOU.

Do Americans respond to thankyou differently? So today I was walking home and this couple with a small child were walking Infront of me and being the polite British person I am, I just slowed down behind them and the male turns to the female and in a quiet distinctive American accent goes "let him pass, we're pretty slow" they then stepped to the side of the path and I passed. Obviously I said thx and the guy responds "no you're fine" I have never heard this before in my life and at first it sounded like he was rejecting my thanks so I thought to myself you fooking wot mate but said nothing coz I'm British. Is this a normally occurrence? was he being a passive aggressive cunt?

Family friend: You are now eligible to date my daughter. Me: wot? Thanks everyone for being here to read my stories about the ridiculousness of Asian parents.

Me: 27M, Chinese-American, did undergrad in engineering at Berkeley, work in tech in Silicon Valley. To top it all off, I was just accepted to medical school (my choice, not my parents's).

Well, my folks couldn't keep their mouths shut, and a family friend, lets call her Jane, found out about my new career and reached out to me. Jane has a daughter about my age, (allegedly?) single and doing a PhD in biology at a top school. Jane asked me if "I was interested in being set up with her daughter." I asked, "Why me?" Her answer stunned me.

She said, "**Now that you are going to be a doctor, you are now educationally on the same level as my daughter, and thus eligible to date her**." I politely said I'd think about it and hung up. Good thing my school is far away and I doubt I'll ever see Jane again.

M4A - Made a deal with the devil to change sex but there's a catch (or three). Hello, my name is Andy, at least it is for now, not sure what it'll be in the morning. I think I've made a terrible mistake, either that or I've had the most vivid trip ever. Let me tell you about the events of this evening.

So, I'm a regular 29 year old dude, average in every way, neither handsome or ugly, rich or poor, smart or dumb. One thing that I have that I'd imagine many don't is TG fantasies. Is it dysphoria or is it a fetish? I dunno, do I look like a shrink to you? Anyway I'm doing some dark web shopping (don't worry, nothing sinister I just need a safe way to getting my weed and coke delivered) and I chance upon a site for 'spells and demon summoning'. Bunch of weirdos I think as I drunkenly search for 'gender change' on the sites search function. I'm given a page with a list of random numbers and letters and told to copy and paste them into several websites I'm given the address of.

Done! Easier than sacrificing a goat, less messy too, I shut down the laptop and wonder what the hell is wrong with me doing such stupid stuff I need to finish this beer and then go to b...what the fuck! I flinch, a tiny petite woman with dark hair is standing in front of me. "Who the fuck are you? And why are you in my apartment?" I yell. "You called for me" she squeaks in a faint voice, "I am to give you the rules of the spell" and then she shrinks into the darkness. A man, handsome and dressed in a tunic and stockings steps out, somehow I know its the same figure just in a different form. "I wilt provide mine side of the deal and thee wilt wake up tomorrow in a mistress's corse, thee receiveth to keepeth 't for seven days. If 't be true thee fulfill the task did set thee can keepeth 't, if 't be true not thy soul becomes mine and thee join me, as thee can see from mine changes I possess many souls" he booms. "What?" I stutter. The figure steps back and reemerges as a fat middle aged man. "Its simple kid, tomawhrow yuh wake up as a girl. Right? I've put de settings at random and tuh give tuh a spawhtin' chance, I've made sure your become someone healthy and between 18 and 50, othuh than dat all bets are off. Okay? Yuh could wake up pretty, ugly, rich, poawh, black, white or whatevuh. Yuh could be anyone or anywhere. Right? Chubby college girl in Ottawa, tired housewife in Idaho, hawhse faced hotel maid in Lima, hardass cop in Lagos, rich kid socialite in Shanghai or drunken whore in Kiev. Right? When yuh look in dat mirrawh in de mawhnin' though, yuh know how easy or difficult it's gonna be tuh complete your tasks and save your soul. Ya' dig?" The New York accent is easier to understand than the old English one at least I manage "What tasks?"

The figure reappears as a middle aged woman with tied up faded blonde hair, its wearing a green skirt and blazer with an eagle embroidered on the breast "First I must explain vhen you vake up tomorrow, you vill nicht only haf a new body but a new life. You vill inherit a chob, friends, family a vhole new identity undt you kannot neglect zis by r-r-runningkt off to komplete your tasks" I shake and yell "what tasks?"

Next it appears as a woman in a ragged dress and clownish looking makeup applied, her hair is frizzled and when she smiles half her teeth are gone and half are brown "In the seven days that yor a girl yer must fuck five lads! Struth! Yeah that's right, thought yer was gonna cast yor wee spell and become some cute lesbian, uh 'uh that ain't the chuffin' way we work 'round 'ere. Might be easy, might be tough I think me mate Fat Guido mentioned its pot luck wot body yer cop. Word ter the chuffin' wise though, whoever yer choose yer end up wiv a fetish for that yer carry for life should yer succeed. Let me lay it straight lad, if one o' the bloody lucky five is a 42 year ole wite lad wiv a mustache then yer gain a lifelong fetish for all blokes like that. So choose wisely, unless yer wake up in a form in that beggars can't be choosers! Struth!"

By now I'm catatonic with fear as the figure emerges as a huge black man in a trench coat, like something from the 70s. "Yo! As for dase lucky fahve men. 'S coo', bro. Fahrst once ya is intimate wahth dem ya must does whatever day ask of ya, like, so agaahn choose wahsely ahf ya can. Sheeeiit. Second whatever ya does ta dase men a' whatever day does ta ya chages ya mahnd so aht becomes a lahfelong kink of yas". "But.." I stammer as it fades away.

It reappears as the same small girl. She or it smiles "Cedric, Guido, Helga, Alice and Curtis are just a few of the souls I've collected along the way, you really don't want to join them it's best for you if you fulfill the task but I will enjoy collecting you once you fail" with a flash of light she disappears.

So, have I got this straight? I wake up tomorrow in a random woman's body she could be anyone and anywhere, she has a life and history, I have seven days to find five dudes to sleep with, I must do everything they tell me to and I will develop both lifelong kinks for what I do and a fetish for the type of guy, if I succeed I keep the body, if I fail I get sucked into hell to become one of her servants alongside Guido, Alice et al...a little help?

How to prolong clutch life? 2012 GTI here, APR Stage 2, stock 6mt and diff, Stoptech sport pads.  Original owner, now at 116K miles, and looking at my 3rd clutch replacement.


Little bit of back story:

Stage 1 at 3k miles, stage 2 around 10k, stock clutch started slipping shortly after that.  Upgraded to a Southbend DXD Stage 2 Daily.  I'm not sure how long it lasted, probably around 2 years, before it started slipping too.  I admit I abused it - hard launches, flat shifting, didn't baby it when it was slipping.  Sent it in to SB for a rebuild, they replaced the disc with an Endurance disc (feramic on the flywheel side, organic on the PP side).  Pressure plate burst about a year and a half later, likely from being abused and heat stressed.   I replaced it with a new kit, again a Stage 2 Endurance.  I forget how many miles I was at, I think somewhere around 80k, maybe less.  Shortly thereafter, I got the Stage 2 ECU update as well as the software 2 step function.


This time around, I'm going to buy a new kit again (either a Daily or Endurance) and send the old one in for a rebuild so I have a spare clutch on hand.  But I'm wondering if I need to make more adjustments to my driving style.


My driving style: Very spirited, though I avoid hard launches.  Occasional flat shift at WOT.  I try to avoid getting the clutch too hot; I don't slip it any more than I need to.  My commute doesn't involve a lot of stop and go; I don't do the dumb stuff like holding the car on a hill with the clutch or resting my foot on the pedal.  I figure that heat is a clutch's worst enemy, and I try to keep that in mind.  Still, what can I probably do differently?  I'm probably never going to drive it like my grandmother, because kinda racecar...

N2MB WOT box install on 1997 bmw z3 (m52b28) So i purchased a wot box for my z3, and need some guidance on installing it. For the box i need: coil input and output, ground, throttle position input, clutch wire input, tach/rpm input signal. I was thinking of splicing the wires from pin 12 on the ecu for tps, and pin 83 for camshaft/ rpm signal. How should i go about connecting coil input and output and l clutch wire?

HOW WILL MY NIECE DRAW!? Ok, obligatory mobile formatting. So for those who read BUT THY’RE HUNGRY. This takes place at the same super market.

I just finished my shift literally 2 minutes ago. At about 6:30pm, I was called up to the register to help serve.(I work on floor so I just help out where ever I am told to)

EP= entitled parent
S= super nice superviser
ME= a shopping trolley

ME: hi how are you

EP: great and you

ME: pretty good, shift is nearly over.

I noticed that she had a box of textures and some on the side with tape over the caps.

EP hands me a receipt can and says..

EP: I bought a box of these yesterday for my niece but these ones caps won’t stay on, can I trade these for the ones in this box?

A brand new box and she want to TRADE the texters that caps so t stay on for new ones...

Wot

ME: sorry but to do that I think you would have to bring the whole box back.

EP: can’t you just trade the markers?
My niece has already started drawing with the other ones.

She was obviously getting annoyed that she couldn’t just trade the markers in.

ME: sorry I’ll just go grab my superviser.

I walk three steps to the cigarette counter and get my superviser.

She comes over and things get heated.

EP: this young child here is is not allowing me to switch these markers!

S: “do you have the full set and the box?”

EP: “NO, I JUST WANT TO SWITCH THESE MARKERS !”

S: “we cannot switch these otherwise we would have an incomplete set. You will need to bring in the other markers for us to switch them.”

EP’s son (who goes to my school mind you) is just standing behind her looking like he wants to die.

ME: “ma’am if you think that I am a child, do you think that your son would be old enough to work here?”

EP: “YES HE IS OBVIOUSLY MORE MATURE THAN YOU”

ME: “ma’am I am the school captain and 2 years above your son.”

I’m my school it is split into junior campus and senior campus, we have school captain-me year 10. And college captain - year 12.

This bitch looks at her son and he just nods.

S: “ma’am please leave this store”

EM: “ NOT UNTIL I GET MY MARKERS SWITCHED”

She grabs the new box of markers and sprints

I go to chase her but S stops me and just points to the security cameras.

Don’t know if she will be caught but I hope so.

TL;DR entitled bitch steals a box of markers after we won’t let her swap about 5 of them.

Not a very good ending but screw it may aswell post it here.

Fun Coincidence with Game Announcements I shared this in a big thread but I think it got buried): (I can't even find it lol)

FUN THING THAT KEEPS HAPPENING!

1) When Black and White was announced, I was coincidentally in NYC at the time for a family vacation my mom planned. Passed it off as a "hahaha hey look at that!" and carried on.
2) When X and Y was announced, my mom had planned out our next trip just prior - to France. I just considered it a happy weird coincidence again and carried on.
3) When Sun and Moon was announced, we got our plane tickets for our next family vacation...to Hawaii...(At this point I was like wot). My boyfriend and I did definitely have fun playing Sun &amp; Moon IN Hawaii too though lmao.
4) Yesterday my mom booked our summer trip for next year. It's to England, Wales, and Ireland.
Today's direct announced the new region, and that's the UK pretty much.

UM.
IS MY MOM PSYCHIC???
THIS IS FREAKIN' ME OUT HERE.
(But also seriously, WTF LMFAO, I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP)

Two days post surgery and stent started coming out! I am exactly 2 days post surgery to remove a stone from my Tube. When I went to use the bathroom two hours ago, I noticed a lot of leaking when I stood up. I quickly sat down on the toilet and discovered to my horror that the stent was halfway out! 😱
I immediately called my urologist office and spoke to a nurse. She told me to go ahead and pull the rest out. I am wot tied about healing because it has only been 2 days. Anyone else have this happen?

Recently got a ST, looking for driving tips! Hey y'all! I just got a '18 ST over the weekend, and so far it's been a blast to drive. It's my first manual, so I've been learning a lot of the basics recently. I'm really interested in learning to drive this thing the proper™ way so that I can ensure my engine and transmission last a long time, while still having fun when I'm exploring those windy back roads.

I see a lot of discussion on here about the best RPMs to be shifting for different driving experiences, when it's ok for some WOT, and all that, which can get a little confusing to someone like me with little experience. So what tips would you give to someone that doesn't know... pretty much anything regarding a small turbo charged engine?


I'd appreciate a clear explanation of what exactly WOT is and when it is ok to push the car like that. I've heard to avoid doing it at "low speeds" but that's pretty vague. Is that generally below 2k RPM? And how do I avoid turbo buildup if it could be an issue in higher gears? I see the gauge moves when I put the pedal down, but even when I give a moderate amount of gas the turbo gauge fills to at least a quarter.

Generally when I drive, I keep the RPMs between 2-3k. I've been having a bit of trouble smoothly moving from 1st to 2nd but everything else is pretty natural. Shifting into some of the gears also feels kinda... bumpy? I'm not sure if this was caused by the previous owner (purchased w/ ~14k miles) but when I shift into 5th sometimes it feels like there's a little bit of resistance halfway through the movement. Nothing that stops me from shifting, but I can feel it. Is this normal? My last car was a POS with over 100k miles on it at time of purchase, so I'm not familiar with the level of maintenance typically done on a relatively brand new Focus.

Anyways, please enlighten me!

I got bullied by an entitled 6 yr old Yes you read the title I got bullied by a six yr old.this is my first story so sorry for poor punctuation.

alright so for some background I'm an 11 yr old 4 foot 11 kid with rlly bad anxiety and rlly sensitive and on the other hand the entitled 6yr old who thinks they can get what they want by rolling on the floor with wails that sound like she's just crawled out of a  vat of acid.

Alright so I was just heading to our friends house to say hi and see my other friends and play in the trampoline.

So I go in the garden and say hi and then ek blocks of our other friends saying hi by saying "ugh what are you doing here only 3 allowed"when there's like a 10 limit.I say "I just came to say hi not to be a spazzy squirrel"Tbh I was honestly done with her crap on got on then outta no where she punches me directly in the ribs and im proper skinny to the point where I look like a dinner bone.

This hurt a lot so I ran back to my house and made up a lie so my dad wouldn't go there and shout at her so I went upstairs and stayed in bed for a good 20 mins before telling my mum wot happened.


Sorry that this is so long and there's no happy ending but I hope you guys all enjoyed.

EP:Hippity hoppity your table is now my property "I omae WA mu shinderu'ed on her" Backstory
 I'm 16 rn
 also I am a professional sociopath.(I did go to a professional and they said I had I'm not saying this because I'm edgy)
Story
I was in a shopping mall with my parents buying groceries and stuff but this time we decided to eat lunch in the food level of the mall instead of going home and cooking it.
I order my food and sit in my seat while I wait for my parents to find something they like and order (it takes a long time for them to order)
NEW CHALLENGER  APPROACHES
Yall know the drill EP=entitled parent CK=confused kid me=me

EP just sits in our table without even asking if I'm leaving or not and force sits the CK on another sit
Here is where my sociopath behaviours kick in so
In my country if an adult touches a minor any thing that is done by the minor is considered self defense if the adult touches the kid first(I dont mean that touch ,the SFW touch you sicc friccs)
I decided to exploit that and bare in mind I'm 185 cm (almost 6'1") and this EP is prob 4'10" so basically im an Amazon to her so I can easily take her down (I have a brown belt in karate so I know a couple of stuff)
Also this was not in English so its roughly translated
Me:
ma'am I'm waiting on my order I am still sitting here.
EP:
find another table I'm too tired boy you can find one yourself
(The place did not have a single free table in a 100 kilometer radius)
Me:
I'm not going to get off my table to look for a table you dumb idiot (I wanted to tick her off so badly now so she touches me so I could let some anger out ya'know
Ck:
mom let's look for another table plz i feel embarrassed
EP:
no son your class was so tiring you need to sit here so you dont hurt your bones
Me:(visible confusion) wdym ? Get off my table now or I'll tell my parents to come !
EP:
(in shock of such RUDE WORDS) you either get off this table or I'll tell your parents how RUDE you are to DISABLED KIDS
CK:
(even more visible confusion) wot?mom am I disabled ?
EP:
yes
This is the reason I nicknamed him (confused kid) he was also prob 8/9 so he had no idea how he was disabled(tho he wasnt)
Me:
I will sit on this chair untill you do something, I'll allow you to drag me out of my chair if you can;)
EP tried to actually DRAG me off my chair which was my plan all along I let her touch my shoulder and then I get her hand off me (knowing full well the security camera is looking at me) I grab her hand take her down on both knees and put her hand on her back shouting SECURITY.
Now I have created a scene with everyone looking basically and now the security guard comes and I explain what "happened" and told them that she wanted to take me with her and.... she tried to prove me wrong but I said there is footage of it and they check the camera and it looks like so that she wanted to take me, the guard asks if I wanted to press charges for sexual assault and the CK was BEGGING I say no.
As much of a feeling less piece of shit I am ,the kid reminded me of myself when I was 8 so I thought there is hope in this child turning out normal so I decided not to press charges.
I went over to the EP and whispered in her ear
" I always think 2 steps ahead fat c%$@"
And that's how I sociopath'ed a sociopath
Sidenote: my parents were aware and let me choose to press charges or not

I [24M] have been texting with a girl[19], suddenly stops responding So here’s the deal. I know a girl and i really like her. Thing is, we live very far from each other, in different countries and we only get the chance to meet like twice a year when we go visit a certain place.

So it started with me accidently calling her instead of a friend back in september. Since then we’ve been texting pretty much every day. Random small talk, flirty, playful, fun and things like that. We met back in january but things didnt go as planned because she came later than planned (which gave us less time to hang out), she also had to help out A LOT all fu\*\*\*\*\* day at the house (the reason is legit and 100% true though, so cant really blame her), and then she became sick (i thought she was bullshitting, but it really was true), so i couldnt really do much at all… We had agreed (while texting before we met) on going out for a beer, to play pool table, go to a shopping mall etc, every time i suggested something she accepted it, but in the end we didnt do any of it because of the reasons i listed…

So she went back home and we kept texting for a few days and now suddenly she starts leaving me on read/seen. It has been like this since the beginning of february - a little texting then she leaves me on read. So i was just wondering if you guys can help me measure her interest somehow. I’ll try to avoid a WoT but give as many details as possible. So here it goes…

\- She has spent like 5 months texting me pretty much daily (lots of time investment).

\- LOTS of all kinds of physicality. Everything from playfully hitting me on the shoulder when i tease her, to compare our hands, to telling me to fix her hair, placing her legs over mine, slightly resting her leg against my leg, kisses on the cheek, holding hands with fingers interlocked (this was more in a playful way though, but she is ok with it). I was drunk one night and went over to her, she lead me up to her bedroom so i would calm down a little. I was laying down and then i went like come here as i sat up, grabbed her and pulled her over me as i laid down again. So she was laying over me. I started to play with her hair and massaged her neck, she reciprocated. Was not really able to do much else because i was drunk af and we werent alone in the house…

I dont know how much or what this means, but she is clearly very comfortable with being physical with me.

\- She has invited me over to her place (where she actually lives). She wants me to come so i can attend this special event that will take place in 2 months. Now it turns out i will be going to where she lives with a friend in like 3 weeks. I told her this and she goes like OOOH DONT MESS AROUND WITH ME OMG IM SO FU\*\*\*\*\* HAPPY!

I jokingly asked her ”haha wanna see me that bad?” and she goes like ofcccc. I tell her she will have to show me around the city and then boom she leaves me on read wtf. I ofc refuse to text her even a letter when she leaves me on read, and today i put up a story on snapchat, and then she opens me with something like ”HAHAHAHAHA I LOVE YOUUU, OMG I DONT KNOW WHY BUT I FOUND THIS SO FUNNY”

A few texts back and forth later - boom got left on read again. I have been left on read quite a few times, but she always re-opens sooner or later, so i atleast dont have to double text because she re-opens herself.

\- She has said she loves me (i think 2 or 3 times face 2 face) and like 5+ times over text. How the f do i interpret this? I mean, its not like we have been dating and that we are bf/gf. Luckily she hasnt ever called me friend or said that she loves me as a friend. Just i love you. Though once she said that she viewed me as a very dear person to her and that she loves me and that i love to annoy the shit out of her and that she will beat me up one day haha.

So what do you guys think? Is there any interest? Is it fading out?

I’ll be visiting her city with a friend as i said, and my plan is to either get her out on a 1on1 date or try to arrange for us to meet up somehow on a friday or saturday night in a club or whatever and simply go for it. Is it worth it? Im at the point now where i dont really care what happens. I like her because she is hot af and she is a very cool and fun person, so i atleast want to bang her. If she likes me and something happens - awesome, if not im fine with it as well and now i know that i dont need to spend time and energy on her any longer and i barely ever see her anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Been texting a girl for around 5 months daily. Cant meet her because of very long distance, so its the only way to keep in touch. Now, suddenly, she is leaving me on read very often. She seems to be interested because she never rejected date ideas and there has been lots of physicality, also invited me over to her place. Also said she loves me several times (not as in i love you as a friend, but just love you), how do i interpret that? Also said she was very f\*\*\*\*\*\* happy when i told her i was coming to her city and just 1 text later she leaves me on read wtf.

Is she interested?

Still involuntary celibate, but had a fight with gf. Wot do? So, I guess borderline personality disorder is associated with sexual abuse. I didnt know. I was on discord and was talking to some friends and she overheard. When I went to pee she stopped me after and wanted to talk about how awful I was. We basically got on the subject about how an 11 year old still shouldnt abort. We are both atheists. She said that obviously the kid didnt spread her legs and shouldnt go through a trauma of carrying a baby full term, and that she can die bc shes so young yadda yadda typical stuff. She brings up how she was raped at 12 yadda yadda and I tell her, and not the first time, that i was raped at 4 so i DO have a right to talk about it and then shes like okay but youd never have to be preg as a kid. So 2hy the fuck is my opinion invalidated? bitch shouldnt have got pregnart! Dont hang around bad men, shes 11 not 4! If it's the grandpa then stay away, ffs. I was a fucking toddler, I had no choice.




Qnyways, how do o fix this? Shes mad but not super mad. O btw I let jer.move in and she didnt leave, she said wed tok in the morning.

My guide to grime To understand grime, I think you have to understand where grime comes from. Rather as seeing it as the UK version of hip hop, you have to understand how it stands on its own, as more of a cousin instead.


**UK Garage**

Before grime, there was UK Garage. This was genre started as an offshoot of American house music, and infused that sound with r&amp;b melodies. Some groups popular at the time include [Pay As U Go Cartel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YyGe7OFvnI) (featuring future grime MCs Wiley, Flowdan, &amp; Breeze), [So Solid Crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMPZ5ZqLgNc), [Roll Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xqqbjDbf6E) (featuring some members of Pay As U Go and introduced Dizzee Rascal) and [Heartless Crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEYQM1mm8Rc). Important to note here that this sound is similar to what was going on in the US as well, with [Timbaland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD1xOubTZYU&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL_FcU55FSWhzgDS5EqSxbY5o1zOVGJLig) being one producer whose material at the time would go on to influence grime music (also notable is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw7ukmZVQHg) "accidental" grime track produced by none other than Kanye West). As you can tell, one of the characteristics of UKG was that instead of relying heavily on sampling like American hip hop, drum machines and synths were used giving it that very electronic feel.  As the UKG scene was moving to a darker gritter sound, you can see a bit of the transition period in this track, [Pulse X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjoNPDK9RwI), considered to be the first grime track.


**Early Grime**


When you look back at the origins of grime, there are two names that stand out above all, Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. Wiley was the mastermind behind the grime movement, and he took younger Dizzee under his wing and showed him the ropes, as it were. And thus, grime's breakout hit was born, [I Luv U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH0KWX2a8zY). Produced and written by Dizzee himself at the age of 16, I Luv U solidified grime as a genre. He was influenced by US hip hop on this track, borrowing the call and response choruses of songs like [What's Your Fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq-Ru6kQhE4) and [Is That Your Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1KnK9-rPsc). A year later, Dizzee released his debut album, Boy in da Corner on XL Records. Produced almost entirely by Dizzee alone, the album painted a darker picture of his life at the time, with cold and hollow instrumentals and lyrics like these:


&gt;Looks like I'm losing friends there's a lot of hostility in my ends
&gt;
&gt;We used to argue always make up and be friends
&gt;
&gt;Now we settle disagreements with the skengs
&gt;
&gt;Looks like I'm losing mates, there's a lot hostility near my gates
&gt;
&gt;We used to fight with kids from other estates
&gt;
&gt;Now eight millimetres settle debates
&gt;
&gt;Looks like I'm losing sight 'cause I'm looking at the future, it ain't bright
&gt;
&gt;So I look out my window and pray every night
&gt;
&gt;I thank God for my friends, but they ain't tight
&gt;
&gt;Looks like I'm losing hope 'cause I climb this mountain without rope
&gt;
&gt;But I know I'm the captain of my boat, so I steadily sail and hope not to float

\- Dizzee Rascal - Brand New Day

A year later, Wiley who was also signed to XL, released his debut Treddin on Thin Ice. One of the main singles [Wot Do U Call It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8PeDsO0vGo) addresses the response the genre was getting at the time. This ended up being his only release on XL Recordings, and the end of his partnership with them could be seen as a response to the [beef with Dizzee](https://www.reddit.com/r/grime/comments/9pzs5z/quick_summary_of_the_aiya_napa_incident_and_why/) that ended their friendship, and still lingers to this day. The fallout from this beef is still seen today, as Wiley suffered some scars from being stabbed and is pretty self conscious about it. He has refused to appear in some of his own music videos due to this.


After Boy in da Corner, I felt Dizzee had start to distance himself from grime music. His influences from US hip hop were growing more and more apparent, leading to songs like [Sirens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPpxxrl0xhM) and [Dance Wiv Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2MiyZx8MTY) (which was the first I'd ever heard of Calvin Harris, back when he not only produced, but sang on his tracks as well).


Some other notable artists at the time are [More Fire Crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTek4AdPkik), [Tinchy Stryder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwZv8IgDtQY) (some very evident UKG vibes on this song, Tinchy was a former member of Roll Deep), [Newham Generals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9mU8iusLak), [Skepta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_u7OI5Euo), [JME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj1N9d8P4bg), [Kano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mznv4ACjkzc) and many more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Moving on from grime**

As shown above with Dizzee Rascal's evolution, many grime artists were starting to make other dance music instead. Possibly grime just wasn't profitable enough, or maybe they were burnt out on the sound, MCs like [Skepta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnar90VEwe4), [Wiley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxjdg_D5YQY), [Dizzee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISy0Hl0SBfg), [Tinchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJsVDH-3b3Y), [Kano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM6YBeegBVY) were all producing more poppier music. One thing to note here, this was the time when a very popular style of music blew up from the UK making its way to the US. Producers who used to be making garage had started making darker garage in tandem with the grime scene at the time, and this evolved into a sound known as dubstep. Some of the originators of this sound include [Skream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6WJYe6n-l8), [Benga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNStVlJWy88), [Rusko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwfWSX0FYlI), [Caspa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjodqCQZ-dY) and [Plastician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu8BVT5Yt2U). Not to be confused with the Americanized genre at the time (dubbed Brostep), you can see some of the similarities between the grime and dubstep scenes like the use of synths and drum machines, the tempo (140 beats per minute) and the general simplicity of the composition. Also during this scene there were some MCs for sure who were continuing the grime sound, and even some like [P Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA5b0LDfZi0) who were spitting over dubstep instrumentals.


**Return to grime**

Like I said, for sure there were artists who were continuing to make grime even when some of the most popular MCs had moved on, but I felt a definite shift when Skepta returned to grime with his tracks [Shutdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQOG5BkY2Bc) and [That's Not Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xQKWnvtg6c). The rest is kind of history. Some MCs have moved back away from the genre again like Skepta and Wiley, while ones like Dizzee have sort of come back around to it. And so let me talk about more of the culture surrounding the genre:


**Radio Sets**

One thing to keep in mind about grime, is that it's less about writing hit songs and more about having hit bars. When grime was starting out, it wasn't in the forefront of music at the time and so to share it with the country, pirate radio stations were used. These stations broadcast music on unused radio frequencies at the time, and were curated just like regular radio by Grime DJs. Grime MCs were invited to perform on pirate radio, and they were there to freestyle. Unlike the common idea of freestyling, these MCs weren't coming up with material off the top of the head, it was all pre-written, but the freestyle was being able to flow over any beat the DJ threw at you. Sometimes you'll catch a beat switch at the right time and the DJ will wheel you up to show you did well ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSbZslT1tHc) are a few examples so you hopefully get the right idea). Radio culture is still big to this day, Sir Spyro being one of the big names in radio sets for a while now.


**International Grime**
Grime has reached all over. With a distinct sound and culture, it's not hard to imagine others around the world identifying with it and wanting to make it their own. You've got artists in [Korea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giea5R9RotA), [Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49qhDTWPcYQ), [Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPM-ZyNuScY), [Finland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMdGtRMLe5U), [Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JGRTnkFF_c) and of course [US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQk_K3Gzxps) and [Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfXuotidNhY) (Tre Mission being from I think either Ajax or Whiby).


**8 Bar Riddims**

This is a popular format for grime tracks and includes multiple MCs performing for 8-16 musical bars before switching out to the next. This goes back even to UKG group So Solid Crew on their track [21 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7VhofoV3qs), named after the amount of time each artist got to spit on the track. Some other notable 8 bar riddims include [Pow (Forward)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60lMDCXFblc), [Pow 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzU5Q4uI3iw), [Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk4qfri3X8U), [Spartan Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEMDZe1wZXA), [Southside Riddim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aKHUoIHZV4) and more recently [10/10 Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw9tx7tLkww) and [Gridlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITowWHwtfLo).


**Clashes**

Not to be outdone with US hip hop and their beef/rap battles, grime has a history of its own too. From Jammer's [Lord of the Mic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTF_T47CDnI) series to standalone clashes there's plenty there. Notably [Dizzee vs Crazy Titch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il8dXEfXerc), [Skepta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKutTL_KLig) vs [Devilman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-dTi4lqMMw), [Chip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naHyVia6Zfk) vs [Bugzy Malone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYqKNglQhpI), [Big H vs P Money](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4a2fnw) (watch as Big H gets thoroughly embarrassed), [P Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O16n2yPjEw) vs Dot Rotten (you can find reuploads of Dot Rotten's stuff but he deleted it all after the beef, which goes to show how well that went for him), and most recently, [Skepta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tcq_eEDf_w) vs [Wiley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bu5BHimwsU).

&amp;#x200B;

**Grime crossover**

Still a growing topic, there are a few bands who've crossed over with grime influences. This includes hardcore bands [TRC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax5GIzAHNsw), [Gassed Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1GHwV4sU3A) and metal band [Hacktivist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7NYeP-t15o). [Astroid Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAJV7l5AWI4) also crosses over from time to time with influences from both hardcore and metal.

Not For Us [Original prompt: The armies of good have been crushed, The Chosen one is dead, along with his ragtag bunch of misfits, and the Dark Lords reign of terror has begun. And do you know what? Things ain't so bad.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/aaymsm/wp_the_armies_of_good_have_been_crushed_the/)

“Look, I’m not saying this is ideal,” Ferly said—always practical in his unscrupulousness. “But what’s a bit of bowing, really? We had t’ salute the old guards, didn’ we?”

Pip rolled her eyes. “Yeah, and they didn’ take our ‘eads off if we didn’, did they?”

“Bet they would’ve ‘f they could.”

Knowing more than a few of them back then herself, she had to give him that. Mean lot, the lot of ‘em, wanting nothing more than to hear their own voices and use the pretty notepad bought on the people’s taxes. Not that she or Ferly had ever paid a tax they could dodge, but, if they were proper members of society, they would have rather the money was spent on something more useful to maintaining public order, like another drinking house. Nothing in the world maintained public order better than locking the disorderly behind a door, after all.

“I say, I say, so ye canno’ say anythin’ bad ‘bout the guy—wot’s that t’ me? No skin off my back, eh. I ain’t met ‘im. Better thin’s t’ worry for, ain’t there?”

“Then you say one night down the pub: maybe the taxes are a bit high. Next thin’ you know, i’s your head on the block and everyone’s cheering.”

Ferly shrugged. “Canno’ blame them—who doesn’ like a good chop?”

“And y’ve missed the point entirely,” Pip said, the words coming out like a long sigh.

He waved her off. “Nah, I ge’ it, I do. The thing is, he needs muck like us, righ’? Canno’ run a-narmy on black cloaks and glowers now, can ye? So, keep t’ the farms and the fac’ries and don’ talk abou’ taxes or tariffs or anythin’ but the waitress’ arse and we’ll be fine, won’ we?”

“Business as usual for you, then,” Pip said, trying not to give him the smile he craved, but failing.

“Tha’s wot I bin saying all along. So everythin’s a bi’ drab and gloomy, a’least i’s not some garish yellow or sumin’. Could be a lo’ worse.”

Pip looked from her mug of ale to the window, night outside peppered with lamps and stars, no moon to be seen. “Yeah, and thin’s could be a lot better too.”

“No’ for us.”

She wished she could say something back to that, but she couldn’t.

“Yeah, not for us.”

GM significantly alters Tomb of Horrors, kills me with an instant death trap Some spoilers for the beginning part of Tomb of Horrors below, I didn't get too far in before I died.

I was going into the adventure almost completely blind. I knew about ToH's reputation and had heard the occasional vague spoiler, but that's it. At no point did the DM give any indication that this adventure would be pretty heavily altered compared to what is in the book, at some points he omits important details, and ultimate ends up killing me with an instant-death no-save trap. I didn't feel too salty about it when I died, but I was pretty convinced that Tomb of Horrors wasn't for me and I would have no desire to play it again, so after I died I went and read the version printed in Tales from the Yawning Portal, and only then did several differences stand out to me, and I can't shake the feeling that things were altered in the Dungeon specifically to target me and get me out of the game quickly. Let's go through them one by one.

* In this one-shot adventure, we were all level 14, I rolled a multiclass Druid Barbarian. Being a 9th level Druid gave me some pretty useful spells, including Conjure Animals which I figured would be a pretty useful way to play minesweeper with the traps in the Tomb. I rolled well on my stats so I had quite a bit of HP (not to mention going Circle of the Moon). I also took the Observant feat, Perception proficiency, AND picked a Sentinel Shield as a magic item, bringing my passive Perception score up to 29. Pretty good, right?

* So, that first corridor within the non-trapped entrance. The one that's filled with the red path and several pit traps? Pretty straight forward traps, this is probably the perfect place for my Conjure Animals spell to map out all the traps ahead. Nope. An Antimagic Field is covering the entire corridor, dispelling all my animals as soon as they enter and rendering all spellcasters useless in this entire room. I've looked in several version of ToH and couldn't find any version with an Antimagic Field covering the first room.

* Alright fine, surely my 29 passive Perception would handle this right? Welp, the DM didn't let me use passive Perception... at all. He said that passive Perception can only be used to notice things that are plainly odd-looking, not to search for hidden things, even though the PHB specifically lists searching for secret doors as an example use for passive Perception. I wasn't even allowed to use passive even after our rogue rolled Investigation and pointed out a trap. Like, I get that high passive Perception might be considered cheese by some DMs, but I had specifically discussed my build with the DM before the game began and they had absolutely no problem with it.

* There's a riddle written along the red path in the first corridor. The DM messaged our rogue in private and told them about the riddle, which they then informed us of. My character, with 29 perception apparently didn't notice anything peculiar about the red path at all, hmmm...

* So, one line in the riddle reads: **"Shun green if you can, but night's good color is for those of great valor."**
Okay, avoid the color green, seems reasonably straight forward. Those of you who have played Tomb of Horrors probably remember this: there's a particularly lethal object lying at one end of this first corridor. An object that just so happens to be green. Obviously we should avoid that object, right? Right. **Except the DM neglected to mention the fact that the object is green.** Thankfully we were all paranoid enough that nobody died to this object. I messaged the DM afterwards about the glaring omission, and they claimed that the warning about green was referring to the green sphere in the upcoming room filled with colored spheres instead. I looked it up, there is absolutely nothing dangerous about the green sphere in that room, and most of the internet seems to agree that the warning is referring to the green object in the first corridor.

* Next up, the magic mist-filled archway. Our paladin went through without touching the coloured stones and vanished. At this point the game had slowed to a snail's pace because I guess everyone was too scared of dying. "Welp, nothing ventured" I thought, and followed our paladin through the archway. We get teleported into a tiny stone room with no means of escape and with three levers on the wall. Now, according to the book, moving all three levers up should open up an escape, moving them all down drops you down a pit trap. I didn't know this at the time, but by chance I moved all the levers up. No dice, pit trap opens up and we fall down. The DM explains afterwards that moving all the levers **left or right** would have lead to escape, moving them **up or down** means pit trap. That's alright, maybe the DM just altered the trap a little to prevent cheating, it's still essentially a 50% chance of failure if you were guessing randomly. No big deal, right?

* According to the book, the pit trap is a 100-feet fall down, and the floor closes up after 10 minutes. Oh well, no big deal! Both me and the Paladin have more than enough HP to survive 10d6 of damage, and afterwards I could easily Wildshape and spider climb up out of the pit or something, I've got options, right? Nope.
**The DM declares the pit is filled with spikes and leads to an instant death.** You fucking wot?
I protest and say that I have options to save myself and possibly the Paladin as well. As part of creating our characters, our DM allowed us to choose 3 uncommon items and one rare item. I chose an Immovable Rod and a Cube of Force. I suggested that I should be able to A) Activate the Immovable Rod and hang in mid air and go from there, B) Activate the Cube of Force (which I had used previously to escape one of the trapped entrances at the beginning of ToH) so that we don't fall directly on the spikes, C) Wild Shape into a spider and stick to the wall, or D) I dunno Barbarian rage or something so I don't immediately die to spike traps. Nope! DM says that all of those are either actions or bonus actions, not reactions, so not allowed. No dexterity save to avoid falling into the pit, no damage roll, no magic items, no class features, nothing, we die.

* At this point, after explaining the trap to us, the DM offers us the option to continue playing as one of the hirelings that we had brought along, or to wait until the rest of the party had died and reset the dungeon. I said no thanks and left the game. I wasn't too salty, I knew that ToH had a reputation for killing character unceremoniously and I was kind of expecting to come out of this game with a negative opinion towards ToH. I was ready to declare this a badly designed adventure and move on, but I went and read the adventure just to be sure, and to see what the hype was about. And to my complete surprise... **Tomb of Horrors is actually far more lenient and was reasonably fair compared to what I was expecting.** At least, the TftYP version was, I know that earlier editions were a lot more deadly, but even the earlier editions didn't throw shit like antimagic fields and random chance no save instant death traps at you.

The more I thought about it afterwards the less that things made sense, and the more it felt like the DM was deliberately targeting me. I dunno, maybe they saw how my character could cheese the dungeon and panicked? It's kind of funny, I was expecting to hate Tomb of Horrors but this experience left me with a relatively positive disposition towards the adventure instead, I just wish the DM had told us that they were changing the dungeon so I didn't spoil myself needlessly.

I dunno, is all of this normal? Am I overreacting? Should I try Tomb of Horrors again if I get the chance (with a different DM)?

nutting in the school bathroom  I was secretly staring at my crush in class as I usually do, but then I started to get hornier and hornier until I reached my apex, my maximum threshold. I had no choice, but to carefully slide my phone down my pocket and ask the teacher to go to the bathroom. She's that teacher who never lets you go to the bathroom, but for some reason, she said yes this one time. I carefully walked to the door. When I got out of the classroom I went into full Usain bolt mode and rushed to the bathroom. When I got into the bathroom I pulled out my phone faster than any man has ever pulled out a phone before. I opened the PornHub app (yes I have the app). I went into my favorites list and found the perfect video. It was a video of a prison officer SLAM DUNKIN' two prostitutes. I'll give link if u want. I went full maximum overdrive on that dick, I beat my dick like no man has beaten anything before, I beat my dick like my dad beats me (w-wait wot). Within about 3 minutes I nutted on the wall with the sound of gunfire. Just imagine the juggernaut drive from highschool dxd just bustin' a nut. It pretty much looked like a lama had spit on the wall. I went back to class like nuttin' ever happened (heh u get it. nuttin instead of nothing. Anyone, ok, sry).. And the best part is. No one ever knew it was me. 1 year later there is still a mystery about the guy who nutted on the wall inside the school bathroom. It was a rumor that the maid refused to clean it up which I can't really be surprised at, like jeez she ain't gonna be paid minimum wage to clean up the sperm of a student. Like, hell naw. There is still nut stains on the wall to this very day.﻿

Abstraction Season 4 - Episode 6 [Finale] ##Hello and welcome to Abstraction Season 4!
_______

Abstraction is an RR organized by Mrsonicfan, MaverickMC, and Bacan where each season we try pairing cool gamemode combinations together while maintaining a rather different roster.

For our second season, we will be doing **Wished Teams of 2** with the gamemode **Scenario Stackup**. The scenario stackup makes it where a new scenario is enabled at the beginning of every episode. Here is the list of gamemodes:

* Episode 1 - **Dependency** - You must right click your teammate to craft and cannot use crafting tables unless you are the last one alive on your team.

* Episode 2 - **Double Dates** - Every team of two was rigged by the organizers to be teamed with another team of two.

* Episode 3 - **Parafusion** - Every time a player does a specific event, their coordinates are sent in the chat, but nobody knows which player it was.

* Episode 4 - **Border Shrink** - The border shrinks.

* Episode 5 - **Rewarding Longshots** -  Whenever a player gets a longshot of a certain distance, they receive rewards based on the distance.

* Meetup - **Gap Zap** - If you are hit while healing, the regeneration effect cancels.

Cobb Stage 1 93 Octane tune. I recently purchased a Cobb AccessPort tuner and installed it on my 2014 Focus ST. I first noticed that I was getting some knock on mild pulled in 4th gear and at WOT so naturally I hit some forums and decided to put some NGK-6510 spark plugs in gapped at .026. I also ran 2 gallons of E86 on top of my 93. It did help a bit with the knock, now it only knocks if you go positive on boost and you’re under 3k RPM. Or if you’re in 5th or 6th WOT. (I also read not to do pulls under 3k RPM because of these motors detonate at low RPMs and not to do WOT pulls in 5th and 6th) But for the sake of testing it I ran through 4th and kept going into 5th. I also watched the timing of all 4 cylinders and I couldn’t help but notice that if I do a pull the timing will range anywhere from -18 degrees to +50 degrees; now watching the ignition correction it never goes negative only positive 4 degrees and maxes out there. None of these numbers are constant; they all happen under load or close to WOT. I’m just trying to figure out what’s normal and what’s not. I’m debating getting a Stratified tune because it’s more of a costume tune.

Should I ask him to Prom??? Hey Guys!

So I have a small dilemma. There is this guy i like and he likes me back (his friends told me), but he is hesitant on asking me out. Idk y tho?? Prom is coming up soon and I was hoping he would ask me, but idk if he will. I need some advice. Should I ask him now that I feel like we both know we like each other. I assume this bc if his closest friends told me that he liked me I am sure they will tell him that I told them I like him. I just don't understand why he wot ask me. My school has a 3 day weekend rn bc of the snow and I have been lowkey contemplating this. Also, I wanted to start a relationship with him but my friends are hesitant about it bc they tell me its not good to start one at the end of your senior year (hence I am a senior and he is younger). I will miss him sm and I really like him so I dont care about the long distance. Any advice?

2005 Dodge Neon SRT-4 Intermittent Crank No-Start accompanied by P0499 Hello!

I have a 2005 Dodge Neon SRT-4 with around 167K miles.

I am not the original owner, so I am unaware if the fuel pump and regulator are original to the car or not.

Im located in an area where the temperature has been between 4 degrees and 40 degrees Fahrenheit recently, in case that is relevant.

One day last week, I went out to start my car and it cranked as normal, but did not turn over.

It took about 30 seconds of cranking for the car to start, and when it did finally start, the check engine light illuminated for code P0499.

As I thought it may have been a fluke, I cleared the code and proceeded to drive around 10 miles before the car died when putting it into first gear at a stop light. It took about 30 seconds and several key on/offs to start the car again.

I did not clear the code this time, and the car continued to drive mostly normally - occasionally it would feel like the car wanted to die for a second, but the car did not die again.

After several days, the CEL went away.

Code P0499 pointed at the Natural Vacuum Leak Detection Pump (NVLD), which I replaced with a brand new part from the dealer last Thursday just in case.

After replacing the NVLD the car continued to act  normal, until yesterday at lunch time.

The car drove to work without issue, but when lunch time rolled around I started the car and drove about one mile to Safeway. After spending 10-15 minutes inside Safeway, I came back outside and the car started, then died after two seconds. After dying, it again would crank normally but not start.

I pulled the ASD fuse in the car for one minute, which I believe resets the computer on this car. After doing so, the car started and idled for about 10 seconds, then died again when I revved it in neutral.

After this, the car would not start again.

I swapped the ASD/Fuel Pump Relay with the Horn Relay, which made no difference.

I replaced the ASD fuse with a brand new fuse, which made no difference.

I then swapped the fuel pump relay back in it's original place, and the car started normally but illuminated P0499 again.

Since then I have not changed anything, and P0499 went out again on my way home.

I do not believe the issue is with the NVLD pump itself, as the car only throws that CEL when it dies or will not start.

I have no other codes stored, I am using a DiabloSport Trinity to read codes (the car is on a stock tune, it is not flashed).

Do you think this is a sign that the fuel pump, or fuel regulator (which I believe acts as a fuel filter on this car) are going bad, or am I looking in the wrong direction?

I would eventually like to upgrade to a 255lph fuel pump for future mods for the car anyway, so if there's a decent chance it's the pump I'll shell the money out and buy one.

I am trying to pay careful attention to whether the fuel pump is priming or not before I start the car now, but I won't be able to tell for sure until it acts up again.

I did seem to hear the fuel pump prime a bit inconsistently (it wasn't a steady noise like usual, it waivered a bit in volume), but I have only heard it do that once.

When I put my ear onto the seat of the back seat, I can hear an audible whining - though I've never done this before, so I am unsure if the noise is new or is normal for the car.

The AFR at idle is reading 15.1 rather than the normal 14.7, but drops to 10 under WOT as I would expect it to.

The SKIM does not seem to be at fault for this, as I am using the same key I have always used, and the security light on the dash does go out as normal.

Pretty stumped as I have limited mechanical experience, and I'd love to have some second opinions and ideas before throwing a fuel pump at it.

Thanks everyone, and apologies for the wall of text!

My LA teacher is an anti vaxxer So let me start with some backstory on the teacher. She’s probably around 70 and awful. She yells at kids for no reason, assigns a ton of homework, you know the deal.

We were writing essays for LA and someone’s topic was vaccinations. The teacher overheard and said “There’s a bunch of evidence on both sides of that debate you know.”

Of course my friends and I were like wot m8 how

“My grandson has autism and we think it might have been caused by the MMR vaccine.”

I almost downright laughed as she had just been talking about the importance of doing good research. I immediately googled it and the whole first page of sources said that vaccines didn’t cause autism. (Duh) Sadly, class ended before I could prove her wrong. I feel sorry for her family.

Gender Inequality Phrases? When my friend (girl) says to me (guy), "A big boy's gotta eat." I think she's saying a grown-up boy like me has to eat. I take it as a compliment.

But when I say, "A big girl's gotta eat" to my other friend (girl), she's like "ARE YOU CALLING ME FAT?!"

wot.

Same thing happened when I said that to my girlfriend and she flipped me off.

Why is that the first thing that pops into their minds?

Rebuilding a Salvage 370Z with rocks and bolts from other cars poured into oil fill cap. I was asked to also post this to this subreddit after posting a similar post to r/nissan

Some information first--------------

I am an amateur, I have no experience other than watching hundreds of hours of youtube tear-downs and some engineering classes in HS.

I bought this car for 12K shipped to my door, it is a 2014 Nissan 370Z 6/M with the performance package. It has 15,007 miles.

 The repairs --------------------

4 new tires

hood, bumper, and FR Fender need repainting

1 cracked rim

**REMOVE** **ROCKS AND BOLTS FROM ENGINE** and replace ladder assembly

Driver Side airbag replaced

Seatbelts de-torqued

Install spoiler

\---------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2xtvn0gjvpk21.jpg

This is how it came off the truck from NJ.

https://i.redd.it/650eblyavpk21.jpg

So this is around when I knew I wouldn't be driving any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b9atjehqvpk21.jpg

After further Inspection, I removed this from under the oil fill cap using a magnetic wand.

https://i.redd.it/liqlxgfcwpk21.jpg

So I used this to remove larger rocks and screws from the DOHC area.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/402qxm0lwpk21.jpg

This is everything that I removed up to that point, I had more ,but I cant post an updated picture as I am not home. Lots of rocks, and non metric bolts (not from a Nissan)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/av8dqucwwpk21.jpg

This was as torn down as I took the engine, I used a borescope to examine the oil channels and deeper parts of the engine. I was tempted to remove the head to examine the lifters/headers ,but the borescope showed no collisions or bent rods. I'm going to rinse the engine with oil before I fully reassemble it to wash the sand out of the lifters. (some rocks where crushed by the camshaft)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0bkkgxsxxpk21.jpg

Timing had clearly Jumped.

&amp;#x200B;

The car is sitting in my brothers garage in apex NC, Ive been on the road since January for work , and wot be home till mid march. I will post an update once work resumes and a video of its first restart.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice/anything i should check, please tell me. Im an amateur.

I was secretly staring at my crush in class as I usually do... I was secretly staring at my crush in class as I usually do, but then I started to get hornier and hornier until I reached my apex, my maximum threshold. I had no choice, but to carefully slide my phone down my pocket and ask the teacher to go to the bathroom. She's that teacher who never lets you go to the bathroom, but for some reason, she said yes this one time. I carefully walked to the door. When I got out of the classroom I went into full Usain bolt mode and rushed to the bathroom. When I got into the bathroom I pulled out my phone faster than any man has ever pulled out a phone before. I opened the PornHub app (yes I have the app). I went into my favorites list and found the perfect video. It was a video of a prison officer SLAM DUNKIN' two prostitutes. I'll give link if u want. I went full maximum overdrive on that dick, I beat my dick like no man has beaten anything before, I beat my dick like my dad beats me (w-wait wot). Within about 3 minutes I nutted on the wall with the sound of gunfire. Just imagine the juggernaut drive from highschool dxd just bustin' a nut. It pretty much looked like a lama had spit on the wall. I went back to class like nuttin' ever happened (heh u get it. nuttin instead of nothing. Anyone, ok, sry).. And the best part is. No one ever knew it was me. 1 year later there is still a mystery about the guy who nutted on the wall inside the school bathroom. It was a rumor that the maid refused to clean it up which I can't really be surprised at, like jeez she ain't gonna be paid minimum wage to clean up the sperm of a student. Like, hell naw. There is still nut stains on the wall to this very day.

3x3 mod vs. stock Summary: The 3x3 mod is detrimental to mid-range performance. Better performance will be achieved by leaving the air box stock.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock air box is designed to provide a mid-range performance boost. This is achieved by using resonance to force air into the engine at a specific RPM range. The manufacture designed the air box so this boost occurs at the same RPM range where torque starts to drop off due to valve overlap.

&amp;#x200B;

Source: [https://motorcycleinfo.calsci.com/Airboxes.html](https://motorcycleinfo.calsci.com/Airboxes.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, when the air intake valve closes, a pressure wave moves from the engine towards the air box compressing the air inside. This then bounces back towards the engine and provides a type of "forced induction". This only works at the RPM range where the returning pressure wave reaches the engine at the same time as the intake valve opens. This will broaden the mid-range power curve while having no impact on WOT or when coming off idle.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this information, the 3x3 mod is not only a useless mod, it's actually detrimental. Consider this... if the air box snorkel can pass more air than the intake valves... how could the snorkel be a restriction? The valves only open every 4th cycle of the engine. The snorkel is always open and passing air.

Jokes about dead pets... that’s a new low So this happened a few weeks ago, and I just want to say, I play minecraft, a lot of people may now think ‘oh my god, is this about a dead coded animal?’ It’s not, don’t worry, I’m not that dumb.

DA = Dumbass
F = Friend (I cant be bothered to type out friend)
ME = Me.

Oh and for the record, I can’t exactly remember how the conversation played out, so bare with me..

A day before this took place, my dog was put down, he was 14 (dog years) and I had had him pretty much my entire life, I was a mess when I found out what had happened.
So me, F, and Da were messing about on this realm, F was in getting wood, I was building a house and Da was being useless. Now I never really like Da even before this happened, and I didn’t know how anyone could, he was some 9 year old kid who was really stupid and insensitive as you’ll see..

Da: ooh, a dolphin is over here, should I capture him?
Me: yeah they exist..
Me: WAIT HIM!?
F: How do you know it’s a him?
Me: Don’t assume!
F: yeah, it could be a they, or a she!!
(Keep in mind, me and F were just joking around completely here)
Me: THAT IS OFFENSIVE!!
F: how dare you!!!
Da: jeez relax, he’s a him now k.
Me: MAYBE ITS A SHE?
Da: are you serious?
Me: OFC I AM!
F: THAT’S SO SEXIST
Da: your lack of brain cells is offensive
Me: ATLEAST WE DON’T ASSUME
(Still joking here, but I think back now and realise that Da didn’t quite get it)
Da: I mean really, it’s like talking to buzzfeed feminists..
Me: how are we feminists specifically?
Me: I’m just saying how you shouldn’t assume at all!
Da: I didn’t say you were feminist so I guess I could whip out the ‘your lack of brain cells is offensive’
Me: (what does that even mean?...)
Da: or you’re just really easily offended people.
F: Da..
F: I find your lack of siblings offensive.
(I asked her what that was about afterwards, she said it was an old inside joke with Da)
Da: oh no, so sad, if only I cared
F: you will care now
F: /Kill :insertDa’sUsernameHere:
Me: you have no friiiieeeeends
(I’m still kidding around here, just a reminder)
Da: and you have no dog.
Me: -goes quiet-
F: YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT
Me: actually, we have another one still...
Da: oh how you planning on killing that one then?
Me: -goes quiet again-
F: [my name] Come to the nether (a place in minecraft if you don’t know)
F: you’ll be safe from DA’s wrath
Da: why are you so stupid?
Da: how would that save her from my ‘wrath’
Da: oh cuz I assumed the dolphin’s gender and that makes me such a bi meanie right.
F: no
Da: it’s almost sad this you know
F: the ‘joke’ about her dead dog
Me: go to hell Da
Da: wow never heard that before.
Me: I was finally getting over it
Me: and you literally just made me start from scratch.
Da: Wot the dog?
Me: yes you dipsh*t
F: Da you can be so ignorant sometimes.
Me: you insensitive peice of crap
F: [my name], want me to ban him?
Da: oh yeah I’m not the favorit here
(Notice how he misspelt favourite)
Da: Everyone hates me.
Me: you choose to ban him or not F because I don’t want to make that decision.
Me: well Da, you’re not exactly gonna be the ‘favorit’ child when you make jokes about dead pets.
F: brb
Me: that dog was older than me
Da: oh real funny making fun of my spelling mistakes
Da: you’re so annoying and rude
Me: it takes one to know one
Da: how stupid can you be?
Me: not stupid enough to make jokes about dead pets.
Da: doesn’t matter you just don’t like me in general.
Me: can’t say you’re wrong
Da: bye bye hope you have fun
Da: I don’t at least
[insert DA’s username] left the game

EB Demands money back after prior agreement This is a story about my sister EB and me (me). A year ago I travelled across the country back to my home state to spent a month with my sister, her husband and toddler. Being a broke ass university student I had little money and some of my friends wanted to catch up. Over this month period EB voluntarily offers to pay for little things like getting me a coffee or lunch sometimes even when I was happy to pay for it.

One night my friends wanted to go out and she said I could use her Uber and pay her back. I do so and we agree I will happily pay her back once I get back home and get some savings. Little to my knowledge she added up every tiny thing she ever bought and wanted me to pay it back. Again..whatever that’s fine, more than happy.

It’s towards the end of my stay and we both came to a mutual agreement that I’ll pay her back in mini payments when I get home. ( yes I’m mentioning it again because we talked about it a few times) for my last week I decide to stay with my mum and on my second last day I message my sister and try to organise coming up to see my nephew before I leave.

Me: hey what are you guys doing tomorrow, it’s my last day and I want to say goodbye to *nephew*

EB: can you send *money amount* to *literally sends me a screenshot of her bank information*

Me: you wot?

EB: you said you would pay me back  for the Uber rides and stuff I bought you.

Me: yeah?...I did...when I got home...we both agreed I’ll pay you back in payments?

EB: I want it now

Me: I don’t have it?

EB: sorry. We’re busy today and tomorrow. You can’t come and say goodbye to *nephew*

Me: wtf?

She doesn’t respond.

I then get a very very angry father (my dad) calling me screaming because she was just on the phone crying to him because and I quote *he stole my bank card as used it on Uber without permission and refuses to pay me back*

I’m literally laughing on the phone while my dad is screaming at me. I hung up and send him screenshots of the conversation and he immediately calms down. I told him I’m more than happy to pay her back. But she had no right to demand it all on my last day and then refuse to let me see my nephew because of it.

My dad ended up giving her the money. And to this day. She is still expecting and asking me to give it to her.

Creep/Man of War Mashup Remix Idea! Ok, so ever since my dad told me Creep is a bad song, i had an epic idea!

Imagine if they combined Creep with another song!

Epic!

Lyrics (to the time of every Radiohead don’t played at once):

When you were here before

Couldn’t look you in the war

Just like in a video game

Big boots make me fly

I wish I was special

So bake me a cake

Put my name on the cake

So it’s a special cake for me

But I’m a dwarf

Poison dwar-arf

You’re my creeper

Made of eyes

She’s

Running out

Of men

Maybe she’ll notice me if I’m the only one left

Epic, right!? Imagine if Colin played it at his next solo show! Maybe with Thm’s head on a stick used as a ventriloquist’s doll to sing they “they should be ringing” intro! And then Andy Yorke could come on stage for the Citizen Erased outro

Certainly beats Thm’s newest leaked single, just him repeating “uh, wot, M o d sele K t ah, blimey beggar man fish the government” ad nauseam (CR78 remix) in his soggy ol British accent. I guess his glory days are over and we should just listen to the 1975. They have the message this generation needs.

Amirite?

I wrote a story for Sci-Fi class. Santiago
OfficerLollipop
	I wake up feeling like I was in a hotel or something. Last night, I had a crazy dream that Mothman and his boyfriend took me away into this weird plane and that I kept smelling something sweet. I pop in my chocolate circle contacts, and pick up my Google Pixel, in a new glitter case, to post about it on Twitter. I see a lot of tweets about eight hundred thousand people being abducted in the night, and I’m too tired to think about it, yet I see that many people had the same dream last night, including some celebrities (For example, Lil Pump, Miranda Cosgrove, Sofia Vergara, Kellyanne Conway, and Jeff Kinney.) I slap on something simple: an artsy Selena t-shirt, a white denim vest, tan jorts, and beaded-up sandals because it’s pretty much all I could find at the moment. I’m 16 and a third today, so what?

	It’s a little more humid than my home in San Diego, and I grab my makeup bag from my purse, and walk down the white hallway, complete with a picture of me and some people I don’t know. Then it hits me. “Welcome to Hell, Alicia V. Madera! Enjoy the buffet.” I think to myself, as I race to the gold-bronze bathroom. I look at myself in the mirror, which takes up half a wall, and brush my teeth in the shallow sink. At least my toffee skin’s clear today, which means only eyeliner, mascara, bronzer, and lipstick could do, to make me look a little like Cardi B.

	As I brush through my leather-black locks, a man knocks on the door. “Lady, lemme in. I’ve gotta pee.” I open the white door, to see a burly, smelly, and pasty 27-year old nerd with small wireframes, a Hershey’s mantail, a size XXL shirt with a girl named Yui Hirasawa from some sort of anime, a Utilikilt, and Birkenstocks with black socks. He gazes at me and seems suspicious.

	“You’re not my mom. Who are you?” I answer with my nickname, Lychee, and the man, Frank, unceremoniously kicks me out of the bathroom. I check Google Maps to see where I am, and the results say, Santiago, Null Island. I almost crash into a tanned dude who’s going downstairs to get some Coco Pops. If it wasn’t for that new Reina makeup, it would have smeared all over his Inspector Gadget shirt.

	“This is heaps sus. What kind of egg pushed yah into me?”

	“This hella chonk Seattleite named Frank did. I don’t think I can trust him right now.”

"That's hayps rude, cuz. chur, I still don't get why I'm out of Chch hell. At least no Pakeha supremacist’s askin’ me ‘Wanna hiding, chur?’."

We introduce ourselves to each other, and Mr. Coco Pops, aka Tayne, scratches his fluffy peroxide undercut, and walks down the oak stairs with me, talking about how weird this whole situation is. In the red living room, a stylish woman who looks like Pearl from Steven Universe, if she dyed her hair black and landed a stressful internship, is standing at the door, calling one of her friends about how she’s not in Osaka anymore. I know now that I have a universal language thingy in my brain because her voice was kinda like a Boston accent to me. I wave to her awkwardly, and we say hi to her, as she turns around, and stands in shock.

“Oy! Youse two speak Japanese pretty well for an American and new Zealandah!” Her friend, with a Cockney accent which was probably from the translator, yells,

“Lawd above, Kinoko, who are yew havin’ a dork wid?” Kinoko keeps talking to her friend, whom I assume is named Min-Young or something. Kinoko gives us a glance and introduces herself to us and we tell us who we are because it’s polite. “So, Tayne, Lychee, wanna go pick up some cawhfee wit' me, or what? My little princess wants tuh meetcha guys! Okay?” She puts her phone in the pocket of her miniskirt and reinstates the offer. Tayne declines, but I’m all for hot vanilla flat white to ease my stress. Thankfully, the coffee shop, Tim Hortons, is a few doors down, and all I can think about is how Kinoko could even stand a brisk walk in a Donald Duck shirt, a kilt-like skirt, and black kitten heels. When we get there, Kinoko opens the door, and waves at a woman with long, straight, dark-chocolate hair and dolly eyes.

“Good mawhnin', Min-Yeong! I’ve got my friend, Lychee, wit' me, if yuh don’t mind! Okay? I can’t believe yuh’re on de island, too! Your Japanese is gettin' bettuh, Min, and you're even tawhkin' in a Kansai accent, like me!” Min-Yeong, a trendy woman in a denim pinafore and striped shirt, invites Kinoko and me over and laughs about how she’s speaking KOREAN, and that Kinoko’s Korean is like hers. She’s drinking a latte and watching a clip from a Bollywood movie on her white Asus laptop. She hugs Kinoko and gives her a little Eskimo kiss. She invites me to sit down to hang out with them, and points to her phone, claiming that Bollywood is real cinema, unlike “dose 'ollywood films everyone in Busan’s obsessed wid”. She’s obviously swooning over this girl on the screen, who’s dressed up as a Parisian bad girl. At last, Kinoko returns with our drinks: vanilla latte for me and black tea for her. Min-Yeong laughs about how we should have gotten a Hawaiian Latte, and points out the badass, Lisa Haydon, claiming that Kinoko looks as beautiful as her.

I look at the TV, as a tall and hoary white woman steps up behind a podium, her bean-shaped cobweb necklace glittering in the sunlight, and her white pantsuit bleached by the camera flashes. The news ticker underneath her says, “June 13th, 2020, 8:30 GMT, Blanche Diamant: Mayor-Minister of Santiago.”

“Good morning, citizens of Santiago. At this moment, I would like to address the influx of new citizens to our city who arrived today, all eight hundred thousand of them. I am relatively surprised by how many people could come here in one day, especially to an island like this with a population of roughly two thousand! I mean, all of us had to change when we heard the news!” Diamant’s speech gets me curious… a little too curious. Was she a part of this abduction plan?

I grab my coffee and zoom out of the Tim Hortons to my house, and tell Tayne. His hair is combed, and he’s now wearing some cargo shorts layered onto jeans and some Red Continentals. He shrugs and goes along with me for the sake of answers. Frank’s playing video games very loudly, and I don’t think he’d be interested. “Yeah, about Diamant. You got to see her mother speech.” I show Tayne the speech, and he kind of sees what’s going on, and explains to me a weird tale about how Blanche was the alien mastermind behind the abductions, and that she’s only in it to see human boys naked or something.

	Around that time, Kinoko and Min-Yeong are chatting their way back to our place, wondering why I went home so early. I tell her about the thing I saw on the TV at Tim Hortons while they were gabbing about Lisa’s makeup, and show her Diamant’s speech. She does seem a tad concerned, but brushes it off a bit, and talks to Min-Yeong about it. Tayne runs up screaming to Frank’s suite and bangs on his door.

	"Frank, bro! Did yah say thaht thing on the news with that lady in the white pantsuit'? it' was displayed all over bloody taown! don't take the [REDACTED], bro! " Frank opens the door, and the smell of Doritos and old socks wafts the white hallway, down to the carpeted bay window bench where I’m talking to Kinoko.

	“Lychee, I don’t know about this Diamant lady. Maybe I’ll have to take a look around town to get a bigger picture. I’ll try and look up somewhere to go on this stupid rock.” While Kinoko is looking around town for a nice shopping center or an arcade where a certain member of the “fauxmily” could go, Tayne walks downstairs, feeling sicked out by the gamer stench. Tayne reports that Frank “took the [REDACTED]” and that “that fat egg” wouldn’t even believe him, even when he told Frank his theory about Diamant being a weirdo. Kinoko gets a text from Min and tells her to meet up with her at the 13th Street Mall.

	A few arguments later, after Frank walks out after being enticed by a trip to a fancy bar with some gaming setups, we walk outside, where the Lyft arrives at the curb. The four of us jump in the modified mauve Mazda, and on the cloverleaf from our neighborhood to the 13th Street Mall, Tayne finds a glimmering pill-shaped tower upon a forested hill. I’m obviously curious, so I asked the driver, a grimy Murdoc clone named Dashton Heimdall, “What’s that giant glass eggplant over there?” Dashton looks away from me, giving a blunt and muttery answer.

“Kid, it’s the Glass Tower, and I think it’s like Diamant’s castle or whatever you might call it.” Dashton turns back to the road and tries to talk to Frank, who’s playing Minecraft on his phone.

At last, we’re at the mall, where protesters litter the streets, yelling about how Diamant’s not open with her people, and how their abduction is still a mystery. Frank walks off to the Point, a gastropub with gaming setups, and the rest of our fauxmily looks on at the protest, behind a taco cart in front of a knickknack shop.

It’s around noon, and Tayne suggests we get something from that taco cart, which intrigues Kinoko, because she’s never had much Mexican food, except for chips and avocado at a Sake party. It also intrigues Tayne, because he only went to Taco Bell once. I am stoked for a burrito right now, and I squeal like I order up a shrimp burrito for Kinoko, some veggie nachos for Tayne, and I get a pork barbacoa burrito. The lady there gives me the price in this weird currency I’ve never heard of.

“That’ll be twelve thousand grist. Cash, check, card, or digital pay, ma’am?” I load up my bank app, and the twelve hundred bucks in my bank account are now six hundred thousand grist, which seems to be the Santiagan currency. I shove my phone to the lady, who doesn’t seem concerned. When I get it back, I think, “the hell they do to my Pixel?” thinking about the currency change.

After eating what I suppose is the weirdest pork barbacoa ever, Frank rushes down the street, bumping into protestors. He sits down on the bench and takes a breath. He tells us of his exploits at the Point and talks about the weird games there.

“Yo, the games there are weird. Not just Katamari and Hiveswap weird, like beyond the stars weird! There’s one about vacuuming up pollution, another about ballet sword-fighting, and there’s one like Fortnite, but you team up with other people and vaporize other players by hugging them!” Frank was freaking out, and I could tell he didn’t want a taco to cheer him up. “You were right, Tayne! Santiago is ruled by aliens!” He was squealing like a little piggy, bent over on the bench, getting the dust from that bench all over Yui Hirasawa’s face. In the corner of my eye, I see Min-Yeong, in that same pinafore and striped shirt, and some Barbie pink ballet flats, typing something on her laptop on a bench. Kinoko proposes,

“I bet she’s coverin' de protest. Ya' dig? Yuh know she’s a political journalist, and a Capricawhn Festivus baby. Right? I’m a Cancuh, July de second… we’ve got a connection, right, or what?” Lovesick Kinoko keeps her eyes locked on Min, and Tayne talks about his birthday, December 2nd, and Frank does the same with his, March 27th, just to joke about Kinoko’s comment. I tell them about how Min could take advantage of her status as a journalist to get the answers from Diamant’s regime, and Frank nods to that. I ponder it for a bit while rubbing the barbacoa juice off my nails with a napkin.

“Y’know, what if these aliens don’t understand journalism? We should think about this for a while.” Before I know it, Min’s across the street, kissing Kinoko, and talking to her about the plan, questioning how they could pull it off, which might need a week’s planning.

The next week, we research Diamant, watching all of Diamant’s interviews, (Min-Yeong actually interviewed her once about the protests) and trying to find out what was going on. On Tuesday, Min-Yeong interviews Diamant about some issues in the city. The two are in easy chairs in a garden of blue flowers in the back of the tower. In this light, Diamant seems more inhuman than she does on the news, especially with that bean-web necklace. The news ticker says their names, Lee Min-Yeong and Blanche Diamant, as is customary.

L: “So, I just finished an article abaht protests and demonstrations at the 13th street mall, wantin’ answers for what’s garn on, and why they ‘arrived’ at the island in the first place. Do ya believe in the kidnappin’ theory?”

D: “It’s plausible, but what kind of human being would like to leave this beautiful island? Santiago is a modern paradise, and if there were kidnappers, they must have had a good heart, you hear?”

L: “Yes, and residents of Santiago ‘ave reported that sum forms of media seem to be beyond ‘uman imagination. A friend of mine claimed dat de games ‘Sword Ballet’, ‘Vacuum-Box’, and ‘Hug Time Battle Royale’ seem ter be made by in’uman intelligent life. Wot are your thoughts on the theory?”

D: “The citizens of Santiago are creative people, Miss Lee. Can we talk about something else, preferably the Grist rate? Some people are curious about that, ok? No off-topic questions, alright?”

Kinoko watches the interview non-stop, maybe because her girlfriend’s the interviewer, or it’s about Diamant. I follow a lot of conspiracy accounts on Twitter, claiming that Diamant was a reptilian who wants to turn the humans she’s kidnapped into cross-eyed people with radioactive skin and symptoms of ADHD and that she wants to take humans inside the Earth and eat them. Well, all I really got was that she’s probably an alien.

That Sunday: protestors and journalists flooded the lawn of the Glass Tower, demanding answers and safe passage back home. Officers are everywhere, spraying a sweet-smelling anesthetic around the crowd to quell the rioters, and taking them to what I assume might be jail. I hold up the collar of my pink palm-tree shirt to ward off the nasty smell, as the rest of my fauxmily plus one waft away the smell of the perfume. Waving our hands in the air, and holding our shirt (or dress, in Kinoko’s case) collars up to our faces, we brave through the sleeping people to talk to the guards.

Two guards with pink hair and what seems to be makeup, outfits similar to hotel bellboys, and bandaids on their foreheads stand in front of the door. Min-Yeong huddles us close, and tells us, “Even if these aliens don't get journalism, we'll Beecham's Pill make an effort ter get in, okay?”

We nodded and stood behind Min as she tried to convince the guards to let her in, and the guards got into a fight:

“Should we?”

“Well, in my world, they always let journalists in.”

“In mine, they don’t!”

“Do humans do it?”

“I guess if this black-haired lady says so. I think she’s being weird.”

“Shut up, Mickey! You broke our cover!”

“You did too, Ryu!”

The fight between the guards got so bad, we have a chance to walk in. Inside, the view’s marvelous. Crystal-blue light illuminates a four-story-tall main room, complete with a fountain, out-of-this-world plants, and people who’re probably aliens talking to one other. An open door leads to a room with what seems to be holograms of parts of the city, including Diamond Park, the 13th Street Mall, the Museum of Space, restaurants, shops, schools, and houses. A sleeping centaur-like alien with horns is in front of the computer, and Tayne and I sneak in to get a good look. "thees is moah sus thahn whaht we'd expect, eh, chur?" I have an internal panic attack right then and there. These aliens spied on us, and we didn’t know. I know this city’s a trick, but this is flippy.

When we get out of that room, Frank tells us to meet up in a cinema-style room with a little movie about the plan, where several aliens and what seemed to be fellow humans sit down and watch a movie about the history of what’s going on.

The movie is about the Galactic Federation plan to build a human zoo, with the overseer, Keigh’ten Bakaln Dim’Ont, a Kyun from the planet Hyoo-wee in the Hyades, disguised as the mayor. Baka looks like a humanoid wiener dog with two tails, purple lips with fangs, and antennae, and thoi seems to have resting [REDACTED] face. Thois plan is to abduct eight hundred thousand humans, spy on them, and determine their worthiness for the Federation.
Right around the end of the movie, I feel Little Red Riding Hood come over for her monthly visit, so I race out of the theatre, shuffle in my bag for something, and try and find a bathroom. I find an entryway that leads to a tiled and spicy-smelling room with stalls with weird vacuums in them and full-body showers that are supposed to be sinks. A supremely familiar voice bumps around the room, and my heart sinks.

“You know how much eight hundred thousand mammalian Galactic Translators cost? Even with the new upgrades, yes! I understand that certain dialects in their language adapt to dialects in ours, but I kind of hate it! Listen, these humans are gullible enough, and the cell service here sucks because they don’t have Serket waves on this planet!” Baka. Thois voice sends my senses into overdrive, and I rush out of the bathroom, with thoir probably seeing me being the only thing on my mind. I frantically text my fauxmily and Min about how I ran into Baka, but it’s too late. A pink-haired “human” grabs me and sprays the sweet stuff onto me.

I wake up in a circular office at the top of the Glass Tower. The view’s so high, I can almost see the Earth’s curvature from here. Tayne, Min, Kinoko, and Frank are there too. Frank is the first one to wake up, and says, “Lychee, where are we?” Baka is at a desk, on the phone with some other alien.

“Yes, bump up the security. Some humans got into the tower. Limit most connections to the rest of their planet. Yeah, I understand we’re a sympathetic organization, so I’ll just allow probably island-only phone service, and what is it, Internet? I also understand trade is important. We’ve got farms! Relax! This will only be in place until,” Baka glares at us. “Until we can get some human ambassadors from that one thing, the United Nations or something. Let me talk to these humans, okay, Nodonav?”

Baka is furious with us five for sneaking into the tower. Thoi takes a sip of a gelatinous drink, tosses it on the floor, and points one of thoir tails at us. “You five… Lee Min-Yeong, Yamada Kinoko, Francis Clarence Schwimmer, Tayne Taika Henry, and Alicia Valentina Madera, you have ruined plans for interplanetary connections! Is a government that keeps secrets not customary on your planet?” I try to speak up, and Baka flips out, telling us that if we expose their secrets, the Federation will have to put us in jail until the UN people come over.

Security is on high alert, and the protests get louder. Tayne is crying that it’s all our fault, and it’s all frowns here in Santiago. It’s like everyone is being held hostage, and the rainy weather this week reflects our sadness and claustrophobia. The riots get worse, and the Glass Tower is a battlefield. All I feel like doing is telling my friends back home that I can’t leave the island, and sending off a message with the Hashtag #UNComeOver like a lot of people are doing across Null Island. Those days last for a long while, with nothing to do but talk to friends, eat the little food that can be produced here, (like coffee, meat, tropical food, and hothouse vegetables) and protest.

On Friday the 27th, planes fly overhead, and land on the runways, and people are cheering and clapping as they land, knowing they’ll be able to go home. The riots cool down as newly trained ambassadors sent from Japan, Ghana, Brazil, Israel, France, New Zealand, and the United States, strut out of a limousine, with journalists like Min, at their side. Kinoko had a press pass, and she streamed what was going on on Twitter. Baka’s dressed up as Blanche, and “she” welcomes the ambassadors with open arms and a banquet of snacks in the “press garden”.

Mari Kaname, the Japanese ambassador, asks “Blanche” about what’s going on, and she said what we heard that Sunday. Jonah Rabinowich, the Israeli ambassador, asks about the Galactic Federation’s mission, and “Blanche” responds about how it’s the same as the UN’s mission. Emily Osborn, the American ambassador, asks about the Zoo project, and why it was necessary. “Federation regulations.” Says Blanche. She says the same [REDACTED] to Fifi Clark, Ignacio González Miranda, Claude Derennes, and Aria Stewart, from Ghana, Brazil, France, and New Zealand, respectively. I check my Twitter, and I see that Kinoko’s livestream is blowing up, even though Min is always on the screen because she loves her. Tayne, Frank, and I are watching it unfold from the Point while playing Aground on a PC hooked up to a TV.

Min reports about how over 200 ambassadors from around the world are arriving at the Glass Tower to discuss plans for Earth to join the Galactic Federation as a member world. The people of Earth have yet to decide, but I hear they’ll have a one week voting period. Well, if they say yes to the offer, don’t be surprised if a flying saucer lands at your local airport, and when there’s a twister, don’t freak out when a clown with grey skin and horns shows up to help you rebuild your house. They say we’ll be classified as a “budding world”, which is like a developing country, but on a planetary scale. If they say no, I bet they’ll keep coaxing us until we say yes.

Big SF Intake - Really high AF Learning I just put on the big sf intake, and flashed the Cobb Stage 1+ tune. I'm worried about running lean and damaging the engine. My AF learning is at 14 consistently while in cruise, and maybe around -5 in idle. I'm new to this, so I'm having a hard time deciphering if this is bad. WOT it zeros out. Can anyone help, or give me your thoughts on this? The car is only at 20k, so I don't think the MAF is dirty. My DAM has also dropped to .87. I do plan on eventually getting an etune.

TIFU by asking an underaged girl for her number Obviously didn’t happen today

It was the summer of 2018, my friends and I had just graduated from high school and we were going to Singapore for a few days. It was a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend going if you have vacation time saved.

We decided to go watch the special light show that was briefly showcased in Crazy Rich Asians, Gardens by the Bay. We show up a few hours early so we can tour the site and walk through the giant hotel with the boat on top, Marina Bay Sands. As we walk towards the light flowers we decide to take pictures to show for our families. I was taking a picture of the hotel when my friend starts laughing his ass off. I ask him “WOT?!?!” like some degenerate child and he remarks that some girl was checking me out.

I am astonished because,
1.	why would someone check me out, I’m wearing shorts that are slightly too small and a shirt that’s slightly sticking to my body because of the heart
2.	I look like I haven’t eaten in days, somehow I lost weight when I went and I am already underweight

I just tell him no way and we continue on our way. We start heading to the lower parts and are turning around towards the escalators when I see this girl who keeps eyeing me up. I ask my friend if it was the girl and he told me yea. I told him as we went down the escalator if I saw her and she eyed me up like a piece of fresh meat I would ask for her number if they gave me 10 SGD. Well as luck would have it as we just got on the descending escalator she got on the ascending one. I just ignored her, praying she didn’t look at me. After she passed us she passed us my four friends start laughing their ass’ off. They basically told me she eye fucked me. Well I had to keep my promise so I haul ass back up the escalator and start looking for her. I spot her and slowly approach her and realise my mistake. She’s young.... She looked maybe 13 at the oldest. “Well i’m gonna look like a pedophile” I told myself. I asked her for her number, but not after she asks her aunt if she can give me her number. I just wanted to jump off the top of the hotel at that point, I almost ran from her. She said no and I briskly walked to my asshole friends dying from laughter.

TL:DR Friends tell me girl is eyeing me up, bet my friends I would ask for her number, turns out she’s underaged, I’m probably on a list now

New FoST owner just experienced temporary low power. I was bringing my daughter to school this morning in my (new to me) 2017 FoST. I was stuck behind a school bus stopping every 50ft for a few miles, other than the constant stop and go I made it to her school, dropped her off and headed home, driving with the flow of traffic.

Finally I get to a clear road and got to get on it a little bit, and it just wouldn't go. Like it accelerated, but it felt like a commuter, it felt like it was in some sort of limp mode. It felt SLOW compared to the last few days, but there were no warning lights. I turn traction control off, and I get on it from a dead stop in first, no fireworks, no torque steer, just a little chirp and easy acceleration, pull it into second and again a little chirp and the same thing.

I'm thinking, so I just got this car, I now have less than 1/8 of a tank, and I don't know what the dealership put in the tank. It shouldn't matter how much fuel I have and I haven't put any other gas in so why would the power drop be fuel related. I decide to just go get gas, knowing that it shouldn't help. So I take it easy, stay off boost and get to the gas station. I fill it with some good old 93, pull out on the road, and go WOT in first, and I am back in business, the car did its little torque steer dance and felt much faster than just 10 minutes before.

What could have caused this? Was it really the gas or was it turning the car off and back on? Is there some sort of limp mode that doesn't give a warning? I am somewhat concerned now.

Clutch kick. Well if you are new to the game and haven't been using it, you should.

Extremely helpful for pulling a car out of understeer.  For example you come up to a hairpin and pull the e brake you think you have enough of an angle to exit the corner under wide open throttle. Sometimes when I get on the throttle to soon I realize that I have either not achieved the proper angle of slide or I haven't progressed through the turn enough.  I combat this by clutch kicking and it will just pull the car right out! Go figure!  On very technical tracks with plenty of switchbacks it's almost a repetitive  task of  e brake into clutch kick into WOT. Try it out.

Nothing... Happened... (1000 day box post, yay !) WHAT YA READIN AT YA WEE POSH C*NT ? WE GONNA MAKE A PROPA BOX POST OR WOT ?

*hum hum*

Hello ladies and gents, pitanger here for dat 1000 day box post.

Lots of things happened since [my last box post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTC/comments/7v1bb3/tis_le_600_day_box_post/) : ~~the gilets jaunes are infesting my country and they did surgery on a grape~~ I pulled so many units but at the same time have so many regrets, for I have betrayed the almighty Carrot sama. (it's okay, I'll earn some money soon so I'll probably compensate like that. Probably).

LET'S START FROM WHERE THIS PREVIOUS POST LEFT OFF SHALL WE

Alright so after getting all those legends I knew I had to spare my gems for 3rd anni AND I SURE HOPED THIS ONE WOULD BE GOOD FOR ONCE, in the meantime, Bandai gifted us with new legend packs, and this is the story of how I got [Future 7* Art Doffy](/qck) and [Worse Carrot](/dex). But nobody cares right, you're here for the BIG BOIS, so let's 👏 jump 👏 into it 👏.

OPTC THIRD ANNIVERSARY ! First multipull : [Sabo V2](/str) aaaaand thanks for watching guys I'll be livestreaming tomorrow at eleven thirt-wait that's not it actually. I also got [G4 v0.5](/qck), [Dead](/dex), [Injection Rehash but this time it's cerebral and not a slasher despite using a f*cking sword and this title is way too long](/qck) and [OG Shooter meta boi](/dex). Gotta admit, first multi Lucy with the atrocious rates was probably the luckiest I would ever be in this effing game. BUT WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS THE KAMI FOR GOD'S SAKE !

Then came the final one of the OG Blitz Battles, and was happy to pull two new units : [Hakuba Matata](/qck) and [Lucci but flipped horizontally](/qck). WHO THE F CARES WHERE IS KAMI THOUGH

Time passed. TM came around. Free Enel came around. Then I went to farming FN Hawki-wait

wait

WHAT

[FREE KAMI](/qck)??? [AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTC/comments/8ofmyf/free_legend_to_choose/e0309pq/)

I can die in peace now. Thanks mom (and Bandai, sometimes you're cool).

Aaaaanyway, back to sparing gems between 3rd anni and 3rd French anni. Do you 'member all these people not believing in the French anni ? 'Cause I 'member. But it was real.

3rd French anniversary. The legend pack got me [Relieved after pooping](/int), ok enough with the bad jokes, on to the pulls :

So remember when I said 1st multi Lucy was the luckiest I would ever be in this game ? Well this time, in my first multi I got [something that I don't even have to write down](/str) [because the color code on this sub is convenient](/qck). On top of that I got a bunch of other stuff : for some reason a multipull gave be two [Pinocchios](/dex) so I could enjoy both 6 and 6+ versions, also got [not voiced](/dex), [some korean shit](/dex), [wasted limit break V1](/psy), one [dry boi](/dex) and [Sorry SirVampyr, I was so hungry](/psy). Also we got another free legend so I was able to get a [non-speedy fesh](/int). Pretty good French anni init *sips tea* [*remembers that he's French*].(https://i.imgflip.com/2610cc.jpg)

Next CYO came [two weeks after French anni ended](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTC/comments/98t9cc/how_i_feel_about_the_upcoming_cyo/) sooo... Yeah, clever move Bandai but you won't have my money hahaha... Wait what are these LRRs doing in my box...

Anyway, back to the legends. After that was (I believe ?) another Blitz Battle in which I got [DA BIRB](/qck). After that, TM Red posters arrived on GLB, and oh my, is that [a legend some mod here might be interested in ?](/psy), I don't know, just speculating huhu.

Around this time, not exactly sure when, I got a dupe [Blucci](/qck) (yeah I'm tired of finding puns) and his 6+ came not so long ago. Insta pentamaxed.

Another TM reward ! Can't stop them now, it's [a cool boi](/qck)

*dadum dadum dadum dadum dadum dadum dadum dadum dadum* WORLD CLASH EVENT WOOOOOOOOO EVERY JP PLAYERS SELLING THEIR KIDNEYS AND KIDS PERIOD IN ORDER TO BEAT GLB WHILE I DON'T CARE AND GET [6+ LOG LUFFY](/psy)

^^^^Around ^^^^some ^^^^weeks ^^^^later ^^^^I ^^^^got ^^^^[Sengoku](/psy) ^^^^but ^^^^who ^^^^the ^^^^fuck ^^^^cares ^^^^even ^^^^I ^^^^don't ^^^^remember ^^^^how ^^^^I ^^^^got ^^^^him

Here comes the finish line, 4th anniversary is approaching, but hey, might as well get [non-pepe Sonic Titan](/psy) from a free pull while I'm at it (and I have his whole family... EXCEPT THAT FREAKING POISON BICH

600... 700... 800 spared gems... Must... resist... for... the fluff...

"GUARANTEED [V45 WHITEBEARD (according to Toadskii)](/qck) AFTER 9 MULTIS"

...

Guess I'll ~~die~~ pull.

Part 1 was horrible. 9 multis and nothing but V2 Whitebeard. Part 2, 3 and reruns though.

Part 2 : I finally got my boi 🅱[ranky](/qck), [The freezier boi](/psy) and [another non-slasher swordsman](/int). 3 good pulls : Franky was my 2nd white whale after Enel, wanted V2 Aokiji to try some future Carrot teams and V2 Shanks is just V2 Shanks. Funny enough : V2 Aokiji wasn't featured in this part.

And you know who weren't featured in part 3 ? [x500 EoT](/int) and [Debatably the worst mother ever](/str)... SO HOW THE HELL DID I GET BOTH ??? (and and I also got [some exhibitionist](/dex) )

Parts rerun, I pull randomly but mostly on part 2 BECAUSE I WANT THE BIRBEARD THE MOCHI BOI ! And guess what ? I GET EVERYTHING BUT THE BIRBEARD AND THE MOCHI BOI è_é This includes [underrated movie legend](/qck) (PS : it's not Tesoro.), [WOBIN CHWAAAAN](/psy) ሁሠሁ, also a [useless Shooter captain](/psy) and uuuuuh... [Log Luffy](/str). Just. Just Log Luffy. And yes, it was new. And yes, it's also the end folks.

This is my life now, I have all non-limited RRs except Carina and Reiju. Twice. Fuck her.

Legends missing : They are basically only post Lucy legends : a dupe Judge, V2 Doffy, V2G4, Tesoro, Katakuri, V2 Sanji, WB/M and Brook. I just hope for the best when Carrot comes on GLB.

It’s an extremely long one. Part 2 Chapter Twelve
Genesis 12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
Genesis 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis 12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Genesis 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Genesis 12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis 12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
Genesis 12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis 12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
Genesis 12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
Genesis 12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
Genesis 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Genesis 12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
Genesis 12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
Genesis 12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
Genesis 12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
Genesis 12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
Genesis 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Genesis 12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Genesis 12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

Chapter Thirteen
Genesis 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
Genesis 13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis 13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
Genesis 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis 13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis 13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Genesis 13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
Genesis 13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
Genesis 13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Genesis 13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
Genesis 13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
Genesis 13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
Genesis 13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
Genesis 13:15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
Genesis 13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
Genesis 13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
Genesis 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

Chapter Fourteen
Genesis 14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
Genesis 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
Genesis 14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
Genesis 14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis 14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
Genesis 14:6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
Genesis 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
Genesis 14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
Genesis 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
Genesis 14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Genesis 14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Genesis 14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Genesis 14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
Genesis 14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
Genesis 14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
Genesis 14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
Genesis 14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
Genesis 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
Genesis 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
Genesis 14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
Genesis 14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Genesis 14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis 14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Genesis 14:24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

Chapter Fifteen
Genesis 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
Genesis 15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
Genesis 15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Genesis 15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
Genesis 15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
Genesis 15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
Genesis 15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
Genesis 15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis 15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
Genesis 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
Genesis 15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
Genesis 15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
Genesis 15:14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
Genesis 15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Genesis 15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
Genesis 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
Genesis 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
Genesis 15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
Genesis 15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
Genesis 15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

Chapter Sixteen
Genesis 16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
Genesis 16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis 16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
Genesis 16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Genesis 16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.
Genesis 16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
Genesis 16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Genesis 16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Genesis 16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
Genesis 16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Genesis 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
Genesis 16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
Genesis 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
Genesis 16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis 16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Genesis 16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

Chapter Seventeen
Genesis 17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
Genesis 17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
Genesis 17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
Genesis 17:4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
Genesis 17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
Genesis 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Genesis 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
Genesis 17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
Genesis 17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
Genesis 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
Genesis 17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
Genesis 17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis 17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
Genesis 17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
Genesis 17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
Genesis 17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
Genesis 17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
Genesis 17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
Genesis 17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
Genesis 17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
Genesis 17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Genesis 17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

Genesis 17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis 17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

Chapter Eighteen
Genesis 18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis 18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
Genesis 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Genesis 18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Genesis 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
Genesis 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
Genesis 18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
Genesis 18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
Genesis 18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
Genesis 18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
Genesis 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Genesis 18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
Genesis 18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
Genesis 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
Genesis 18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis 18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
Genesis 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
Genesis 18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
Genesis 18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
Genesis 18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
Genesis 18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
Genesis 18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis 18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
Genesis 18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
Genesis 18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
Genesis 18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:
Genesis 18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
Genesis 18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
Genesis 18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
Genesis 18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
Genesis 18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
Genesis 18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

Chapter Nineteen
Genesis 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
Genesis 19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
Genesis 19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
Genesis 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
Genesis 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
Genesis 19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
Genesis 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
Genesis 19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
Genesis 19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
Genesis 19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
Genesis 19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
Genesis 19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
Genesis 19:13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
Genesis 19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
Genesis 19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
Genesis 19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
Genesis 19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
Genesis 19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:
Genesis 19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
Genesis 19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
Genesis 19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
Genesis 19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
Genesis 19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
Genesis 19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
Genesis 19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
Genesis 19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis 19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
Genesis 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis 19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
Genesis 19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Genesis 19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Genesis 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis 19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis 19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis 19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis 19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Genesis 19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Genesis 19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

Chapter Twenty
Genesis 20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Genesis 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
Genesis 20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
Genesis 20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
Genesis 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Genesis 20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
Genesis 20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
Genesis 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
Genesis 20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
Genesis 20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
Genesis 20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
Genesis 20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
Genesis 20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
Genesis 20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
Genesis 20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
Genesis 20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
Genesis 20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

Chapter Twenty One
Genesis 21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
Genesis 21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis 21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
Genesis 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Genesis 21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
Genesis 21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
Genesis 21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
Genesis 21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis 21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
Genesis 21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
Genesis 21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
Genesis 21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Genesis 21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
Genesis 21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Genesis 21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
Genesis 21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
Genesis 21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Genesis 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
Genesis 21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
Genesis 21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
Genesis 21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
Genesis 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
Genesis 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.
Genesis 21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
Genesis 21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
Genesis 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
Genesis 21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis 21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
Genesis 21:30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
Genesis 21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
Genesis 21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
Genesis 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

It’s an extremely long one. Part 6 Chapter Forty Four
Genesis 44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
Genesis 44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
Genesis 44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
Genesis 44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Genesis 44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
Genesis 44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
Genesis 44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
Genesis 44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
Genesis 44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
Genesis 44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
Genesis 44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
Genesis 44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
Genesis 44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
Genesis 44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis 44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
Genesis 44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
Genesis 44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
Genesis 44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
Genesis 44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
Genesis 44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
Genesis 44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
Genesis 44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
Genesis 44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
Genesis 44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Genesis 44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
Genesis 44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
Genesis 44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
Genesis 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
Genesis 44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Genesis 44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
Genesis 44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
Genesis 44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
Genesis 44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
Genesis 44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

Chapter Forty Five
Genesis 45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
Genesis 45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis 45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
Genesis 45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Genesis 45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
Genesis 45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
Genesis 45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
Genesis 45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
Genesis 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
Genesis 45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
Genesis 45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Genesis 45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
Genesis 45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Genesis 45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
Genesis 45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
Genesis 45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
Genesis 45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Genesis 45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Genesis 45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's.
Genesis 45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
Genesis 45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
Genesis 45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
Genesis 45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
Genesis 45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
Genesis 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
Genesis 45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
Genesis 45:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

Chapter Forty Six
Genesis 46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis 46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
Genesis 46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
Genesis 46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
Genesis 46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis 46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
Genesis 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
Genesis 46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

Genesis 46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
Genesis 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
Genesis 46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
Genesis 46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
Genesis 46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
Genesis 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
Genesis 46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
Genesis 46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
Genesis 46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

Genesis 46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
Genesis 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
Genesis 46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Genesis 46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis 46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.
Genesis 46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
Genesis 46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Genesis 46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
Genesis 46:34 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

Chapter Forty Seven
Genesis 47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
Genesis 47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
Genesis 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
Genesis 47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?
Genesis 47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
Genesis 47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
Genesis 47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
Genesis 47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
Genesis 47:14  And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
Genesis 47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
Genesis 47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
Genesis 47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
Genesis 47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
Genesis 47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
Genesis 47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
Genesis 47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
Genesis 47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
Genesis 47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
Genesis 47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
Genesis 47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
Genesis 47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
Genesis 47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
Genesis 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
Genesis 47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
Genesis 47:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
Genesis 47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.

Chapter Forty Eight
Genesis 48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Genesis 48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
Genesis 48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Genesis 48:4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Genesis 48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
Genesis 48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Genesis 48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
Genesis 48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
Genesis 48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Genesis 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Genesis 48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
Genesis 48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Genesis 48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
Genesis 48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
Genesis 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
Genesis 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Genesis 48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
Genesis 48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
Genesis 48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
Genesis 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis 48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Genesis 48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

Genesis 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

Genesis 49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
Genesis 49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
Genesis 49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
Genesis 49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
Genesis 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
Genesis 49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
Genesis 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
Genesis 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
Genesis 49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

Genesis 49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
Genesis 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
Genesis 49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
Genesis 49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
Genesis 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
Genesis 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Genesis 49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
Genesis 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
Genesis 49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Genesis 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

Genesis 50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

Genesis 50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

Genesis 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
Genesis 50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
Genesis 50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Genesis 50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
Genesis 50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

Biting heads off is the best superpower. Ok. A little post on why i think the ability to bite heads off is the best superpower there is. People are always like "ayy i wanna fly go invisible if i had superpowers" but no, the ability to bite off ones head is simply the most powerful, frightening and effective superpower there is. Picture this, you're at school and in an argument with someone whom you really dont like. They wont shut the fuck up and you cant stand it, so you lean in and simply whisper "u wot m8" as your jaws extend to an incredible size and your incisors morph into 6 inch dagger sized canines as you clamp your jaws shut around the fuckhead's head. You stare triumphantly as his headless faceless corpse falls to the ground with a slight smirk on your now normal face. Everyone else just stares in horror. Some girls scream, the teacher rushes in,  and calls the police. No worries, you bite their heads off too. Everyone is shocked. People dont even try to stop you because they're just too damn afraid. The principal expels you. You go to her office, and bite her head off. The next day you appear in class. Everyone stops what they are doing as they look at you. No one questions your presence, no one says anything if you dont do your work, no one tries to annoy you or oppose you, because you'd just bite their head off. Now picture this, its lunch break and people are talking too much. This annoying guy is sitting with his butt on YOUR table. Thats right, YOUR table. But this time, you dont bite his head off, you stand up, take in a deep breath, and loudly announce "I...am hungry..". The entire class stands still in horror. Everyone's looking at your eyes to see the potential victim, however, you turn to him, and smile. Do nothing but smile. Before you can make a move, he has collapsed. And that is why biting heads off is simply the single most effective superpower the average teenager needs. No one's gonna mess with you. Everyone's your bitch. You're unstoppable. All heads are yours. See a guy thats minding his own business but HOW DARE HE BREATHE YOUR AIR. Bite his head off. Why say "fuck off" when you can say "Ill bite your head off"? In short, you bite heads off, you're the boss.

I(30M) and my partner (28F) have broken up. I need some feminist/equalist advice from objective third parties. My exes think I'm emotionally abusive and I’m inclined to believe them or to think that perhaps it is them. In this specific relationship example; is one or both of us abusive? WOT TLDR
I have been in three long term relationships over the past ten years. 19-present. I know I’ve had codependency issues as the first two relationships, three and five years respectively, both ended with screaming, shouting, and in the second, an arrest, unwarranted, with no charges pressed, of which I was innocent.
I also have drug problems, kind of. I use. I don’t get addicted. I stop. But I don’t have a ton of money and I don’t blow all my money on drugs just some.
I took about six months out of dating to work on some issues I was having. I worked out my issues and i got back on track.

Then, I met Them. I told them everything about my past and what I’d been through and who I was.
They knew everything about me even that I was still legally married to the second wife though separated.
For three months we just fucked and went on dates.
I started to have feelings and I asked them to be my partner.. (3months)
They said yes.
A year and a half went by.
Called them by my exes name twice. (5 and 6 months)
At 7 months with them I started using kratom.
At 9 months cannabis.
 At ten months amphetamine, medical use not abuse but I think I should mention it.
Through all of these changes we were good so I don’t think they’re exactly relevant.
I had to move to a city further from them than before(One hour to one and a half hours).  I had no money and a dog.  They loaned me 1000 which I have yet to pay back.  I also spent 200 dollars on cocaine for their birthday party (17 months) without paying them back yet from money I had earned separately.  All of their money went towards the rent no abuse of funds.  Solid reason to be upset though still.(3 months without any payment).  I had plans to pay them back with my tax return.  That hasn't happened yet but nonetheless they expressed to some friends feeling fucked over in this way.
Then we got hit by a drunk driver while moving some final things to the new living place. My car was totaled and undrivable. Insurance was slow with the payout due to police report delays. This only contributed to our declining situation. We missed Christmas and New Years together. Then we missed a couple more weekends. And we were in physical pain.
This person and I had made time every weekend for over a year to see each other and after the drunk driver we weren’t seeing each other for three to four weeks.
Our relationship had become long distance.
We struggled against this. I wanted to see them. I began to tactfully use phrases like “I miss you” “Come see me” and the like to convey to them how I felt about her. They began to take the bus.
They then began doing something odd.
They started scheduling over our planned hangouts. (14months)
A friend here. Her mom there. They live with their mom so I didn’t think it was that big of an issue to let her know about our pre existing plans and my feelings on their day before cancellation, and schedule for a day that doesn't require cancelling on me or at least invite me to come.
Then they almost never had time  3-5 weeks between visits.
This happened consistently and i began to feel neglected. Then I began to doubt myself and I felt like my reasonable needs of seeing my partner once a week were unreasonable. I was lashing out for attention. It occurs to me now that they made me feel that way about my expressing my needs. Holy shit. I had not thought of it like that before.
Continuing, we kind of worked through things, and made some changes.
We were on the phone chatting and playing some question quiz that lead to love. We chatted on the phone everyday for most of our relationship. Always taking time to call or at least text goodnight etc. . We went through their side of the questions. They expressed their problem and I gave my advice. Then they asked me my questions. They said I was taking too long and became very angry after I expressed my problem. When I got to the express a problem part I expressed the neglect and neediness then I asked  their advice and she starts fucking yelling at me.(Breakup One)(One week before break up two)

Then they broke up with me then somehow we were back together again. I can’t even comprehend how right now.
Things get good over the weekend. We’re calling we’re texting. I address the issue with understanding. They understand. They decided to come on Sunday, asks me to take them to a job interview, i take them, then they say they got the job and they've been invited for the new hire dinner. They then call our friend X and schedule a fucking play date which I found humiliating. This arranged hang out lead to me being around heroin, because X was on it, and failing on a commitment to myself not to use that I had kept for two years and three months. I was vulnerable and needy and my friend had something close to my drug of choice when I feel that way, heart-broken, morphine, alleviates my heartbreak; he had heroin.(Extremely unstable coping mechanism) Theye offered because they said they could see I was hurting. I was hurting and I made a fucking horrible choice. What if parallel universe theory is correct and there’s a universe where I did die, theres always an od risk with heroin. I’m such an asshole man. In my worldview, I created a universe where I made the choice to use a deadly drug and died of a heroin overdose leaving them to wonder if it was their fault, both they and x. Then they cancel spending time with me to spend time with the friend who got her the job which I understand and support. I’ve been feeling neglected and so we do more heroin. Sorry about the timeline fuckups here. I usually use kratom and suggested we go to my house so I could dose. He offered  me heroin and because of my emotional vulnerability I did it.. They dont notice anything with me but asks about X. I told them he took way too much kratom.(LIE) We take an Uber home. On Monday i wake up and i go to work while she does freelance work  stuff online.  then on Monday when I get home they ask me to take them home by vehicle rather than the bus as planned. Then they call our friend X who is there according to them to make sure I don’t fall asleep on the way back. I suspect it may have been to arrest any conversation.  They asked me to drive her an hour and a half on a work night when I have the morning shift and I fucking agree man. I ducking agree and I let  X come along because they(partner) pushed it on me. I didn't set a clear boundary that I was not okay driving them home and that I did not want to be around X anymore, I no longer consider them a friend.
A because we were having problems and I thought this would show them that I'm willing to satisfy their needs and B that if I told her why I no longer wanted to be around X because that would require me to reveal that I had used heroin(Emotional manipulation / lies) But I’m pissed at X for enabling me to use heroin and i don’t want to be around him at all. Nor do I want to be held accountable for a stupid choice I made privately and without causing harm to others. Despite my parallel universe views in this universe I lived. I agree any way. I violate my boundaries. I drop her off. It’s fucking anticlimactic.

She also told me that even if I was on drugs she would not leave.  I suppose everyone has limits but she didn't know about the drugs.
I drive home.
X does some fucking heroin in the bathroom.
She doesn’t know that X is using heroin.
I do because I can see the itching and the flushing and the euphoria and it’s pissing me off.
I get her home finally. Love you sweet dreams good night. Get home no sleep. Chat on the phone with them things are good. Go to work. Get home at four sleep until 12;30 the next day. Through my fucking morning shift at the job I love that they think is taking me nowhere. I am actually sick and go to the dr for a note things are okay.  I explain both the sickness and my aspirations with the company.  They(partner) says she understands that I am part of a growing company and I am hoping for internal promotion  They are happy with this.

We make plans to go to the museum.
I tell them that I can’t afford tickets but I can rent them from the library.
We’re ecstatic.
Then on Friday they blows me off. Says that they're not coming on Saturday because I’m too poor to send them money. I send the money immediately because I saved it for this not because I didn’t have any.
We start arguing over all this bullshit I’ve told you about. Except the heroin. Only you know about the heroin reddit.

Then I started yelling. It was brief but still man I fucking yelled. I feel so stupid. The cherry on ducking top is probably that they're always going to remember the time I screamed at them. They started yelling at me too. We decided to break up again.

It’s weird because during the 36 questions it was fucking clear that they loved me very much and I them. Even with all that love we felt like we had to break up.  That blows my mind,. I just didn't want to be neglected or made to feel like I was needy by craving consistency from my partner. We fucking devolved like this over four months because of the drunk driver.

I fucking hate drunk drivers.

ButI kind of fucking hate myself right now man. Why did we yell at each other?  We’ve never done that.

**This person. The one whom I love. Said that I was emotionally abusive. That their eyes were open wide and now that now that they knew they couldn’t hide from what they saw. They also said they were walking on eggshells.**

The reason I’m here on relationship advice even though my relationship is over is simply
**Am I an abusive person?**
I’ve never hit or wanted to harm anyone.  But I want to start getting help if I am and I don't know where to start.
**Am I an emotionally manipulative person?** I know hiding the drug use is but what about what they're aware of?  The other stuff you know.
If so can you guys help me with resources to begin the change from abuser to healthy partner if that's what I am?

Has anyone here dealt with anything like this?  That’s a lot of fucking canaries, ex-girlfriends, dying man and I’m the fucking miner.

I don’t want to lie to anyone. I don’t want to be in a relationship for at least a year now. But I want to find out if this is fixable or permanent, and I want to change.

We don’t need to focus on the drugs. I know I have a problem. I’m looking at buying the smart handbook when I get the money. 12 steps feels inauthentic and has no programs for gentle abstinence or harm reduction.
I am not currently using and have not since the initial episode (9 days).  Everyones got to start somewhere.

TLDR: good relationship. Once a week visits every week for 80 weeks. Hit by drunk driver. Not able to drive to pick them up. They discover other uses of her time. I make a poor choice regarding my health. They think they're going places because they got a freelance gig. They break up with me saying I’m not going anywhere. I get depressed and am presented with a friend clearly on heroin which triggers my choice to use.  Bad friend. No longer friends. We get back together. Break up again because I’m a emotional manipulator, abusive, and looking for mothering.(According to her.)

**Please Help me figure this out and what I need to do to be a better person?** Clearly the hard drugs need to go and so does X. I can’t be friends with someone who will put me in the position of being able to ask or be offered heroin. I thought I could hang but I can’t.

Main Questions:
**Am I an abuser?**    (In the emotional sense)
**Am I emotionally manipulative?**    (Besides hiding my drug use)
**Am I looking for mothering?**      (Really don't know what is meant by this)
**Can you help me understand walking on eggshells?**  (I know it means a person feels like someones going to pop off and I'm looking for more anecdotes from people who have felt this way and why more so than definitions.)

Sorry about the wall of text.

I'm off Lyft as soon as Uber clears me - PPZ are a joke. Also I have a question about some things I've been seeing in this sub... PPZ started last Monday (for just some drivers maybe?).  Knew it was gonna be bad, but this is EVIL.

Income instantly dropped 15%.  As any driver worth their salt does, I have had my route down to a science the past couple months.  I know where to be and when to be there.  Never a day where I don't hit at least one PT ride, and most I was 3 to 7 here in Atlanta.   Might not Always be huge bonuses, but there nonetheless.

2 days in a row, not a single bonus. Since Saturday, 2.  Unheard of.  I am always in the thick of it, because I know how the city flows.  I took 20% more rides today than I normally do, and made $40 less.

Lyft took a somewhat transparent system and replaced it with Harry Potter bullshit.  But of course we all know PPZ sucks.  And it's all we (I?) have in Atlanta.   I'm also reaching out to news orgs to see who will be interested in these changes that have pushed 6 drivers I know (good drivers) to Uber (4 weren't even dual-driving!) and another 2 just leaving rideshare altogether until/unless I get my network moving, which may not happen since I can't afford to keep doing this now.

Ya ya boohoo whatever - but I do have a question for everyone.


I am seeing posts from people still on PT, And still on power zones?  Is Lyft selecting people to target with this crap, or what?

I have only been on platform since mid November.  900+ rides, perfect rating, ridiculous number of positive comments, according to LYFT's own support team.   I rock interior and exterior Lyft-pink LED lights, and my car is pimped out, Pax love me.  Honestly as pissed as I am about the loss of income and flat out evil policies, I am more so shocked and deflated.  I just can't believe the non-stop evil and greed coming from all directions brothers, it's a bit much!

I mean, am I being punished for being awesome or something?  Does anyone know if Lyft selectively targets people for this nonsense?  I did have a relatively high number of cancels for a while, mainly due to Pax playing whack-a-surge with me, and Pax that request a ride in a close-ish locsiton, then change to 17 minute pickup.  And yes, maybe 15% of those cancels were purposeful when I made a mistake accepting a ride when I was sitting in a surge area.  Acceptance rate 60% last few weeks because everytime I am downtown after having braved 20 minutes of traffic from the airport to get back to midtown, all Lyft wants to send me are shared pickups 24 minutes in the DIRECTION I JUST CAME FROM, like who is gonna do that nonsense?

Honestly this is sooooooo messed up that I can barely wrap my head around its purpose.  Jesus I've worked for some companies that have done their people dirty, but this is next-level shit here.

Really interested in answers to those questions though, for real.  Sorry for WoT 😔

2005 Nissan 350z Electrical Shorting  I have a 2005 Nissan 350z drift car with manual transmission. It has a full exhaust, interior is mostly gutted, tuned ECU, welded diff, hydro e-brake, etc. I am fairly skilled at mechanical work, but not with electrical issues.


I had this car for a couple months, drifted it occasionally/drove it 4x a week to work it for 2-3 months.


Then, all of a sudden, if you drop the clutch at a DEAD stop, car will die. I will rev to 4k, drop the clutch, car will spin tires, move about 10 feet and last 2-3 seconds, and then die.

Afterwards, it'll crank but not start. The IPDM relay box will have no power going to the fuel pump INSIDE the IPDM (tested with voltmeter) and ECU/ECM. Radiator fans turn on full blast and fuel pump does not prime if ignition turned to ON. All relays tested and work fine.
Once you replace the IPDM relay box, car will start up fine and drive. I can rev to redline and accelerate WOT without issues. I even spun the car around a corner starting at about 5mph and had no issues.


I replaced the fuel pump originally, hot wired it, replaced alternator, got battery and alternator checked, but cannot seem to find the issue. Car shows no codes and I do not have many electrical testing tools and since the car runs perfectly UNTIL it happens, I don't know how to troubleshoot. I took out all fuses pertaining to safety measures (airbag, ABS, traction control, security system, etc) and continue to have the problem.

I have heard some guesses saying that the fuel pump is the issue and that a clog or weak pump may cause the car to die under heavy load. However, why would this cause a short? Wouldn't I throw misfiring codes WOT? I have no fueling symptoms except for it is slow to fill the gas tank.


Any help in the correct direction, whether it's a reputable place, diagnostic tools, or points in the correct direction are greatly appreciated!

A Morky Fink Peece about Big Bonez an' if dey Green (Orruk Feory) # An Inquiry into da big bonez: if they’z green, da best or both

By Burg, from Da Bonesplitta tribe 'da Finky ‘eads'

&amp;#x200B;

*The following piece of writing was found in the journal of a deceased Free-Guild outrider. It is believed that the outrider served as the ‘scribe’ for a tribe of Bonesplitterz until his demise, and the following extract has been reproduced exactly.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Green is da best”. Dis is a true we all agree but in dis essay we’z gonna fink about da weird contradiction between dis sayin’ an’ our way of getting WAAAAAAARGH energy from big bonez. Brainy boy prophetz say that WAAAAAARGH energy iz in bonez of big fings. And zog it if it ain’t true, we all feel da power of da WAAAAAAAARGH when we stab a big beastie, like when me and me gitz went propa daft afta we bonked a Lightning Lad’z dragon on da ‘ead (in fact ME ‘ead was bangin’ fer a few moons afta from dat WAAAAAAAAAARGH, it wuz a good ‘un). So if da supposition of beastie bonez ‘olding WAAAAAAARGH energy is true, we ‘it a funny fink (not literal, you can’t ‘it a fink but you can ‘it a ‘ead. Or can you? Maybe dis will be me next experiment. Anywayz). If green is da best and so is WAAAAAAARGH, we got to ask question: are bonez green?

So me and me gits decided ta investigate dis hypothesis. Da first test wuz ta get big bonez. Dis stage of da experiment wuz 'arder den excepted coz me gitz kept breakin’ da bones so we could ‘ave a WAAAAARGH. And it wuz a good WAAAARGH but by da time we were on our 5th WAAAARGH and getting’ no closer ta answering questions I had to bonk me gitz’ ‘eads an’ promise we do a WAAAAAAARGH later, afta da experiment. So wiv dat decided we ‘ad our first test of whevver bones green or not green.

Afta decidin' how ta approach da question we funk da best test wuz ta look at da bonez and see if dey looked green. Me and me gitz both looked: da bones didn’t seem green, but what if it was a green we ain’t seen before? Me brainiest weirdnob sed we should approach da problem wiv structuralizm (drawing on da work of Boss Ferdinund Da Saussuurr). Ain’t enuff ta look at a fing and fink on whever itz green, ya got ta look at other fings we know iz green and see if we canz spot a structural relationship between da two. So we shoved da Morkiest git around da tribe down next to da bonez and compared da green git wiv da maybe-green bone. We looked ‘ard. Me and my gitz came back wiv a unanimous result: we’z knew da git was green and da bone wuz different to da git. Dis seemed like da breakfroo we were all zoggin’ waitin’ for.

However, one of me other gitz sed we should look at da problem like da Weirdnob Skeptic Durvid Hurme would. Hurme sez dat we can’t trust sense data (dis iz wot he callz ‘epistemic skepticizm’. Zoggin ‘ard word, me know): ‘ow do we know wot we fink is green is actually green? Dis did give one of me other gitz da willies when we told ‘im. He gots scared dat all da boyz he’z eva krumped might not be real, just some cunnin’ sense data from Mork or sumfink.  But we told him dat even if dey wuzn’t real, da git still ‘ad a WAAAAAARGH and becuz WAAAAAAAAARGH is da best dat just meanz dat da sneaky sense data is betta dan da ‘real’ fing.  Dis seemed to calm ‘im down, which wuz weird so we’z ‘ad a quick bonk so dat we could proceed da trialz in a propa mood.

[WAAAAAAAAARGH!](https://i.redd.it/kl3v771955m21.png)

Anyways, lookin’ at green wuzn’t enuff to tell if it wuz green so me boyz decided da best way of overcomin’ epistemic scepticizm wuz by usin’ da other senses ta ‘ave more sense data rezultz. So we’z caught dat Morky git again and put ‘im by da bones, but dis time we tested not jus’ look but touch an’ sniff an’ taste an’ listen. Da touch test wuz a real breakfroo: da bonez were not movey at all but da git wuz very movey, wrigglin’ like a zoggin’ squig (so we’z ‘it ‘im wiv clubs a few times ta get betta resultz). We all funk dat the wrigglin’ green was very different to da bones which were still an not-wriggly, so dis was a point against da ‘bones are green’ feory. Da next few sense trialz wuz less conclusive: da bone an’ da git both smelled an’ tasted same, but maybe dat was coz da git wuz leakin' all over da bones. Da last test was wiv sound, so he listened ta da ‘squish’ da git made when we’z krumped ‘im, den listened ta da ‘crunch’ of da bones when we’z krumped dem. Krumpin’ da bones gave us a zoggin’ good WAAAAAAARGH, but afta we finished wiv all dat we concluded dat da sound was different.

So me and me gitz went tell da Wurrgog Prophet wot we found: dat dere was contradiction between green bein’ da best, WAAAAAAAAARGH being green and bones giving us WAAAAAARGH but not bein’ green. Da Wurrgog bonked us a few timez (but less dan usual so we’z knew we ‘ad a good fink going’). Da Wurrgog wanted ta test out some other fings, we ‘ad to gets anuvver set of big bonez. We’z did so and me gits finked dat it would be anuvver long day of krumpin’ testz, so we wuz excited. But da prophet didn’t wantz to do no krumpin’ test. He jus’ points to da bone an’ asks question: “is da bone da best?”. We’z all say yeah, coz it give uz a good WAAAAAAARGH and WAAAAAAAAAARGH iz da best. “Is green da best?”. We’z all knew da answa to dat one: “WAAAAAAARGH!”. He asked den: “iz grass green?”. Me gits nodded but me wuz startin’ ta see where dis wuz goin’. Den he ask “is grass da best?”. Me and me gits sed no, grass is jus’ grass. It ain’t az good as da boyz or a WAAAAAARGH. Den he sed somefing me never forget: “den if grass izn’t da best, ‘ow can it be green?”

Dis stumped me gits, so I’z decided ta put da conkluzion togevver. I sed “so you’z saying it dun’t matter whevver a fing lookz, smellz, of moves green: if it da best den it green, coz green iz da best. If it a zoggin’ weak fing den it ain’t green even if it movez or lookz like a git”. Da prophet nodded, and me felt well finkey fer comin’ up wiv dat feory on da spot. A Gorky git den ‘it me in the ‘ead, I fink to dislodge some of dat finkiness cuz he wuz jealous. So we’z all break da bonez an’ ‘ad a good WAAAAAAAAAAARGH. Dose bonez, as we found out in dis series of trials, are GREEN cuz they da best and da best cuz dey green.

WAAAAAAAAARGH!

IF ITS A STRAY CAT, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO IT. It happened a few years ago so i may not remember everything and also sorry if poor formatting im on mobile.

ME: me ofc
EN: Entitled Neighbour
ES: Entitled Son
M:Mom


So to the main story, one day we moved houses and and we had to leave our cats at the old house since we didnt have space for them. We went to feed and take care of them twice a day and our shitty neighbour used to take our cat's food for no reason because she didnt have a damn cat! And the day we came to take them to our new house the neighbour came out here, and this is what she said.


EN: (yelling) WHAT ARE YOU DOING.

M: Oh we are just taking our cats to our house.

EN: (yelling again) DONT YOU DARE TOUCH THOSE CATS.

In comes the ES.

 ES: What are you all yelling about? you are disturbing my sleep!

-me starting to put our cats into their cages to take them with us-

EN:(to me ) YOU FUCKING BITCH, DONT YOU DARE TAKE THOSE DANMED CATS.

M: (also yelling) YOU DONT GET TO TALK TO MY DAUGHTER LIKE THAT, BITCH.

EN: THESE CATS ARE STRAY CATS SO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE THEM SO THEY ARE NOW MINE.

M: THEY OUR CATS AND HAVE BEEN OURS SINCE FUCKING 3 YEARS AGO

(Trying to talk but my mom doesnt listen.  ES: My mom is right! Just let her have the fucking cat for fuck sake!

EN: IF THEY ARE YOUR CATS THEN WHY ARE THEY STRAY (umm logic wot)

Then we just ignored her and started to go to our car and our cats.

They were really awesome cats and i loved them and sadly they died a few months ago so im still kinda sad.

22 [M4F] UK/Online - Looking for someone to mess around with so that I can stop going to the r/bigdickproblems subreddit. Soo heey, how's it going? how's life treating you? Good...good... Not sure why I'm suddenly having a stage fright... anyway nice to meet you all!

&amp;#x200B;

I would have a made PowerPoint for you to enjoy, but I really don't feel like trying that hard ahah! Even though this post might come off as me trying too hard... Still here's my backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

Name's... let's say "Teru", 22, born in Italy, but currently crawling towards an MSc in Software engineering in the England (U wot mate?!), also working part-time as a software developer (even though I still feel like a crappy dev).

&amp;#x200B;

Here 'cause Tinder/Bumble/OKC have been pretty rough, and I'm scared to approach ladies in the library's not quiet area... I mean it's still a library! I should go out more...

&amp;#x200B;

**Anyway more about me:**

*  I like anime and manga (can still hear the laughs).
* Very casual when it comes to video games since my low tier laptop can't handle much...(needs more coal)
* I spend a lot of time on youtube.
* I used to somewhat like cooking but having a McDonald's and a Subway under the student halls, changed that.
*  I "don't dislike" hiking, even if rarely do it and only in when in Italy.
* Slim 5'11" manlet (180 cm, for all the fellow europeans out there), average-male-height gang represent!
* INFP is the personality and worrying is the quality.

&amp;#x200B;

**More and more about me:**

Other than studying and working, (and my dissertation), there isn't much going on...oh! I started doing push-ups (all the way to the ground) before going to bed, started with like 10 and now I can do 20 without sweating.

&amp;#x200B;

Would like to have an IT company one day but I'm not enough business oriented, took an entrepreneurship module last year and ngl...stuff's kinda boring.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I'm looking for?**

Honestly, I'm just looking for someone to stop me from thinking that buying a £ 50 web domain on a friday night whilst semi-inebriated, is a good idea... even though those new .dev domains are really tempting.

&amp;#x200B;

More honestly, I have no idea, maybe someone with whom I can be more like the guy in this post and less like the non-chad me irl (ahah chad)... someone willingly to JoJo pose with me (sailor moon poses are also cool tho)... You know what? I just want to play with your Nintendo switch lady.

&amp;#x200B;

okok I got this, I think I want someone... like a friend, that is also female, close enough to actually meet? maybe?

&amp;#x200B;

Guess I'll go hiding under a rock, now that I've dishonored the family name in front of a group of strangers online.

&amp;#x200B;

PM if you feel me! (or don't, no pressure)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank for giving me your time!

Have a nice one!

Bye

&amp;#x200B;

P.S:  Also no lizard people! I know you there!... Who am I kidding, please come back! I need any bit of attention I can get!

&amp;#x200B;

P.P.S: Also hope it wasn't too cringe... I mean come on! there's a lot more cringe stuff than this, right?

&amp;#x200B;

P.P.P.S: Sorry for the formatting, it's like my 2 reddit post ever.

No power pulling hill with light load.. I've tried to rule out everything I could think of before posting.

&amp;#x200B;

2002 GMC 2500 LB7 2wd

&amp;#x200B;

Truck has 287k, motor has 174k. Motor was a used longblock from a junkyard.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue, is that when I have any kind of trailer on the truck , even unloaded trailer, I have no power when going uphill. I can press the pedal in all the way...sometimes it shifts, sometimes not. But either way I don't gain much speed. I'm lucky to keep the 55 or 60 mph. It almost feels like its making no boost, but I can hear the turbo spool up good, and I can see boost on my MAP sensor(anytime it goes higher than 29.5-30 Hg)

&amp;#x200B;

Unloaded, no trailer, I feel like it makes decent power going uphill. Adding a 16ft unloaded trailer causes me not to be able to pass someone. Truck feels like it makes good power at low speed.

&amp;#x200B;

Truck is stock.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've done so far:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Did an injector cleaning with the blue stuff from the bottle.

\-New Primer/Fuel filter housing and filter(I tried rebuilding the old one, but in the end didn't trust it)

\-New spin on secondary filter at fuel tank. I have a remote fuel filter at the tank. Has 1/2" line and fittings

\-Cleaned MAF Sensor

\-Checked FRP at Idle(5000/35) and WOT(23000/160)

\-Have a Carter 4600HP lift pump, tried with it and also tried it bypassed, makes 0 difference.

\-Hard unloaded uphill pull I'm seeing almost 25-26 psi of boost(looked with 2 different scanners), sometimes a little better. Truck has the ppe valve on it.

\-Scanner shows throttle pedal can go from 0-99%

\-2 injectors(1 &amp; 6) have balance rates of 2.5 or close to it at a warm idle. It likely could use a set of injectors, I haven't done any type of return test on it. I am saving to buy a set and do it right...Just cause I don't know the motor history. Unsure if this would cause the power loss I'm describing.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like its the pedal/sensor or some kind of fuel issue I can't find.

&amp;#x200B;

4 stroke dirt bike with new carb only runs choked Hey folks! I've been messing with a 1985 Yamaha xt/yt? 225 4 stroke and I've run into a snag.
Couldn't get the old carb setup(jets,parts and gaskets not available) so bought a clone mikuni.
It seems as though I cannot get the jetting or tune right. With the stock jets (98main with needle in middle and 38 pilot 2.5 out on mix screw) it seems to run mean with a whole lot of popping on decel and the bike won't rev out.
I went up to 100 and 40 pilot and it makes the same issues but now the plug is black and it does under WOT.
During the whole procedure it will not run unless half choked. Full choke it bogs at the top end, but half it will start first or second kick and will rev to the moon. I should mention that when introducing starting fluid it dies. Everything points to too rich.
I'm unsure where to go from here. Getting stock jets back in and resetting carb to factory. Will be checking spark plug after every time and fire.

Is there a plug warming procedure I should be doing? Could timing be out? Valve set?
 Plz help. This awesome little bike is driving me up the wall

Snooping around found some weird mails, should i bury the relationship? Me:30M She:28F First of all thanks in advance for reading, and im sorry about my english and for the WoT. Secondly let me describe the situation. Started going out with a girl in Feb 2018, the first time i fall in love at first sigh after being single for 3 years, and in a relationship for 8 years, so my first time dating as an adult you can say. From day one, she was overly honest, to the point where she said he had feeling still for a former ex(now friend, lets call him "B"), and that she cannot go in a relationship without sorting that out. So  we tried , and eventually broke out, and 2 months later she would text me to see each other again.This second time was overall better, a lot of commiment on her behalf, at this point she said she would stop seeing her friend, because it wasnt healthy for any of them and that she really wanted to invest in the relationship. Last january she asked me to be his BF, to move together in the next months, introduced me to her family(via skype, she is from Vzla). Middle Feb, she started having panic attacks, due to the blackout in Venezuela(has lots of family there still) and Work issues. In the short run, stopped going to work, and started looking for a new one. At this time, she was really depressed, her appartment was always a mess and she barely did anything besides staying in bed. She told me the previous relationship(8 year living together) found her at a similar spot where she would be 10 months without working and that she didnt want to be like that again, she wanted to get out of the problem by her own means. So middleweek she get a msg from "B" when we were watching netflix on her phone, and a week later we broke up, even tho i offered her to move, to help her economically and past this stuff together, as a couple. This time, she said i did everything right, and that it wasnt my faul, that i was perfect for her but she didnt have the means/time, to deal with relationship/move/work/family, so that she wants to be the better version of herself to be with me, but at the time she didnt want me to hang on that posibility, so we should each carry on and in the future see what happen(this is a week ago). So in my case, i like to sort out the problem with my couple, to learn from each other and help us being the best version of ourselves, so this struck me bad, like you are leaving me when i could help you the most. So yesterday i couldnt help myself, and i went snooping, she left gmail and facebook on my computer so i checked both. From facebook i read a conv were "B" asked to go on a jazz night, and she ask if she can wear a nice dress(date of this msg was a week before we broke up). On gmail, she was asking places to go on a weekend with her couple, and the fwd the mails to "B". Also read about her declining a place because they had been looking for appartments and would be moving then(end of march). She also has a list pinned "New home", with stuff like "buy chairs, buy a bed,etc". In the last few days, she texted me asking how was i doing, showing stuff she was doing work related. So in the last msg i asked "It was "B" all along right?", she told me that she went to eat dinner with him yesterday, and if that was bad.

I have to see her in the next few days and dont know how to approach this, cause im not proud of the snooping.

Let my son take your ps3 he has good grades!!! this happened a few years ago (and btw ik dutch so, sorry for all the typo’s)
Ek - entitled kid (accually my nephew but its a kid)
Em - entitled mom (accually my aunt but its a mom)
Me - the derp master (u wot m8)

Little background: i work hard for my money and they know that and how much i earn (its 30 euro’s a week for the ones who interests it) and i bought a ps3 with it because i was eorking hard for it (the ps3 was really new on that time)
This was the following talk

Em: hi how are you?

Me: hi i’m good, how are you?

Em: oh im fine but my son just got a really good grade for math but i dont have the money to buy or give something for him.

Me: oh thats dissapointing maybe just wait until you have your salary or ask if he can give you’re salary a little faster.

Em: no that can’t i already asked for that but i heard you just bought the new playstation.

Me: ye why?

Em: *begins to call Ek to come over to me*

(I didnt live much streets apart from them)

Me: why are you calling Ek?

Em: oh its just so he can take your playstation you can probably afford another one.

Me: no i cant and he cant take my ps3

*Ek comes in*

Ek: hi [my name] i heard i could take you’re new ps3 that you wanted to give me for my good grade!!

Me: hi i’m sorry to say this but you cant take my new ps3 your mom lied to you.

*starts to cry* (he was 11 at the time and i was 15)

Me: why you crying?

Em: YOU MADE MY LITTLE BABY CRY YOU NEED TO SHAME YOURSELF!

Me: why tho, i did nothin wrong.

Ek: *still crying*

My mom heard the whole conversation but kept listening until the Em walks to her and lie.

Em: IM GOIN TO TELL YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS AND SHE WILL NOT LIKE IT IF I TELL HER YOU HIT EK!!!!!!!

Im getting a little mad at the time so i screamed the following words.

Me: YOU STFU ITS MY PS4 AND IF U TELL MY MOM ABOUT IT THAN I DONT CARE!

Em walks to my mom and lied about the whole coversation but than my mom said

Mom: i heard the whole conversation and my son doesnt need to shame for THAT!

Em getting a little white

Me trying to not laugh

Em: Ek lets go they are just downies anyways!

Me getting actually mad (and i think i did my best cuz i have anger isseus) so when she walked past me i gave her the biggest bitchclap ive ever did and i was proud of it.

Em: WTF DID YOU JUST DO (now my mom is not trying to laugh)

Me: i slapped you ma’am and i’m proud of it!

Ek: you hurt my mom! Now i can slap you back!!

Me: no why your mom was in the wrong way

Em: are you harrasing my child again!?!?!?

Me: no could you guys just leave you can see im getting really mad.

Em: no you are hurting me and Ek

Me: you know ik can just call the cops on you

Em and Ek straight left whitout saying a word

Funniest day of my life (im 26 now and i still think about that day and laugh every time i think about it)

I’m 15M and I’m extremely unhappy with my penis I’m like 5’6 120lbs, decent body, but my dick is like 4.75 inches erect, and has a big upward curve. It’s not even that it’s curved that much (like a “U”) , it just starts facing upward + the amount of curve it has causes it to literally be parallel with my stomach (pointing towards the sky). If I apply pressure it can do down a little, bit too much hurts. I worry girls wot like it as it may make certain positions harder to accomplish as well as head. I hate my dick, yo.

**You:** I found this navy girl here on Omegle

**You:** oh wait not navy girl

**You:** criminologist student

**Stranger:** .\_

**Stranger:** XD

**You:** we roleplayed here first

**You:** then we connected on kik

**You:** and roleplayed two or three times

**You:** they were fantasies about doing it in the room, in an empty classroom

**You:** in the beach

**You:** things like tat

**You:** that

**You:** and after sexting like this, she asked for a pic

**You:** and I'm like "a dick pic?"

**You:** she said yes

**You:** and then she said "here these are my boobs"

**You:** and sent me her boobs

**You:** which were big by the way

**You:** did you get asleep as well?

**Stranger:** No

**Stranger:** Wtf

**Stranger:** No

**You:** oh ok

**Stranger:** I searchin Somethin while u wrote

**Stranger:** Was

**You:** oh right

**You:** ok

**Stranger:** Continue plz

**You:** well we switched to trading pics after that

**You:** and my favorite pic from her was actually one she sent me when she was out on the snow

**You:** she took it from inside the car

**You:** because the girl was hot in her fantasies, but not too hot in appearance

**You:** not my favorite

**Stranger:** :T

**You:** But I would have kept going if not for the regret, but I never said good bye to her

**You:** I just deleted the kik app

**Stranger:** I see youre a man of culture

**Stranger:** XD

**You:** hehe

**You:** that meme is really funny. Too bad it dies

**You:** died

**You:** After that I met the blonde ninpho girl

**You:** It was funny how I started sexting with her

**You:** I asked if she had ever done it in a party, and she said yes

**You:** that she did it with her exboyfriend, and that he was an asshole

**You:** she said she was driving as well, and I asked if she had done it in a car

**You:** she said that surprisingly no

**You:** she had done it while her boyfriend was playing fornite

**Stranger:** .\_.

**Stranger:** Is she a pornhub actress? XD

**You:** I was perplexed

**You:** So I asked if she wanted to talk about breaking up with the asshole of her boyfriend

**You:** she asked if I had ever cheated on someone

**You:** I said no and it was the truth

**You:** she said that that was good, because her boyfriend cheated on her in that same party

**Stranger:** WOS

**Stranger:** WOAH

**Stranger:** WTF

**You:** my same reaction

**You:** so after asking if she wanted to sext or talk about something else

**You:** well she started sexting

**Stranger:** LoL

**Stranger:** With F i Will say

**Stranger:** WADDABITCH

**You:** she sent this video of her masturbating in the car with a vibrator and moaning

**You:** and it was easily the hottest thing a human being had sent me

**Stranger:** Not Even my sperm girl got that far

**You:** by the way, the music on the radio that she was playing was pretty nice as well

**You:** gave good ambience

**Stranger:** XD

**Stranger:** Porn actress.

**Stranger:** XD

**You:** well, the last girl was indian girl

**You:** she was my favorite girl

**You:** and by favorite I really mean it

**You:** we had this connection...

**You:** we liked the same fantasies

**You:** she liked what I looked like

**You:** I liked her as well

**You:** she was the only girl I sent a pic of my lips to

**Stranger:** Oof

**You:** actually it was a video of myself biting my lips

**You:** and she said she liked it

**You:** she did it first, so I replied with that

**You:** and she was really hot when she did it as well

**You:** and her boobs were good. Her body was pretty

**You:** and she sent me vids of her masturbating as well

**You:** she was pretty intense, but trading nudes was not her focus

**You:** mostly she wanted to roleplay, and she sent me nudes because she asked to see me

**You:** but when she did, it was dark in her room, and she had a partner in her dorm room

**You:** so she couldn't send me pics back

**You:** so I kept asking for pics, but she kept giving reasons, so I just said ok and kept roleplaying with her

**You:** and I really liked it, and liked it more when she finally sent me vids of her

**You:** she was showering when she did

**You:** she came up with scenarios of us having sex in an elevator, at work

**Stranger:** Oof

**Stranger:** This squirts

**Stranger:** :/

**Stranger:** Have u ever done roleplay threesome?

**Stranger:** XD

**You:** well....

**You:** I actually did that once...

**You:** with a guy

**You:** though Im not gay

**Stranger:** :C

**Stranger:** Tf

**You:** do you want me to finish telling you the story of the indian girl and then tell you the roleplay threesome?

**You:** oh wait, by roleplay threesome, do you mean roleplaying with three people, or about three people?

**Stranger:** With three people

**You:** oh ok then no

**You:** that would be kinda messy I think

**You:** just like real life threesomes XD

**You:** well, when it comes to the indian girl, I stopped chatting with her because...

**You:** well basically, I was really into her

**You:** but like I really liked her and she said the same

**You:** we loved each other

**You:** and I was cleaning my friends list in snapchat from friends I didn't chat with

**You:** and I deleted her

**You:** by accident

**You:** oops

**You:** no

**You:** and I didn't know her username. I didn't memorize it

**Stranger:** Rip

**You:** yep

**You:** I hoped she would chat me and then I could add her back

**You:** but she never did

**You:** and at the same time, I regretted it all the same, as I did with the other girls

**You:** it's always the same vicious cycle for the past three weeks or so

**Stranger:** \_.

**Stranger:** So u can't stop?

**You:** I feel like I needed to tell someone

**You:** And I was kind of hoping I could do that here

**You:** And I just did

**Stranger:** :T

**Stranger:** What do you expect of me?

**Stranger:** A psicologist?

**Stranger:** XD

**You:** not really

**You:** nothing really

**You:** I just wanted to tell someone

**Stranger:** I can only tell u tips

**You:** tips like what?

**Stranger:** Try not getting too much into it.

**You:** oh right

**You:** the thing is, this might sound ridiculous

**You:** I kind of want to fall in love the old fashioned way

**You:** meet a girl and date her

**You:** marry her and live together

**You:** not like I want to find her here

**Stranger:** Told u to go find chicks

**Stranger:** Maybe Just talk to em

**You:** it's not like I lack the confidence exactly

**You:** I don't really know how to put it

**You:** the point is, I started sexting not because I wanted to in the beginning but because I was lucky in TWS and wanted to try it again

**You:** and I got lucky again and again and again

**Stranger:** &lt;-&lt;

**Stranger:** Start by telling em ur a odder

**Stranger:** Get a cool ass outfit

**You:** spiderman outfit

**Stranger:** Get Ur best chick blowers

**Stranger:** Lol yes xD

**Stranger:** And instead of talkin em

**Stranger:** Listen go em

**Stranger:** To\*

**You:** oh ok I do know how to talk to girls don't worry

**Stranger:** Like i listen to yogurt girl apologizing for giving me sour yogurt

**You:** yoghurt girl is best girl

**Stranger:** XD

**You:** say hi from my part when she wakes up

**Stranger:** I'll tell her the weird perv from yesterday says hi

**Stranger:** Lol

**You:** right

**You:** well, the point is that this feeling of wanting to fall in love is what drives me off of here and makes me stop

**You:** Only to come back to find new girls

**You:** and that has kept going on for the past three weeks

**You:** until this guy and his sidekick sperm girl showed up

**You:** and I asked for age and they were like .i.

**You:** and I was like "well that's new"

**Stranger:** LOL

**Stranger:** XDDDDDDDDDD

**Stranger:** IM GONNA FUCKING DIE LAUGHTING

**Stranger:** Almost woke her up xD

**You:** like the only reason I stayed was because, well, I've had weird reactions before

**You:** but they are that. Reactions

**You:** people usually disconnect if they don't like something

**You:** and it was funny as well

**Stranger:** XD

**Stranger:** So

**Stranger:** Wanna hear how i met yogurt gurl?

**Stranger has disconnected.**

One off with my small community of DnDers &gt; Tl:Wr, Got together with group for one off because one guy couldn't make it.

&gt;[GameThymeYo.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/2ppFgNhbqahRS/giphy.gif)

&gt;[Starring.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/eIqJnroBG6gqA/giphy.gif): Tortle Monk, Hobbit Rogue, Goliath Barbarian, Bird-man ~~Monk~~ Life-Cleric.

&gt;[They_Didn't_plan_ahead_of_time.movie](https://media.giphy.com/media/jmcbABRp9EAHm/giphy.gif)

&gt;Players used to playing in typical forgotten realms world, except for one time jump into sci-fi land where they pissed off an undead dragon.

&gt;Players are now wandering around as foot soldiers on a desert planet filled to the brim with tieflings. (Humans settled over corpse/final battle ground against demon lord, infected slightly, proud of their heritage)

&gt;They get some cool walkie talkies.

&gt;Space ships.

&gt;Level 10 hardasses.

&gt;[BAMFs.vid](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2R09jc6eZIlfXKlW/giphy.gif)

&gt;Players wander around town, getting lay of the land, talk about marriage daggers around the necks of women, totally not stolen from r/WoT

&gt;Perimeter breach, alarm spell went off somewhere outside the city, and players are told to go check it out. Ride a train to nearby.

&gt;Suddenly a fight with about 3 wights and half a flaming skull. Half flaming skull came from previous session where main caste threw one eye gem through a portal to one place, and a second eye gem to another.

&gt;[ThisGameIsCanon.meme](https://media.giphy.com/media/PsBRTPKG71YVq/giphy.gif)

&gt;Players return to city to look for some way to permenently destroy flame skull because it's been the accidental BBEG for like 6 sessions so far in the main campaign.

&gt;Priest hands players a bottle of holy water.

&gt;[HeBoiledTheHellOutOfIt.cringyjoke](https://media.giphy.com/media/aoGzgM1Q0B8WY/giphy.gif)

&gt;Priest notices halflings small dagger. "You need to find a better man darling."

&gt;DM Didn't know she wrote a whole backstory for this one-off munchkin. Hobbit cries filthy hobbitses tears.... Priest leaves.

&gt;Return to boss, take up watchpost on tower on surrounding wall. Many other mercinaries of various races take up posts on other spots.

&gt;Players totally not expecting *any* encounters on first day of watch.

&gt;[Totally.jif](https://media.giphy.com/media/fGbbcXk14nqfe/giphy.gif)

&gt;Storms a comin.

&gt;Obviously the halfling looks over the wall that's taller than her, with the highest perception.

&gt;[TheresAFuckingUndeadArmy.ohfuck](https://media.giphy.com/media/nxeAo2Q8qNdrG/giphy.gif)

&gt;Hobbit also notices a bunch of flying shapes in the clouds. Dragons, wyvrens, little bit of everything. Looks fun.

&gt;Wyvrens attack our players tower, two of them. Rounds start, players look fucked.

&gt;[TheFuckingClericCastsBANISHMENTLikeHesHotShit.fuckme](https://media.giphy.com/media/cYDlCkEM3MksU/giphy.gif)

&gt;Players easily fight both Wyvrens individually. Only barbarian almost went down.

&gt;Get a bit healed up from flying bird-man-life-bringer. Players told to go get the giant shadowy dragon flying overhead. Dragon heading towards center of city/big ass church/burial ground of demon lord, for nefarious purposes that no one knows.

&gt;Young red shadow dragon is standing on church, I ask how they want to do this.

&gt;Tortle RUNS up the 30ft tall church and bites it on the leg. 17 to hit. Nada. Tortle looks up and hids in shell.

&gt;[TenageMutantNinjaTortleIsScared.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/kojJ5hf9DluM0/giphy.gif)

&gt;Shadow Dragon lets out huge ball of flame-esque darkness onto the unsuspecting players who didn't spread out for some reason.

&gt;[TotallyLegitPlanningStage.montage](https://media.giphy.com/media/fffvm6KhHkNwc/giphy.gif)

&gt;Fight goes on for a bit, bird-man saves day with a fuckload of healing spells. FINALLY CASTS AN OFFENSIVE RADIANT SPELL that deals real damage like a half hour of game time into this one battle.

&gt;Hobbit gets in her sneak attack, finally getting it bloodied/at half health.

&gt;Barbarian, after climbing to top of building only to watch it fly away and land at the bottom, leaps off and crushes his weapon into shadow dragon.

&gt;[CoolMovieReference.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/eobYwOL3jdtqo/giphy.gif)

&gt;Tortle pulls out a *FUCKING* immovable rod and turns it on just above the dragon, forcing it to stay on land next turn.

&gt;Blackened to a nice crispy crisp Bird man casts some sort of guardian spell that deals radiant damage and is concentration based.

&gt;Players manage to deal enough damage during this last round that nearly caused them to tpk, guardian's light pierces shadow dragon as it fades from existence.

&gt;[LastRoundWasBasicallyThis.movie](https://media.giphy.com/media/A3yPFiji9LAIM/giphy.gif)

&gt;In the main campaign, follower of The Raven Queen gets memo in magic notebook that their BBEG's lieutenant died in battle.

350z acting weird Hello all!

I have been having a hard time figuring out what could be happening to my Z

&amp;#x200B;

The car sputters and barely wants to go when I go around a little more than half throttle to WOT past around 3k RPM, I have replaced the MAF and the throttle body so far.  Here is the kicker, there is no CEL at all for anything besides the test pipes that are on the car that were on it when I bought the car back in October and this problem just started last week.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done a tune up of new NGK plugs and coils around 2 months ago so unless my coils are going bad at "higher RPM loads" I'm at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

At idle the car is perfect, when at a stop sign/red light and you begin to take off and light and I mean very light on the gas it's just fine. it will climb RPM all the way close to red line as I have tested it to see if it would (although very slowly due to giving it hardly any gas).

&amp;#x200B;

But once you go any "heavy" throttle is just bogs down and is like it's choking. I have taken the Z to the dealership and after 4 hours of paid diagnostics they suggested it's the throttle body hence why I replaced it and it's still acting up even after doing the idle relearn and everything else posted in forums on suggested fixes. My last option is a specialist Nissan/Z shop close to where I live and pay $125 an hour per hour of their time to see if their expertise with the VQ engine can help. But if I can avoid paying them for hours of labor, that would be ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be fantastic!

Dragon Ball Z/Super figure collectors....HALP How many of you go through a figure selection similar to me? Usually before I even buy one figure, I have to know there's a way to make all of the related figures I want fit together, and in the same scale. Well I've done a lot of research on DBZ figures...and it wasn't nearly enough.

&amp;#x200B;

My expectation coming into this hobby:

\- Want 1/12 figures? Collect SH Figuarts.

\- Want 1/10 figures? Collect Figure-Rise standard.

\- Want 1/8 figures? Collect figurerise MG and Megahouse (non-poseable but have fabric and you can turn the heads at least).

\- Want 1/6 figures? Collect Real Action Heroes.

\- Want kid's toys that won't break easily? Collect Dragon Stars

&amp;#x200B;

Reality is a little more like:

Want 1/10 figures? Collect, figure-rise Goku, wait, Android 18 is a little small...weird.....I guess I could get the non-articulated Megahouse version....wait, PICCOLO FIGURE RISE IS SHORTER THAN GOKU?! Ugh...Figuarts piccolo is around 5.5", and the figure rise Piccolo is around 6"...that's odd, The DRAGON STARS is the tallest? Ok....maybe I'll collect 1/12 instead, \*watches video of Dragon Stars Piccolo\* UGH THE STORES LIED ABOUT THE SIZE. Did Figure rise lie about their size too? \*watches video\* WTF. Okay about the same height as figure-rise Goku. I'm starting to get confused here. Just to be sure, how tall is Piccolo in the manga....7.5 FEET TALL? Dude, that's as big as my NECAs...so I need a 1/8 piccolo for 1/12 scale figuarts....Wot. Alright maybe a 1/8 piccolo?....8.5 inches tall....

&amp;#x200B;

And now this is me:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW3cAf1fj5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW3cAf1fj5U)

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion, since you guys collect DBZ/Super figures, how the heck, man? They're all out of scale with each other, and there's so many characters to match up. Thanks.

Dodged a bullet, my dudes. Ok, so I once dated this girl that was a senior in my old high school when I was in my first year of college (I’m now in my second year, turning 20 in a few months). It started getting more serious, but I had this odd feeling I couldn’t shake off, so I broke it off. Friends that knew her told me I did the right thing, didn’t know why they did say that. She was nice, friendly, but had some odd characteristics.

Mate, was I right on this one. Haven’t really heard of her since, she moved away to study, but she recently started messaging me on Snapchat. And holy fuck, the people she hangs out with. I’m really not one that is one of these anti-feminist types. But these people, are a living breathing stereotype of a tumblr feminist. You know these people from classics like “Hugh Mungus wot?”   I didn’t know these exist in real life. Man, I couldn’t cope with a real life filter bubble.

In conclusion, a gut feeling saved my ass.

EK claims my powerbank is his Obligatory “I’m on mobile” so excuse formatting, also english is my first language so tell me if I screw up lmao.
Cast:
Me: Mega Elephant
EK: Entitled Krazy Kid
F: Facilitator
So this was maybe a year ago, and where I live, we have a national track and field competition between schools every year, and for the entire day school is cancelled so we can go watch it. That day, I literally brought 7 powerbanks (no joke) so we would have power for the whole day (keep in mind this was just for my class, also this event lasts from morning till maybe 7pm or so).
So we’re about halfway into the event, and this dude behind me (EK) sees my backpack full of that j u i c y electricity. (We’re teens you can’t fault us).
And this dude comes up to me and he goes “yo can i borrow one of your powerbanks.”
At the time, most of my working ones were lent to my classmates, and the rest were all drained. So I tell him “Sorry dude, but all the ones I have are drained and plus you’re not even my classmate, so I can’t lend it to you.”
He gets all triggered and starts going “please please please let me borrow it please please” being all annoying, until I flip him the bird and go back to watching the competition.
Fast forward a couple minutes and EK returns along with F, and EK has a smug look on his face.
F: Why don’t you pass the powerbank to EK?
EK: Yeah y u bulli mi (we’re fuckin memelords in this school no judge)
Me: Wot I mean its not even charged and such and I’m not obligated to lend him a pwerbank
F, to EK: Wait wot I thought you said its your powerbank?
EK: YEAH HE’S JUST LYING GIVE ME BACK MY POWERBANK C**T
F: Why don’t you give him back his powerbank? It’s not yours
Me: Excuse me wtf this is clearly my powerbank look my name is on it
F: Ok what EK what is the meaning of this
Me: *face of confuse*
EK: uh u h u      h what
F, pissed: Ok EK what c’mere
So they walked away and I didn’t hear what happened later, did hear that he got a demerit point tho (our system of punishment). Few weeks later, he did try to harrass me and a very close friend, which later lead to that friend developing anxiety and such (story for another time) and my friend eventually left the school.
Yeah but this EK was just too darn stupid.
So that’s my first Entitled Kids post hope you enjoyed and also this entire conversation happened in very broken English and I’ve done my best to translate it into coherent speech, excuse me if anything is awkward.
Toodles~

MSI Twin Frozr III vertical lines problem I was playing WoT like two days ago and suddenly my monitor went full of some weird shit and got stuck like that. After restarting the computer I was greeted with that the photo shows, two vertical lines. Windows also didnt boot but thats another story, i already reinstalled it. I took my poor 7950 out and removed all dust from it (it was hella dusty), and right now im working on my iGPU. Ill put my Radeon in now and check if anything is better/worse and post it here.


Anyone experienced something simillar and can share some solutions? Is it a candidate for a trip to the oven?

Irelia E's VFX aren't immediately clear and it's really annoying. Both when I play as her and against her, there are countless times when I have to genuinely pause and wonder *Wait, what was that?*

Es that seemingly have absolutely no business landing, land.

Es that go directly through character models, don't.

****

**How it works:**

The animation/VFX starts [here](https://i.imgur.com/PNcVDz1.png) with a tiny line being drawn along the ground that's near completely invisible, from one blade to the other.

It then goes and shows [two bigger lines](https://i.imgur.com/uolRIoY.png) along the outskirts of what is the actual stun hitbox for a split flash, giving the enemy a chance to react.

From there the rectangle poofs away, 2 blades rush [at each other](https://i.imgur.com/hWLEw5c.png) and stun whatever intersects.

****

The two outer lines are the hitbox proper.

The bitch of this is that you have to aim both lines at the opposing character model's feet above all else, as that is where their hitbox actually is. If you look at Darius' head and throw an E slightly lower, it won't stun.

Both lines will bisect his character model, but the game's (X, Y) won't read it as a hit.

[If you don't see what I'm talking about.](https://i.imgur.com/B462Kzd.png) (Here this one would land since the hitbox is just barely touching Darius')

This is **annoying as hell.**

Lux Q, Morg Q, Blitz Q, Thresh Q, don't have this problem thanks to the lollipop effect at the end of them (where they bloat out slightly towards the tip of the hitbox). This is why shit like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6F1ZuwDdp8) happens sometimes.

Irelia E does not have this since the hitbox is a perfect rectangle.

I just tested this on a dummy, track the circle around the model base and you can make a perfect hexagon around the base of the model. The two stun lines will bisect the upper 1/3rd of the model's hat, but it will not stun.

This gets especially fucky when characters suddenly start flying, dashing, digging holes in the ground, and leads to general case-by-case inconsistency.

****

**Wot I think:**

Obviously you can't change the game's bloody camera angle thanks to 1 champion, nor is Riot going to go out of their way to fix something that isn't *horribly* broken. Irelia E works fine if you understand how hitboxes in the game really work vs. how they seemingly work.

Nor is Riot going to add Lollipopping to this hitbox since it'd make things even more confusing.

What could help, however, is keeping the two outer lines in place towards the end of the animation. The near-invisible line at the beginning of the animation becomes that bold line at the end of it when both blades zip through towards one another.

Can we keep the two outer lines towards the end of the animation since those are the ones that actually matter? You see the hitbox for a flash and then it poofs away, which for a static AoE stun like this one doesn't really fly in my opinion.

Just a thought. The emboldened middle line where both blades zip at each other is just there to look cool, it'd be nice if we could keep the rectangle through to the end of the animation (maybe just make the lines fade away as the middle zips through?)

There's no real fixing the issue without breaking the game or giving her a new E, but keeping the visible hitbox aound for just a bit longer in the animation might help lessen the *How the shit did that land/not land?* moments.

Turbo flutter at WOT? I recently installed a k&amp;n high flow filter with no airbox lid, all criticisms about heat from engine bay and all that aside, I can hear the turbo alot more when it spools. One thing I've noticed however is at wot the turbo surges quite a bit. I was in 4th going 70km/h and floored it to 100km/h and I heard quite a bit of flutter on the way there. The gauge didn't jump around at all though, went up to the proper level and stayed there. I have nothing done other than the k&amp;n filter.

 Anyone else experience this at all? I read that it can be a result of TC being on but I haven't tried it without TC on yet.

1st to 2nd gearshift Had my 18 fost for a year now, it was my first manual car.

Question, is ther anything to fix the 1st to 2nd gear shift since sometimes at wot it feels like it doesnt want to go into 2nd, so embarrassing thinking im in 2nd and it goes into neutral and im rev bombing people.

It feels like 2nd has 2 gates and the first click make me think im in gear when im not sometimes.

Usually worse when someone else is in the car and im distracted and miss 2nd(also seems stiff as hell when cold outside).

I have 0 problems with every other gear and can even heel toe and passengers think there in a auto transmission its so smooth.

Bernie Sanders is a Russian plant I had a friend come over the other day, he's never had a lot of money and works a 9-5, explain to me why he is apolitcal. I mean I understood the sentiment, that every politician is going to screw you, but it turned into a wild ass conspiracy very quick.

&amp;#x200B;

I started probing about Bernie, and he said almost word for word, in complete sincerity "Yeaahhh man... idk sadly Bernie Sanders is a socialist sent here from Russia to destroy the country". Like wot dude. There is absolutely no evidence of that. College education needs to be free asap comrades.

Wot Call me sensitive, but because of her reply to my text, I've pretty much lost hope lol.

To give some context, I wished her happy birthday via text, so she replies saying thank you, then continues on saying that though we don't talk much irl, I'm "beyond sweet and super pretty." So I'm just like ???

Then I replied saying that that's what I should be saying to HER and she replies with a "thank you again!"

Idk but I feel like she's just trying to get me off her back and that hurts a lot, considering I don't even talk to her much, both irl and online, for fear of coming across as desperate. Or maybe I'm just too freaked out, bc her reply was so out of context. Ahh, my heart can't handle this much man

Continued... should I buy this specific FD Following up from the previous post I made: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RX7/comments/b20smf/considering\_an\_fd\_thats\_rarely\_been\_driven\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RX7/comments/b20smf/considering_an_fd_thats_rarely_been_driven_the/)

TLDR: Looking at buying an FD with 80k on stock motor and a slew of tasteful/necessary upgrades to common maintenance items. The tricky part, they were all installed 3,000 miles ago, but those 3,000 miles have taken place over 15 years. Supposedly he would start it up and drive it once a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Aaaand go: Went to see the car again today to get a longer test drive to confirm that I'm actually interested. Goal was that if I liked it after the test drive, I'd take it to a local rotary mechanic and get a compression test and basic inspection.

Pros:

* Idles steady at 700rpm
* Sits around 210\* at idle in traffic which drops down to about \~180 when cruising on the freeway at 70mph (this sounds normal right?)
* Broke traction at the top of 2nd gear at WOT, so it's certainly got some power (and old tires)!
* Thought the sunroof had issues, but spoke to the owner and tested it and it actually works great!
* Interior is by far the best I've seen- black
* Stock paint is in very good condition and obviously garaged
* Very smooth ride (minus NVH from poly motor mounts and suspension bushings) and handles bumps/pot holes surprisingly well
* Relatively few rattles in the interior considering it's age

Cons:

* Coolant likely hasn't been changed or flushed in at least 15 years (potential lingering catastrophic issue?)
* Still has that weird sound at low speed, seemingly from the drivers side, right at throttle tip in. originally described it as a grind, but now I'd categorize it more as a hum. Any thoughts what this could be?
* Glove box is broken (which as I understand is EXTREMELY common)
* Paint on drivers fender has a \~3"x0.5" chip right at the lip due to needing the fenders rolled
* Small rock chips which have been poorly addressed with large globs of touch up paint (pretty sure I can fix)
* Paint on side mirrors has lost its clear coat/shine (also pretty sure I can fix)
* Definite increase in NVH due to poly motor mounts, which causes a vibration through the aftermarket short shifter and an annoying rattle at freeway speed
* 5th gear acceleration from low rpms (\~2k) seems a bit... labored?

&amp;#x200B;

So I've indicated interest in taking it to the mechanic for the compression/inspection and will make the final decision based upon those results. Curious if anyone has any input or thoughts given the new info. What would you pay for this vehicle (I know you have very little to go on, but I would categorize the car as "very good" were I looking it up on KBB)

DARN YOU HAYMITCH &amp;#x200B;

 (Firstly, This was my first ever time playing DnD, and also DM-ing it. So I made a totally homebrewed game that I just used dice in XD. )

&amp;#x200B;

 OOOK.  Heres the cast:

Crystal: My Dragonborn NPC that I played in game whilst dm-ing. used to get the players back from derailing the campaign. they lost their memory in an attack from a rare type of carnivorous plants and retired from adventuring soon after, wanting to live with her family (Too bad crystal, you are not getting that)

&amp;#x200B;

Haymitch: A Dragonborn rouge who hated my guts. the character was a drunk, and my good old buddy couldn't figure out a name so I slyly referenced hunger games and HAYMITCH THE DRUNK DRAGON was born.

&amp;#x200B;

Druid/ Old forest goblin: A druid who never told us her name in the game. she hated everyone except trees. she loved trees. "DONT TOUCH MY TREEEEEEEEEEE"

&amp;#x200B;

Scared: A Homebrewed species called "Endo." They have oddly large jaws, are short, and have dark black scale-leather-skin stuff. 12 years old. Their name is their personality, honestly. ,., "WHY MUST IT RAINNNN. thunder is scary ,3,

&amp;#x200B;

Clarisse: A sweet, squeaky voice, normal human. she secretly is insane and ended up working for the villain. has an assent. a very western accent with a high pitch ear bleeding voice.....my ears are still damaged ,.,

&amp;#x200B;

FLAMIN BALL OF FIRE\~ (also called blitz): A Psychic that watches the world burn 24/7. trusts their friend enough not to use his powers on them.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr.Asmodues: The villain. mind controls anyone who dares show their face. "Look into my eyes, and I will show you eternityyyyy...." (Get the reference and I am happy.)

&amp;#x200B;

Chickenhound: One of the evil villain's minions. was a pilot. (also a reference from the same place)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK STORYTIME FOR FIRST DND GAME ONESHOT

&amp;#x200B;

The party was flying on an expensive plane, chatting with each other. Haymitch and Druid were having a drinking contest, Clarisse was 'innocently' watching as blitz made a dragon flying about with some FiRe\~. Crystal was talking to her little sister, Gemstone, on the phone. Scared was texting his older brother, Evil, silent in the back. telling himself everything was fine, and such. The Pilot came over the intercom and said the following. "We are experiencing turbulence, please stay calm."

&amp;#x200B;

Clarrise shouted over her shoulder. "Gotttt it Chik-ayn Ound!" Then, we went into a dive, speeding. Everyone freaked out, and only one person rolled high enough to not blackout. The pilot, Chicken Hound.

&amp;#x200B;

My character was the first to wake up and found themselves laying upside down on a tree limb. Chicken hound was nowhere to be seen. My character climbed down the tree, luckily sustaining nothing but a slightly sprained ankle. "Guys-are you ok!"

&amp;#x200B;

She noticed a flare signal burst out of the water, a thumbs up, and a 'need first aid' sign. soon, a FLAMIN BALL OF FIRE emerged from the water, holding scared, who was out-cold with a broken leg and a large shard of glass stabbed inches from his heart. (he rolled a one on his first roll. Rip. ,.,)

&amp;#x200B;

Crystal, panicked, looked around whilst  The old forest goblin ran from the broken hull of the plane, holding the first aid hit, Clarisse behind her. while we were reviving Scared, Haymitch came out of this woods, one of hears ears ripped off.

&amp;#x200B;

after we bandaged all the wounds and such, we started looking for chicken hound then we heard something from the jungle. "Assssmooodeeus...? \*chuckle\* Look into my eyessss.....I shalll give you eternittyy...." There was a loud snap, a scream, then silence.

&amp;#x200B;

Scared started crying and shaking, with Crystal trying to comfort him, looking at the jungle with a lost look in her eye. a look of remembering, and sadness. Haymitch was still drunk, and it took both blitz and the old forest goblin to hold him back. Clarisse, on the other hand, screamed ut. "Char-ga! Weh must trayy and sav Chik-ayn OUND!"

&amp;#x200B;

So we regrouped, and all followed Clarisse through the jungle, leaving an s.o.s sign with sticks in the sand. we mainly were looking for food, but Clarisse insisted we at least look for the body. a bit of hunting later, Crystal froze. I made everyone else roll to see if they saw what she saw.   Haymitch, Blitz, scared, and druid fell into a large pitcher-plant like a carnivorous plant. when they landed in it, they hardly had time to move before they were out cold. That left Crystal with Clarrise. Crystal was petrified with fear, as a similar plant, designed to poison and confuse their victims, had made her lose her memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarisse brushed this off, and grabbed a vine, slowly climbing in and pulling them in without taking in a breath. this took multiple dice rolls and she had to go in and out. to get them out. then, Clarisse OOC whispered something to me. My smile widened as I derailed my own campaign, rewriting it in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Crystal heard a rustle in the bushes and turned slightly. A small snake slithered out of the brush. Crystal had lost her memory, if you remember, and had no knowledge it was a KING COBRA :D. she petted it innocently, until it reared back, and BIT HER. she stared at the bite as I rolled. 1. SHe crumpled to the floor, screaming in agony as she withered with pain then she stopped. the snake slithered forward and wrapped around her head. Druid and Haymitch were our of the plant by now, and they rolled to see if they woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

they both woke up and saw Crystal as she screamed, then slowly got up. Crystal carried a large rapier with her. always. HEr bright blue eyes were swirling with a sickly green color. she grabbed her rapier and swung at Haymitch. Scared was out now, but wasn't up.

&amp;#x200B;

Crystal hit Haymitch in the arm, which was almost cut off. he, hating me even more, grabbed Clarisse's sword. he stole it and slashed at the snake wrapped around crystals neck. 1. (this dice is CURSED) He fumbled, and one of her horns was sliced. clean. off. She screamed in agony, as druid tried to knock the snake off. she rolled a 5. the snake bit her, and she was withering on the ground in pain.

&amp;#x200B;

a few turns later, everyone woke up chained to a wall. except for Clarisse. Crystal was also in sight, but not on the wall. she had a large mask on her face, and was standing next to...chiken hound? they were both silent, guarding the cell. the masks seemed fused to their face in an odd way...

&amp;#x200B;

Scared looked at crystal and broke into tears. "I WANNA GO HOME! I WANNA SEE MY BROTHER!" I quickly rolled the dice for how badly my character would react. my character rolled 20 and ended up beating scared till he shut up with a long spear. Haymitch started cursing at me and also got beat. Druid seemed dead inside, and blitz was out of it, rocking back and forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, a long cloaked figure walked over. it hissed something, and crystal walked in, grabbing Haymitch and scared by the arm. She said one word, which was not sob-ridden-but emotionless. "Walk." Scared scaredly walked forward, Haymitch fiddling while walking.

&amp;#x200B;

We reached a large machine, which seemed super odd. it had a chair in it. WE forced scared in and rolled. 15.

Scared would feel the feeling of it melting onto his skin, and felt compelled to do as the hooded figure said. ( a -5 to any struggle against his orders)

&amp;#x200B;

he tries to rip it off, freaking out but fails. The hooded figure speaks, and he understands what they said. "Stop, walk forward. " He is unable to resist and feels his legs moving without his will. he is now standing by Crystal.

&amp;#x200B;

Haymitch rolls to replace the mask with a drama mask. I sigh and roll. ( his character was a mix of a bard and a rouge.) 20, FUGITY FUDGE.

&amp;#x200B;

the fake mask is pretty much plastered to his face. he then feels a sharp pain, as a communication device was inserted in his ear. "Stand here as well..."

&amp;#x200B;

He stood over by crystal, but secretly deactivated the mask. (20 again, really?)

&amp;#x200B;

while this was all happening, chicken hound took Druid and BLitz downward to the mines. masked people with snakes on their shoulders where whipping druids and humans, who were not masked, as they build a fortress? Who was overseeing it all? a cloaked human wearing a speckled jacket. "Way- ello Blatz, druuu-ad." \*deadpan voice\* "welcome to *Slagars* kingdom." Druid and blitz looked confused\* "Wot, did yu really bey-leve my name waz Clay-Rise?" She said tauntingly, before cackling.

&amp;#x200B;

Chicken hound snapped on two electric collars while they were distracted, and looked at Clarisse. in a Darth-vadery voice, he says "What do I set it to, master...?"

&amp;#x200B;

"Set is to....level P. I need two new ones since the last two stabbed themselves to death with a pencil....."

&amp;#x200B;

Click.

&amp;#x200B;

the two felt horrid pain and were forced to their hands and knees. then, a low hum of shock still, to keep them from thinking properly with the colors on. Blitch screeched out "I thought you were my friend!"

&amp;#x200B;

"Ah, ah , ah! a pet shouldn't speak. Chicken hound, flick on SR."

&amp;#x200B;

The druid tried to curse at them but seemed unable to speak. all the sound she could make was a low whine.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, Haymitch, Crystal, and scared were able to escape and were searching for Clarisse, blitz, and druid. they found the slave market, were Clarisse was watching. then she saw us and fakely made a 'help, go back there' Singh.

&amp;#x200B;

they rolled for suspicion. Scared and crystal fell for it. Haymitch decided to search the large room by the other. as they closed the door, he came upon Clarisse's two new pets. That meant blitz and druid scandalously clothed on all fours trying to turn off shock colors with their noses without standing up or making noise. a funny sight if the situation wasn't so dire. Haymitch cursed, and ran over, figuring out how to deactivate the colors. the two had a large red band (like a burn) on their neck and had to roll on how gravely this affected them. blitz was too afraid to speak and was later found out to be turned mute from trying to talk too much. Druid was fine. she snarled three words, putting an arm around blitz as he stumbled up. "Don't. Trust. Clarisse."

&amp;#x200B;

The two limped out of the room and opened the door scared and Crystal was in. they were struggling against chicken hound as he brutally whipped them, trying to get collars onto them. panic ensues, and crystal notices this is an armory. her rapier lays on the wall. she rolls a 20 and impales chicken hound without thinking. the bloodied pilot collapses, the mask falling to reveal a tearful face with blinded eyes. a face with a struggling look.

&amp;#x200B;

eventually, they escape the compound without Clarisse. now the island. build a boat and get out of this hell

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit salty, as they escaped far too early with little torture. halfway through the island, crystal lags behind and kneels over. she turns back and runs up. I roll to see if the notice anything...off. NOPE, WE GOOD!

&amp;#x200B;

eventually, Haymitch and crystal are chatting, as they are the only dragon-borns of the group. then, she slams a mask onto him. in the night, she captures everyone. expect the druid. "Find the tree hugger! Master Asmodeus will punish tho for your escape!"

&amp;#x200B;

Druid runs for the beach. she had escaped by hiding in a tree. she ran, then got jumped on the beach. she screamed "NO! I can't go back- I need to save them!" As she punched one of them in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

The two who jumped her paused, and relooked druid, "Y-your not mind controlled! YOUR NOT MIND CONTROLLED! D-D-Dave this is an actual person!"

&amp;#x200B;

the two celebrated. they both had a scar around their neck. "I need to save blitz... I can leave him..."

&amp;#x200B;

The two pause, and examine druid up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

"You too?"

&amp;#x200B;

Druid looks up, confused. "Mee...too?"

&amp;#x200B;

"Slagar. They marked you." Dave said, tracing the scar around druids neck, then to the one around their own.

&amp;#x200B;

"We escaped a few weeks ago."

&amp;#x200B;

"How...? Clar-I mean Slagar.... they said that the last two people committed suicide with a pencil?

&amp;#x200B;

"Ah, quite the opposite. we used a pencil to turn off the electric collars.!"

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, they planned to save the group.in this time, they all got tortured well. however, the group and Dave escaped the island (The other one got captured and the could not save them)



Crystal: Crystal was traumatized, and house for weeks, not stepping outside of it, with her little sister, crying herself to sleep. she never got over the nightmares of seeing chicken hounds face after she killed him. she still has the rapier, though.

&amp;#x200B;

 Haymitch: Haymitch wasn't to affected by this, and figured out he had a knack for finding out supervillains. Soon, he became HAYMITCH THE DRUNK DRAGON (hero)

&amp;#x200B;

Blitz: Blitz was found out to have been made permanently become mute due to injuries to her vocal cords. She stayed with the two others who knew what they had been through.

&amp;#x200B;

Druid: druid used to drink a lot, like Haymitch.  She stopped drinking to help comfort blitz after-well-what they went through. pretty much the same with Dave.

&amp;#x200B;

Scared: When scared got home, his brother (overprotectively) Kept him in the house for a while. NO ONE TOUCHES SCARED.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarisse and MR.Asmodeus: ??????

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, we did another one-shot with these characters that continued this story. if you are interested, say so, and I'll make a post and link it in the comments below!

Scared would feel the feeling of it melting onto his skin, and felt compelled to do as the hooded figure said. ( a -5 to any struggle against his orders)

&amp;#x200B;

he tries to rip it off, freaking out but fails. The hooded figure speaks, and he understands what they said. "Stop, walk forward. " He is unable to resist and feels his legs moving without his will. he is now standing by Crystal.

&amp;#x200B;

Haymitch rolls to replace the mask with a drama mask. I sigh and roll. ( his character was a mix of a bard and a rouge.) 20, FUGITY FUDGE.

&amp;#x200B;

the fake mask is pretty much plastered to his face. he then feels a sharp pain, as a communication device was inserted in his ear. "Stand here as well..."

&amp;#x200B;

He stood over by crystal, but secretly deactivated the mask. (20 again, really?)

&amp;#x200B;

while this was all happening, chicken hound took Druid and BLitz downward to the mines. masked people with snakes on their shoulders where whipping druids and humans, who were not masked, as they build a fortress? Who was overseeing it all? a cloaked human wearing a speckled jacket. "Way- ello Blatz, druuu-ad." \*deadpan voice\* "welcome to Slagars kingdom." Druid and blitz looked confused\* "Wot, did yu really bey-leve my name waz Clay-Rise?" She said tauntingly, before cackling.

&amp;#x200B;

Chicken hound snapped on two electric collars while they were distracted, and looked at Clarisse. in a Darth-vadery voice, he says "What do I set it to, master...?"

&amp;#x200B;

"Set is to....level P. I need two new ones since the last two stabbed themselves to death with a pencil....."

&amp;#x200B;

Click.

&amp;#x200B;

the two felt horrid pain and were forced to their hands and knees. then, a low hum of shock still, to keep them from thinking properly with the colors on. Blitch screeched out "I thought you were my friend!"

&amp;#x200B;

"Ah, ah , ah! a pet shouldn't speak. Chicken hound, flick on SR.

&amp;#x200B;

The druid tried to curse at them but seemed unable to speak. all the sound she could make was a low whine.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, Haymitch, Crystal, and scared were able to escape and were searching for Clarisse, blitz, and druid. they found the slave market, were Clarisse was watching. then she saw us and fakely made a 'help, go back there' Singh.

&amp;#x200B;

they rolled for suspicion. Scared and crystal fell for it. Haymitch decided to search the large room by the other. as they closed the door, he came upon Clarisse's two new pets. That meant blitz and druid scandalously clothed on all fours trying to turn off shock colors with their noses without standing up or making noise. a funny sight if the situation wasn't so dire. Haymitch cursed, and ran over, figuring out how to deactivate the colors. the two had a large red band (like a burn) on their neck and had to roll on how gravely this affected them. blitz was too afraid to speak and was later found out to be turned mute from trying to talk too much. Druid was fine. she snarled three words, putting an arm around blitz as he stumbled up. "Don't. Trust. Clarisse."

&amp;#x200B;

The two limped out of the room and opened the door scared and Crystal was in. they were struggling against chicken hound as he brutally whipped them, trying to get collars onto them. panic ensues, and crystal notices this is an armory. her rapier lays on the wall. she rolls a 20 and impales chicken hound without thinking. the bloodied pilot collapses, the mask falling to reveal a tearful face with blinded eyes. a face with a struggling look.

&amp;#x200B;

eventually, they escape the compound without Clarisse. now the island. build a boat and get out of this hell

&amp;#x200B;

I was a bit salty, as they escaped far too early with little torture. halfway through the island, crystal lags behind and kneels over. she turns back and runs up. I roll to see if the notice anything...off. NOPE, WE GOOD!

&amp;#x200B;

eventually, Haymitch and crystal are chatting, as they are the only dragon-borns of the group. then, she slams a mask onto him. in the night, she captures everyone. expect the druid. "Find the tree hugger! Master Asmodeus will punish tho for your escape!"

&amp;#x200B;

Druid runs for the beach. she had escaped by hiding in a tree. she ran, then got jumped on the beach. she screamed "NO! I can't go back- I need to save them!" As she punched one of them in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

The two who jumped her paused, and relooked druid, "Y-your not mind controlled! YOUR NOT MIND CONTROLLED! D-D-Dave this is an actual person!"

&amp;#x200B;

the two celebrated. they both had a scar around their neck. "I need to save blitz... I can leave him..."

&amp;#x200B;

The two pause, and examine druid up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

"You too?"

&amp;#x200B;

Druid looks up, confused. "Mee...too?"

&amp;#x200B;

"Slagar. They marked you." Dave said, tracing the scar around druids neck, then to the one around their own.

&amp;#x200B;

"We escaped a few weeks ago."

&amp;#x200B;

"How...? Clar-I mean Slagar.... they said that the last two people committed suicide with a pencil?

&amp;#x200B;

"Ah, quite the opposite. we used a pencil to turn off the electric collars.!"

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, they planned to save the [group.in](https://group.in) this time, they all got tortured well. however, the group and Dave escaped the island (The other one got captured and the could not save them)



Crystal: Crystal was traumatized, and house for weeks, not stepping outside of it, with her little sister, crying herself to sleep. she never got over the nightmares of seeing chicken hounds face after she killed him. she still has the rapier, though.

&amp;#x200B;

 Haymitch: Haymitch wasn't to affected by this, and figured out he had a knack for finding out supervillains. Soon, he became HAYMITCH THE DRUNK DRAGON (hero)

&amp;#x200B;

Blitz: Blitz was found out to have been made permanently become mute due to injuries to her vocal cords. She stayed with the two others who knew what they had been through.

&amp;#x200B;

Druid: druid used to drink a lot, like Haymitch.  She stopped drinking to help comfort blitz after-well-what they went through. pretty much the same with Dave.

&amp;#x200B;

Scared: When scared got home, his brother (overprotectively) Kept him in the house for a while. NO ONE TOUCHES SCARED.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarisse and MR.Asmodeus: ?

DANR YOU HAYMITCH  (Firstly, This was my first ever time playing DnD, and also DM-ing it. So I made a totally homebrewed game that I just used dice in XD. )

&amp;#x200B;

 OOOK.  Heres the cast:

Crystal: My Dragonborn NPC that I played in game whilst dm-ing. used to get the players back from derailing the campaign. they lost their memory in an attack from a rare type of carnivorous plants and retired from adventuring soon after, wanting to live with her family (Too bad crystal, you are not getting that)

&amp;#x200B;

Haymitch: A Dragonborn rouge who hated my guts. the character was a drunk, and my good old buddy couldn't figure out a name so I slyly referenced hunger games and HAYMITCH THE DRUNK DRAGON was born.

&amp;#x200B;

Druid/ Old forest goblin: A druid who never told us her name in the game. she hated everyone except trees. she loved trees. "DONT TOUCH MY TREEEEEEEEEEE"

&amp;#x200B;

Scared: A Homebrewed species called "Endo." They have oddly large jaws, are short, and have dark black scale-leather-skin stuff. 12 years old. Their name is their personality, honestly. ,., "WHY MUST IT RAINNNN. thunder is scary ,3,

&amp;#x200B;

Clarisse: A sweet, squeaky voice, normal human. she secretly is insane and ended up working for the villain. has an assent. a very western accent with a high pitch ear bleeding voice.....my ears are still damaged ,.,

&amp;#x200B;

FLAMIN BALL OF FIRE\~ (also called blitz): A Psychic that watches the world burn 24/7. trusts their friend enough not to use his powers on them.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr.Asmodues: The villain. mind controls anyone who dares show their face. "Look into my eyes, and I will show you eternityyyyy...." (Get the reference and I am happy.)

&amp;#x200B;

Chickenhound: One of the evil villain's minions. was a pilot. (also a reference from the same place)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK STORYTIME FOR FIRST DND GAME ONESHOT

&amp;#x200B;

The party was flying on an expensive plane, chatting with each other. Haymitch and Druid were having a drinking contest, Clarisse was 'innocently' watching as blitz made a dragon flying about with some FiRe\~. Crystal was talking to her little sister, Gemstone, on the phone. Scared was texting his older brother, Evil, silent in the back. telling himself everything was fine, and such. The Pilot came over the intercom and said the following. "We are experiencing turbulence, please stay calm."

&amp;#x200B;

Clarrise shouted over her shoulder. "Gotttt it Chik-ayn Ound!" Then, we went into a dive, speeding. Everyone freaked out, and only one person rolled high enough to not blackout. The pilot, Chicken Hound.

&amp;#x200B;

My character was the first to wake up and found themselves laying upside down on a tree limb. Chicken hound was nowhere to be seen. My character climbed down the tree, luckily sustaining nothing but a slightly sprained ankle. "Guys-are you ok!"

&amp;#x200B;

She noticed a flare signal burst out of the water, a thumbs up, and a 'need first aid' sign. soon, a FLAMIN BALL OF FIRE emerged from the water, holding scared, who was out-cold with a broken leg and a large shard of glass stabbed inches from his heart. (he rolled a one on his first roll. Rip. ,.,)

&amp;#x200B;

Crystal, panicked, looked around whilst  The old forest goblin ran from the broken hull of the plane, holding the first aid hit, Clarisse behind her. while we were reviving Scared, Haymitch came out of this woods, one of hears ears ripped off.

&amp;#x200B;

after we bandaged all the wounds and such, we started looking for chicken hound then we heard something from the jungle. "Assssmooodeeus...? \*chuckle\* Look into my eyessss.....I shalll give you eternittyy...." There was a loud snap, a scream, then silence.

&amp;#x200B;

Scared started crying and shaking, with Crystal trying to comfort him, looking at the jungle with a lost look in her eye. a look of remembering, and sadness. Haymitch was still drunk, and it took both blitz and the old forest goblin to hold him back. Clarisse, on the other hand, screamed ut. "Char-ga! Weh must trayy and sav Chik-ayn OUND!"

&amp;#x200B;

So we regrouped, and all followed Clarisse through the jungle, leaving an s.o.s sign with sticks in the sand. we mainly were looking for food, but Clarisse insisted we at least look for the body. a bit of hunting later, Crystal froze. I made everyone else roll to see if they saw what she saw.   Haymitch, Blitz, scared, and druid fell into a large pitcher-plant like a carnivorous plant. when they landed in it, they hardly had time to move before they were out cold. That left Crystal with Clarrise. Crystal was petrified with fear, as a similar plant, designed to poison and confuse their victims, had made her lose her memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarisse brushed this off, and grabbed a vine, slowly climbing in and pulling them in without taking in a breath. this took multiple dice rolls and she had to go in and out. to get them out. then, Clarisse OOC whispered something to me. My smile widened as I derailed my own campaign, rewriting it in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Crystal heard a rustle in the bushes and turned slightly. A small snake slithered out of the brush. Crystal had lost her memory, if you remember, and had no knowledge it was a KING COBRA :D. she petted it innocently, until it reared back, and BIT HER. she stared at the bite as I rolled. 1. SHe crumpled to the floor, screaming in agony as she withered with pain then she stopped. the snake slithered forward and wrapped around her head. Druid and Haymitch were our of the plant by now, and they rolled to see if they woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

they both woke up and saw Crystal as she screamed, then slowly got up. Crystal carried a large rapier with her. always. HEr bright blue eyes were swirling with a sickly green color. she grabbed her rapier and swung at Haymitch. Scared was out now, but wasn't up.

&amp;#x200B;

Crystal hit Haymitch in the arm, which was almost cut off. he, hating me even more, grabbed Clarisse's sword. he stole it and slashed at the snake wrapped around crystals neck. 1. (this dice is CURSED) He fumbled, and one of her horns was sliced. clean. off. She screamed in agony, as druid tried to knock the snake off. she rolled a 5. the snake bit her, and she was withering on the ground in pain.

&amp;#x200B;

a few turns later, everyone woke up chained to a wall. except for Clarisse. Crystal was also in sight, but not on the wall. she had a large mask on her face, and was standing next to...chiken hound? they were both silent, guarding the cell. the masks seemed fused to their face in an odd way...

&amp;#x200B;

Scared looked at crystal and broke into tears. "I WANNA GO HOME! I WANNA SEE MY BROTHER!" I quickly rolled the dice for how badly my character would react. my character rolled 20 and ended up beating scared till he shut up with a long spear. Haymitch started cursing at me and also got beat. Druid seemed dead inside, and blitz was out of it, rocking back and forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, a long cloaked figure walked over. it hissed something, and crystal walked in, grabbing Haymitch and scared by the arm. She said one word, which was not sob-ridden-but emotionless. "Walk." Scared scaredly walked forward, Haymitch fiddling while walking.

&amp;#x200B;

We reached a large machine, which seemed super odd. it had a chair in it. WE forced scared in and rolled. 15.

Scared would feel the feeling of it melting onto his skin, and felt compelled to do as the hooded figure said. ( a -5 to any struggle against his orders)

&amp;#x200B;

he tries to rip it off, freaking out but fails. The hooded figure speaks, and he understands what they said. "Stop, walk forward. " He is unable to resist and feels his legs moving without his will. he is now standing by Crystal.

&amp;#x200B;

Haymitch rolls to replace the mask with a drama mask. I sigh and roll. ( his character was a mix of a bard and a rouge.) 20, FUGITY FUDGE.

&amp;#x200B;

the fake mask is pretty much plastered to his face. he then feels a sharp pain, as a communication device was inserted in his ear. "Stand here as well..."

Review of my first order 👍🏽 I got my first order yesterday and after getting stuck into it I didn’t get round to leaving a review.... in fact I didn’t get round to doing much haha!!
I went for some pineapple and Dolato for my first order and I have to say I am blown away with the quality.

Let’s start with the pineapple 🍍 visually it looks  light and vibrant in colour.... incredible, beautiful smell and a nice smooth smoke. I find it was perfect for ya daytime puff!!

Now for the Dolato... the smell is very powerful... I pop the lid off my pot and the room has an immediate air freshener 🤣 it is darker in colour but covered in crystals and does exactly wot it says it does A1 Knockout!!
Hope all have had a good weekend!!

Entitled dad thinks it's okay to strangle me over a sock This happened 3-4 years ago and some bits of the story may not be accurate (namely what was said, what was done is still burned into my memory.)

Some stuff about my life not too relevant just nice to know:

I'd also like to say that my dad is a wonderful person plus he's a farmer so he has a very heavy farmer accent(told me that ever since he became a farmer he wanted to sound like one and it eventually became his natural voice), however he's in his late 40s at the time of this story and has a very old-fashioned mindset when it comes to punishments (For example, he would grab me, shake me about a bit while yelling and twst me round the head if i so much as said 'bloody hell') so he was very scary back when i wasn't a few inches taller than him. He never seriously hurt me but he still, in my mum's opinion, go a bit overboard.

End of life stuff.

D=dad
Me.........what, you need me to tell you...really...no you don't you liar you keep this up and I swear to god I'll... be upset at the most 'cuz it's the internet and i can't do much from here.


Just for some context, it's around 10:00 pm and I'm at my dad's house (my parents divorced when i was 4 so i only got to see him on weekends until my most recent move a few years ago i now only see him on half-term holidays.) Anyways I'm in my room in my pajamas playing games on my laptop when my dad walks in.
He says hello, how're you, all that stuff but then asks me if I'd changed my underwear.
Me: Yes, dad.
Dad: So why can't i find your socks in the wash basket.
 (Laundry basket full of stuff to be washed for you foreigners)
Me: I dunno i just chucked my clothes in there and assumed i grabbed everything.
Dad: Well, come check it, bud, so that i can be sure I'm not being stupid again. (he had a history of being an idiot.)
Me: If it makes you happy.

So i head over the the wash basket with dear old dad and have a rummage before finding a single black sock that i recognised as mine but, because i couldn't find the other one, he assumed it was his (mind you, his socks and mine weren't much different apart from the slight size difference)

Me: Well, i found one but i can't find the other, I'll check my room for it.
Dad: (slightly miffed) alright but if you don't find it then I'll go ballistic with you
Me: (very britishly) ...you wot...
Dad: because if you can't find it then that means you're lying to me.
Me: Ok (i couldn't really argue because, while i love him more than anything (except for my mum), he is a dimwit, having never gone to school, passed GCSE's and A-levels/college etc.)
Anyways, we get to my room and turn almost, ALMOST (this is important), the entire thing upside down but with no luck.

After a good 5 minutes he turns around and starts yelling at me:
Dad: You've been lying to me haven't you, boy.

And before i can retort, he grabs me BY THE NECK and shoves me into the wardrobe so hard that it bent inwards and broke the hinges (not enough that it snapped the door off it was just bent inwards a little)
Then he continues yelling:
Dad: STUPID BOY, STOP LYING TO ME AND TELL ME THE FRIGGIN' TRUTH. DID. YOU. CHANGE. YOUR. SOCKS.
(Bear in mind, also, that i had identical black socks on so you couldn't notice the difference without smelling them)
I gather my courage enough that i can finally utter feebly:
Me: Y-yes dad i did i swear i don't know what happened to the other on-
He cuts me off
Dad: OF COURSE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T CHANGE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
At this point, despite being a teenage boy, i start to cry (i always did and still do when I'm stressed because i don't want to yell at or hit anyone)
But instead of giving me the chance to talk he just shouts:
Dad: STOP WITH THE WATERWORKS AND TELL ME THE TRUTH.

I then get an idea.
I calm myself and tell my dad to let me go and I'll show him my other sock. He finally relents and lets me scamper under my bed to look for it.
'Lo and behold it's right bleeding there, half upright against the leg of my bed after it had been pushed there by my duvet.
My dad snatches it off of me and gives it a smell before recoiling in disgust. It was definitely my sock and, just in case, i brought the other one to him to smell but he told me not to bother. (Little petty revenge right there.)

Dad: I'm so sorry, spud (his favourite nickname for me)
I honestly thought that the other'un was mine and that you were lying... I didn't hurt you, did I.
Me: No, not at all i was just scared. Although the wardrobe's seen better days you massive wally.
Dad: Don't worry, spud I'll sort it.
Me:...
Dad:...
Me: So how did my sock smell.
Dad: It was absolutely rank. I don't understand how it gets that bad in just a day.
Me: You should know though weren't you a teenager once. Or are you too old to remember.
Dad: You cheeky sod.

The conversation went on for a while but halfway my mum in law came to see what was up but saw my red-raw eyes from crying and my dad sat beside me and assumed that he was trying to comfort me for some reason.

Quick aftermath summary:
I was perfectly fine, no real damage done as my dad didn't actually grasp my neck that hard, my wardrobe has new hinges and i never told anyone because nothing really affected me or him in any way other than an incident to laugh at.

I have a few more stories about my dad and me that I'd love to share but I'll see how this does first.

Also if there's a better place to post this let me know please.

Entitled dad tries to strangle me because of a sock. Was told by an auto-mod to post here because i need 100 karma to post on entitled parents.

So i head over the the wash basket with dear old dad and have a rummage before finding a single black sock that i recognised as mine but, because i couldn't find the other one, he assumed it was his (mind you, his socks and mine weren't much different apart from the slight size difference)

Me: Well, i found one but i can't find the other, I'll check my room for it.

Dad: (slightly miffed) alright but if you don't find it then I'll go ballistic with you

Me: (very britishly) ...you wot...

Dad: because if you can't find it then that means you're lying to me.

Me: Ok (i couldn't really argue because, while i love him more than anything (except for my mum), he is a dimwit, having never gone to school, passed GCSE's and A-levels/college etc.)

Anyways, we get to my room and turn almost, ALMOST (this is important), the entire thing upside down but with no luck.

After a good 5 minutes he turns around and starts yelling at me:

Dad: You've been lying to me haven't you, boy.

And before i can retort, he grabs me BY THE NECK and shoves me into the wardrobe so hard that it bent inwards and broke the hinges (not enough that it snapped the door off it was just bent inwards a little)
Then he continues yelling:

Dad: STUPID BOY, STOP LYING TO ME AND TELL ME THE FRIGGIN' TRUTH. DID. YOU. CHANGE. YOUR. SOCKS.
(Bear in mind, also, that i had identical black socks on so you couldn't notice the difference without smelling them)

I gather my courage enough that i can finally utter feebly:

Me: Y-yes dad i did i swear i don't know what happened to the other on-

He cuts me off

Dad: OF COURSE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T CHANGE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

At this point, despite being a teenage boy, i start to cry (i always did and still do when I'm stressed because i don't want to yell at or hit anyone)

But instead of giving me the chance to talk he just shouts:

Dad: STOP WITH THE WATERWORKS AND TELL ME THE TRUTH.

I then get an idea.
I calm myself and tell my dad to let me go and I'll show him my other sock. He finally relents and lets me scamper under my bed to look for it.
'Lo and behold it's right bleeding there, half upright against the leg of my bed after it had been pushed there by my duvet.
My dad snatches it off of me and gives it a smell before recoiling in disgust. It was definitely my sock and, just in case, i brought the other one to him to smell but he told me not to bother. (Little petty revenge right there.)

Dad: I'm so sorry, spud (his favourite nickname for me)
I honestly thought that the other'un was mine and that you were lying... I didn't hurt you, did I.

Me: No, not at all i was just scared. Although the wardrobe's seen better days you massive wally.

Dad: Don't worry, spud I'll sort it.

Me:...

Dad:...

Me: So how did my sock smell.

Dad: It was absolutely rank. I don't understand how it gets that bad in just a day.

Me: You should know though weren't you a teenager once. Or are you too old to remember.

Dad: You cheeky sod.

The conversation went on for a while but halfway my mum in law came to see what was up but saw my red-raw eyes from crying and my dad sat beside me and assumed that he was trying to comfort me for some reason.

Quick aftermath summary:
I was perfectly fine, no real damage done as my dad didn't actually grasp my neck that hard, my wardrobe has new hinges and i never told anyone because nothing really affected me or him in any way other than an incident to laugh at.

I have a few more stories about my dad and me that I'd love to share but I'll see how this does first.

Also if there's a better place to post this let me know please.

A story involving a snooty rich paladin, the decline of city planning, a pair of holy weapons, and why you shouldn't be an asshole to people accepting your quests &gt; Be me: Human Paladin, LG and Devout follower of the Goddess of Peace

&gt; Be not me: Minotaur Barbarian, Dwarf Fighter, Elf Ranger, Elf Wizard (DMing)

&gt; All of us put in charge of running a kingdom

&gt; Somehow managed to go several sessions without committing regicide multiple times over

&gt; Got a sweet Church of Peace set up right across the street to the Church of Battle

&gt; Had a rough start but they both accepted that each has a place in this world

&gt; Share community events together

&gt; BBQ's were great

&gt; Everything was going swell

&gt; loudobnoxioushorns.mp3

&gt; Me, Minotaur Barbarian, Elf Ranger, and Dwarf Fighter all get out to see what's up

&gt; Elf Wizard is currently locked in his wizard tower studying the dankest of magics

&gt; Find a parade of overly polished knights being lead by what looks like Sauron if he was made of the shiniest chrome armor you could find

&gt; Man is literally bloom incarnate

&gt; Kobold's would treat him as a god

&gt; Man walks up and says that he is Platinum Paladin

&gt; Worships Bahamut, the greatest of Dragon Gods

&gt; Takes off his helmet

&gt; Man looks like a dude posing on the cover of a $2 romance novel

&gt; Probably something named "My Knight's Shining Blade" or "The Cavalier's Lance"

&gt; Says that he has heard of our Kingdom and wishes to build a grand church in his God's name here

&gt; Thinks we won't do it

&gt; Sure ma dude, just put it in the Cathedral District with all the other ones

&gt; Guy pays only in platinum coins

&gt; Who fucking even does that?

&gt; Says all of his armor is platinum

&gt; Cool, your daddy buy it for you?

&gt; Says my armor looks dingy

&gt; Boi

&gt; Mine get's to see some use, unlike yours

&gt; Other party members take over the conversation

&gt; Don't want to start a holy war in the middle of the street

&gt; After he picks out the plot of land and starts setting up shop, he comes and says he has a favor to ask

&gt; shoveit.jpeg

&gt; Says that he lost his holy sword and shield, a gift from Bahamut, atop a great mountain to the east

&gt; How the fuck you go and do that?

&gt; Did you just like, climb and mountain and forget?

&gt; Ma dude, I feel bad for Bahamut if that's what he has to put up with

&gt; Dude straight up forgetting essential artifacts gifted to him by literal gods

&gt; Daddy Bahamut please get me a new ISword and AirShields, I lost mine

&gt; The party agrees to help and I begrudgingly come with

&gt; Mountain is cold as hell

&gt; Armor stuffed to the brim with furs to keep warm

&gt; Like a sheep is hugging you

&gt; Actually pretty good

&gt; Fight a bunch of rock monsters and a troll

&gt; None of them really pose a threat

&gt; We mostly let gravity do a lot of the work

&gt; Be surprised how much damage a mountain can contribute in a fight

&gt; Get to the top of the mountain

&gt; Sure enough

&gt; "Roll to see if you are tempted to steal the holy sword and shield"

&gt; Fuck I don't want that shite, don't even use a sword and board

&gt; Got a sick ass scythe and dagger

&gt; Tied to a backstory as a simple farm girl turned paladin

&gt; Roll a Nat20 to not be tempted

&gt; Consider tossing the two hunks of platinum off the side of the mountain

&gt; "Desecrating another LG god's holy weapons will probably effect your standings with your own"

&gt; Pfft, wot

&gt; Decide that it's probs not worth it

&gt; Chuck it into the bag with all the other crap we got

&gt; Constantly being told of the craftsmanship of the equipment

&gt; How they seem to be calling to me

&gt; Use detect evil just to be safe

&gt; Nah, they good, just apparently the platinum is just oh so tempting

&gt; Apparently

&gt; Get back to town

&gt; Hand off the Platinum Paladin's holy toys

&gt; Tell him he should probably not forget them on his travels

&gt; He mentions how he's surprised I didn't steal them

&gt; I tell him that some paladins actually have honor and dignity

&gt; He get's mad and wants to fight me in the streets

&gt; Minotaur Barbarian, Elf Ranger and Dwarf Fighter are eating popcorn on the sidelines

&gt; Accept's his challenge to a duel

&gt; Asks me what the conditions are

&gt; Keep it traditional, first to yield loses, no killing, and no outside assistance

&gt; Asks what I want if I win

&gt; Tell him there's nothing he has that I care for, so I say if I win it's just bragging rights

&gt; This makes the rich kid mad

&gt; He says if he wins he gets to shut down my Church

&gt; Cool.png

&gt; Agree and the fight starts

&gt; Literally spend the next 15 mins kiting him with my extra long scythe

&gt; Every time he closes in I get a free hit

&gt; Apparently the dude has no healing spells

&gt; Only damaging spells

&gt; okay.mov

&gt; Fight was super close but Platinum Paladin is basically almost dead

&gt; I'm also almost dead

&gt; Tell him to yield

&gt; Says he will never yield

&gt; I tell him he will die if he doesn't

&gt; Says he will still not yield

&gt; I yield

&gt; "Wait you what?"

&gt; I yield

&gt; Platinum Paladin asks why

&gt; Tell him that if he refuses to yield, then I will yield

&gt; Tell him that I'd rather not waste a life over a pathetic argument

&gt; Tell him that I will even keep my word and close the Church of Peace, for it's not the building that matters, only the lessons of goodwill and teachings of peace that matter

&gt; Platinum Paladin is flustered

&gt; Tells me that I don't have to close the Church of Peace

&gt; He's kind of mad but also knows that what I said is true

&gt; allaccordingtokeikaku.exe

&gt; We agree to essentially hate each other but at a respectable and professional distance

&gt; Several months later the Church of Bahamut now stands across the street to the Church of Battle and the Church of Peace

&gt; They don't come to the community BBQ's

[Community Advice Request] B8.5 A4 2.0 Quattro // 36K Miles // Slippage after APR Stage 1 Hello Audi Fam!

Some quick info about my car:

2014 Audi A4 Quattro 6MT 36K miles. Spirited driving but no clutch dumps or burnouts under my watch.

Upgrades:   ECS Luft-technik intercooler system, NGK iridium spark plugs, fresh coil packs, Magnumflow Pro-Dry air filter, APR stage 1 tune.

The tune was installed two days ago. Since I've been experienced what appears to be clutch slippage. WOT results in reving without power in all gears. I never experienced any slippage prior to the tune so I was surprised to experience it short of stage 2 tuning. I'm the 2nd (or 3rd) owner of the car so I can't speak to how it was driven prior to my ownership but it's been babied for the last year.

I'm preparing to upgrade the clutch but the flywheel question has come up. Should this also be replaced while you have the transmission out? It doubles the cost up front but could delay any future work required. Any personal experience with specific clutch kits? SPEC, Clutch Master, South Bend, Luk, Sachs? Thank you, all, for any comments/suggestions.

Puch Maxi engine problems Full disclosure - I am not experienced with engines, I have toyed around and researched Puch motors since I bought mine last year.


[My Puch Maxi](https://external-preview.redd.it/sMyyCWiUZEiAifE7QgqUKO8oNSa8Su6srLLa0u_P5_4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ca35a80100174944fd0e4aa5cb88fd7e48373c79) can't propel itself from a standing start. If I plant my feet - it barely 'fights back'. It gets up to about 2 km/h on WOT and it revs really high.  I work around this by jogging it along until about 10 km/h, which is about the speed it needs to kick into second gear (I thought Puch's e50 were single-speed?). Once in second gear, it cruises up to about 30 km/h and runs reasonably well (afaik) besides four-stroking at certain speeds/throttle. I checked the carb, and can't find anything obviously wrong there - jet is clean etc.
My limited knowledge tells me that this is an air leak, but I thought that I would get another opinion before I buy restoration parts and start the season.

Day 16 Woke up 8ish. Shaved my head for the last time and hopped in the shower. Took the whip up to ACH, mostly traffic free to Mt. Wilson then back down to Angeles Forest Highway to Upper Big Tujunga Canyon Road. Turned around to climb back up and got some WOT time. Stupid fun.

Took apart my clothing steamer, boxed up some smalls, did some cleaning. No trip to Murrieta today, it was just too nice out. I'll be back Tuesday to swap cars for the last of the big things.

Arrange a lunch with a high school friend. He's worked in Pasadena for a few years but we never met up. He's a homeowner on schedule to retire on time so it will be a nice perspective to hear.

Finished up the Slime Isekai. It started so strongly to have ended with such a whimpering 4 episodes. Mob Psycho II was entertaining but, like SAO, was just setup for next week's fight.

I've been occupying myself with packing and cleaning, but whenever I get a quiet moment, I'm filled with terror. Nobody does this, probably for a good reason. I'd like to get this move done so I can get started on working on myself.

DARN YOU HAYMITCH This was a horror story for me to Dm so heres the story. Also, didnt use some of the actual names because it was a while ago XD.



Firstly, This was my first ever time playing DnD, and also DM-ing it. So I made a totally homebrewed game that I just used dice in XD. )

OOOK. Heres the cast:

Crystal: My Dragonborn NPC that I played in game whilst dm-ing. used to get the players back from derailing the campaign. they lost their memory in an attack from a rare type of carnivorous plants and retired from adventuring soon after, wanting to live with her family (Too bad crystal, you are not getting that)

Haymitch: A Dragonborn rouge who hated my guts. the character was a drunk, and my good old buddy couldn't figure out a name so I slyly referenced hunger games and HAYMITCH THE DRUNK DRAGON was born.

Druid/ Old forest goblin: A druid who never told us her name in the game. she hated everyone except trees. she loved trees. "DONT TOUCH MY TREEEEEEEEEEE"

Scared: A Homebrewed species called "Endo." They have oddly large jaws, are short, and have dark black scale-leather-skin stuff. 12 years old. Their name is their personality, honestly. ,., "WHY MUST IT RAINNNN. thunder is scary ,3,

Clarisse: A sweet, squeaky voice, normal human. she secretly is insane and ended up working for the villain. has an assent. a very western accent with a high pitch ear bleeding voice.....my ears are still damaged ,.,

FLAMIN BALL OF FIRE\~ (also called blitz): A Psychic that watches the world burn 24/7. trusts their friend enough not to use his powers on them.

Mr.Asmodues: The villain. mind controls anyone who dares show their face. "Look into my eyes, and I will show you eternityyyyy...." (Get the reference and I am happy.)

Chickenhound: One of the evil villain's minions. was a pilot. (also a reference from the same place)

OK STORYTIME FOR FIRST DND GAME ONESHOT

The party was flying on an expensive plane, chatting with each other. Haymitch and Druid were having a drinking contest, Clarisse was 'innocently' watching as blitz made a dragon flying about with some FiRe\~. Crystal was talking to her little sister, Gemstone, on the phone. Scared was texting his older brother, Evil, silent in the back. telling himself everything was fine, and such. The Pilot came over the intercom and said the following. "We are experiencing turbulence, please stay calm."

Clarrise shouted over her shoulder. "Gotttt it Chik-ayn Ound!" Then, we went into a dive, speeding. Everyone freaked out, and only one person rolled high enough to not blackout. The pilot, Chicken Hound.

My character was the first to wake up and found themselves laying upside down on a tree limb. Chicken hound was nowhere to be seen. My character climbed down the tree, luckily sustaining nothing but a slightly sprained ankle. "Guys-are you ok!"

She noticed a flare signal burst out of the water, a thumbs up, and a 'need first aid' sign. soon, a FLAMIN BALL OF FIRE emerged from the water, holding scared, who was out-cold with a broken leg and a large shard of glass stabbed inches from his heart. (he rolled a one on his first roll. Rip. ,.,)

Crystal, panicked, looked around whilst The old forest goblin ran from the broken hull of the plane, holding the first aid hit, Clarisse behind her. while we were reviving Scared, Haymitch came out of this woods, one of hears ears ripped off.

after we bandaged all the wounds and such, we started looking for chicken hound then we heard something from the jungle. "Assssmooodeeus...? \*chuckle\* Look into my eyessss.....I shalll give you eternittyy...." There was a loud snap, a scream, then silence.

Scared started crying and shaking, with Crystal trying to comfort him, looking at the jungle with a lost look in her eye. a look of remembering, and sadness. Haymitch was still drunk, and it took both blitz and the old forest goblin to hold him back. Clarisse, on the other hand, screamed ut. "Char-ga! Weh must trayy and sav Chik-ayn OUND!"

So we regrouped, and all followed Clarisse through the jungle, leaving an s.o.s sign with sticks in the sand. we mainly were looking for food, but Clarisse insisted we at least look for the body. a bit of hunting later, Crystal froze. I made everyone else roll to see if they saw what she saw. Haymitch, Blitz, scared, and druid fell into a large pitcher-plant like a carnivorous plant. when they landed in it, they hardly had time to move before they were out cold. That left Crystal with Clarrise. Crystal was petrified with fear, as a similar plant, designed to poison and confuse their victims, had made her lose her memory.

Clarisse brushed this off, and grabbed a vine, slowly climbing in and pulling them in without taking in a breath. this took multiple dice rolls and she had to go in and out. to get them out. then, Clarisse OOC whispered something to me. My smile widened as I derailed my own campaign, rewriting it in my head.

Crystal heard a rustle in the bushes and turned slightly. A small snake slithered out of the brush. Crystal had lost her memory, if you remember, and had no knowledge it was a KING COBRA :D. she petted it innocently, until it reared back, and BIT HER. she stared at the bite as I rolled. 1. SHe crumpled to the floor, screaming in agony as she withered with pain then she stopped. the snake slithered forward and wrapped around her head. Druid and Haymitch were our of the plant by now, and they rolled to see if they woke up.

they both woke up and saw Crystal as she screamed, then slowly got up. Crystal carried a large rapier with her. always. HEr bright blue eyes were swirling with a sickly green color. she grabbed her rapier and swung at Haymitch. Scared was out now, but wasn't up.

Crystal hit Haymitch in the arm, which was almost cut off. he, hating me even more, grabbed Clarisse's sword. he stole it and slashed at the snake wrapped around crystals neck. 1. (this dice is CURSED) He fumbled, and one of her horns was sliced. clean. off. She screamed in agony, as druid tried to knock the snake off. she rolled a 5. the snake bit her, and she was withering on the ground in pain.

a few turns later, everyone woke up chained to a wall. except for Clarisse. Crystal was also in sight, but not on the wall. she had a large mask on her face, and was standing next to...chiken hound? they were both silent, guarding the cell. the masks seemed fused to their face in an odd way...

Scared looked at crystal and broke into tears. "I WANNA GO HOME! I WANNA SEE MY BROTHER!" I quickly rolled the dice for how badly my character would react. my character rolled 20 and ended up beating scared till he shut up with a long spear. Haymitch started cursing at me and also got beat. Druid seemed dead inside, and blitz was out of it, rocking back and forth.

Eventually, a long cloaked figure walked over. it hissed something, and crystal walked in, grabbing Haymitch and scared by the arm. She said one word, which was not sob-ridden-but emotionless. "Walk." Scared scaredly walked forward, Haymitch fiddling while walking.

We reached a large machine, which seemed super odd. it had a chair in it. WE forced scared in and rolled. 15.

Scared would feel the feeling of it melting onto his skin, and felt compelled to do as the hooded figure said. ( a -5 to any struggle against his orders)

he tries to rip it off, freaking out but fails. The hooded figure speaks, and he understands what they said. "Stop, walk forward. " He is unable to resist and feels his legs moving without his will. he is now standing by Crystal.

Haymitch rolls to replace the mask with a drama mask. I sigh and roll. ( his character was a mix of a bard and a rouge.) 20, FUGITY FUDGE.

the fake mask is pretty much plastered to his face. he then feels a sharp pain, as a communication device was inserted in his ear. "Stand here as well..."

He stood over by crystal, but secretly deactivated the mask. (20 again, really?)

while this was all happening, chicken hound took Druid and BLitz downward to the mines. masked people with snakes on their shoulders where whipping druids and humans, who were not masked, as they build a fortress? Who was overseeing it all? a cloaked human wearing a speckled jacket. "Way- ello Blatz, druuu-ad." \*deadpan voice\* "welcome to *Slagars* kingdom." Druid and blitz looked confused\* "Wot, did yu really bey-leve my name waz Clay-Rise?" She said tauntingly, before cackling.

Chicken hound snapped on two electric collars while they were distracted, and looked at Clarisse. in a Darth-vadery voice, he says "What do I set it to, master...?"

"Set is to....level P. I need two new ones since the last two stabbed themselves to death with a pencil....."

Click.

the two felt horrid pain and were forced to their hands and knees. then, a low hum of shock still, to keep them from thinking properly with the colors on. Blitch screeched out "I thought you were my friend!"

"Ah, ah , ah! a pet shouldn't speak. Chicken hound, flick on SR."

The druid tried to curse at them but seemed unable to speak. all the sound she could make was a low whine.

Eventually, Haymitch, Crystal, and scared were able to escape and were searching for Clarisse, blitz, and druid. they found the slave market, were Clarisse was watching. then she saw us and fakely made a 'help, go back there' Singh.

they rolled for suspicion. Scared and crystal fell for it. Haymitch decided to search the large room by the other. as they closed the door, he came upon Clarisse's two new pets. That meant blitz and druid scandalously clothed on all fours trying to turn off shock colors with their noses without standing up or making noise. a funny sight if the situation wasn't so dire. Haymitch cursed, and ran over, figuring out how to deactivate the colors. the two had a large red band (like a burn) on their neck and had to roll on how gravely this affected them. blitz was too afraid to speak and was later found out to be turned mute from trying to talk too much. Druid was fine. she snarled three words, putting an arm around blitz as he stumbled up. "Don't. Trust. Clarisse."

The two limped out of the room and opened the door scared and Crystal was in. they were struggling against chicken hound as he brutally whipped them, trying to get collars onto them. panic ensues, and crystal notices this is an armory. her rapier lays on the wall. she rolls a 20 and impales chicken hound without thinking. the bloodied pilot collapses, the mask falling to reveal a tearful face with blinded eyes. a face with a struggling look.

eventually, they escape the compound without Clarisse. now the island. build a boat and get out of this hell

I was a bit salty, as they escaped far too early with little torture. halfway through the island, crystal lags behind and kneels over. she turns back and runs up. I roll to see if the notice anything...off. NOPE, WE GOOD!

eventually, Haymitch and crystal are chatting, as they are the only dragon-borns of the group. then, she slams a mask onto him. in the night, she captures everyone. expect the druid. "Find the tree hugger! Master Asmodeus will punish tho for your escape!"

Druid runs for the beach. she had escaped by hiding in a tree. she ran, then got jumped on the beach. she screamed "NO! I can't go back- I need to save them!" As she punched one of them in the face.

The two who jumped her paused, and relooked druid, "Y-your not mind controlled! YOUR NOT MIND CONTROLLED! D-D-Dave this is an actual person!"

the two celebrated. they both had a scar around their neck. "I need to save blitz... I can leave him..."

The two pause, and examine druid up and down.

"You too?"

Druid looks up, confused. "Mee...too?"

"Slagar. They marked you." Dave said, tracing the scar around druids neck, then to the one around their own.

"We escaped a few weeks ago."

"How...? Clar-I mean Slagar.... they said that the last two people committed suicide with a pencil?

"Ah, quite the opposite. we used a pencil to turn off the electric collars.!"

Soon, they planned to save the group.in this time, they all got tortured well. however, the group and Dave escaped the island (The other one got captured and the could not save them)

Crystal: Crystal was traumatized, and house for weeks, not stepping outside of it, with her little sister, crying herself to sleep. she never got over the nightmares of seeing chicken hounds face after she killed him. she still has the rapier, though.

Haymitch: Haymitch wasn't to affected by this, and figured out he had a knack for finding out supervillains. Soon, he became HAYMITCH THE DRUNK DRAGON (hero)

Blitz: Blitz was found out to have been made permanently become mute due to injuries to her vocal cords. She stayed with the two others who knew what they had been through.

Druid: druid used to drink a lot, like Haymitch. She stopped drinking to help comfort blitz after-well-what they went through. pretty much the same with Dave.

Scared: When scared got home, his brother (overprotectively) Kept him in the house for a while. NO ONE TOUCHES SCARED.

Clarisse and MR.Asmodeus: ??????

Turbo flutter suddenly louder? I already made a post previously about turbo flutter but today it suddenly got A LOT louder, but only in 3rd gear.
Mod list: k&amp;n Air filter with no airbox lid.

To specify, this is flutter under WOT, which I was told is normal because of how the ecu controls the turbo and Bpv and all that, but today I floored it in 3rd around 3500rpm and it was very loud compared to every other gear and rpm. I'm also 100% sure it was flutter, sounds exactly the same just louder. Please help 😭
